to speaking of money i  ' m lorraine han

in this half hour we discuss music piracy in many counties copies
of top hits for example are big business
""
but how is it affecting the music business as bottom line
""
with me in the stereo is leslie ching licensing manager of the
composers  '  and authors  '  society of hong kong or cash mr patrick wong who  ' s
the executive secretary of ifpi in hong kong
""
welcome gentlemen to the stereo thanks for joining me
""
  uhm   let me ask leslie first and how serious is the
problem of music piracy here in hong kong 
""
""
 good evening 
""
""
 thank you  
""
""
uh perhaps this is a very broad question
""
uhm perhaps let me  be  give a brief outline of what is 
piracy in music
 
""
sure 
""
""
uh it actually in legal term is an infringement of copyright
in the musical works or related matters 
""
uhm the law granted to music writers and composers a lot of rights
 each uh which include say uh reproducing the work in any material form
like compact disc uh cassettes laser disc et cetera
""
uh apart from that there are still some more rights uhm which
include broadcasting  uh performing in public  synchronization into
visual uh materials and also diffusion through cable
 
""
wow it  ' s a very broad  sort of umbrella 
""
""
yes
 
""
right uhm patrick is it a problem in hong kong or southeast asia
""
""
""
uhm  yes probably and  major problem is from cd piracy i
see
""
uhm in hong kong it  ' s coming to be a  serious issue  in in
uh  in the nearest future
""
because you can see that  uhm  there  ' s a lot of piracy from
from come from taiwan and japan 
""
you can see that uh uh  some little information about taiwan is
nine cd plants manufacture cd each each year
""
they can  produces  thirty billions uh cd each year but 
according to our information is  the legitimate  cd in taiwan is only
three million    
""
this ninety percent of the production are pirate
""
so we can see that  this serious problem in in this region for
the pirate cd we can see it everywhere malaysia hong kong uh singapore and
thailand
""
we can buy  pirate cd everywhere
 
""
  gosh   
""
uhm tell me is the quality just the same patrick 
""
""
the same   the same  the same as  the original
 
""
 the same  
""
god leslie how do you tell the difference then 
""
""
so what  ' s surprise
 
""
oh yes so what  ' s the
""
i mean it  ' s must be very much cheaper 
""
""
certainly
 
""
certainly
""
how much more fifty percent more patrick 
""
""
around uhm  fifty to uh sixty five hong kong dollars
 
""
which is  half the price 
""
""
yes   almost almost half the price 
 
""
 of the of the normal  
""
my goddess
""
so if we can't tell the price leslie what will what will you do
""
""
""
so apart and because uhm what  patr  patrick have cover
is on the record   piracy 
""
so so i just mention a lot of other rights   take 
granted to composers and many people are actually  infrinting 
infringing those rights 
""
say i  ' ve named the broadcasting of course all the  broadcasters
here is  very helpful   and 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 thank   you
""
metro included 
""
""
certainly and  uh but  uh everywhere uh along the street
in hong kong there are a lot of say restaurants  boutiques karaoke bars
""
they are all performing music in public    
""
they  ' re using our product to make profit
""
but  many of them i must say that  han   have not got
the uh legal permission
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
when you say they  ' re using your products the boutiques for
example what what do you mean 
""
""
my product is the performing right in the musical works 
 
""
so  what cash is doing is administer this right mainly in hong
kong
 
""
 oh i see  
""
i see and uhm is  is the industry at all getting together to do
something about this leslie 
""
""
basically now is cash working on   ourself 
""
because uhm you see there  ' s a lot of composers around the world
and  we cash actually own a large repertoire of works international
repertoire    
""
so everybody here using  the music say a popular song or what it
must be it must fall into our control
""
so we are actually own the pop copyright of those musical works and
everybody who are infringing    our  right   
 is cash right
""
so what we can do is at the end of the day put them into court
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uh legislation or get what sort of penalties do they face 
""
""
huge damage
 
""
what like what
""
  a lot of money or  uh prison sentence uh what sort of
""
""
""
 uhm  
""
now we are  uh mainly instituting civil proceedings   so
  in most of the case they won't have to go into jails
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
right just pay a lump   sum 
""
right what is uhm  ifpi doing patrick anything 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
uh you know ifpi represent a  uhm the  producers in hong
kong
""
uh of course the international company  so we are now we  ' re
discussing on the  action will be taken in the nearest future  
 
""
so i i cannot tell about the details in here
""
uhm i just can can tell you about  we  ' re we  ' re taking action
because  we can foresee that  there will be a great harm  to the
industry   in  the nearest future
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
do you have the right the legal right to take action of this sort
leslie 
""
""
yes we do   sure 
 
""
 uhm  
""
what about the government
""
have you ever asked the government to do something about this 
""
""
actually we have been collecting money from the government for
using our products
""
but uhm  the government have helped us a bit on uh mainly from
the customs and excise duty department
""
so they have  uh do a lot works in the last ten years or so i
think and they almost remove all the piracy plant here in hong kong on 
cassettes that is very active ten years ago   
""
but  now what is situation now here i think patrick is expert
here
 
""
 uhm uhm but  
""
yeah cds right patrick you said earlier 
""
""
yeah right  uhm i think one one major problem to recognize
the kind of cd is that is to to a layman or custom even a custom
""
we work with custom about how to recognize the pirate cd in hong
kong because they  now nowadays the pirate is very perfect
 
""
even the   cover right  
""
""
 even a cover the   inner cases  very beautiful
printing on on on that
""
so we  we must recognize on the cd  itself because every
manufacturer will have the print their  code  on the ring inner inner
ring of the cd
""
so we must recognize uh  from from that point
""
so we are we now we work with uh custom to educate them and to
cooperate them with to recognize them  uh to  make them easier to to
know what which is cd   which  is pirate cd i mean
 
""
 uhm  
""
but it  ' s still very difficult they would actually have uh 
 physically  open up the   cd and look at it  
""
""
 yes  
""
 yes if i you know uhm   that over thousand cd
plants in the world 
""
they they may possible to make pirate cd actually
 
""
yeah i got to go home and check about this inner ring
""
let  ' s take a short break and invite opinions of callers at three
three three zero four four four
""
the number again is three three three zero four four four 
""
welcome back to speaking of money
""
we  ' ve been discussing music piracy here in hong kong
""
with me in the stereo is mr leslie ching licensing manager of
cash which is the composers  '  and authors  '  society of hong kong
""
we also have mr patrick wong who  ' s the executive  sec 
secretary of ifpi hong kong which stands for the international federation of
phonographic industry i must get that right gentlemen
""
uhm let me come back and ask uhm patrick now 
""
with all the piracy going on how much has it affected the
industries  '  bottom line    lost  a lot of money 
""
""
 uhm  
""
in the mean time i think uhm  the major company in in hong kong
our  con  concern is the six major international company
""
because those pirate cds are major in the international repertoire
 but we can foresee this a trend to they will produce some pirate cd on
cantonese pop
""
so if  if this come true  the most of the company in hong
kong will be affected
 
""
uhm do have you got a  dollar figure as to how much revenue
you might have been lost as a result of all this piracy 
""
""
uhm
 
""
millions billions 
""
""
i think it  ' s millions    yeah 
 
""
 millions and   may go up to billions if nothing  ' s
  done right 
""
leslie     how is a composer or an author
actually uh protected here in hong kong
""
are there a lot of laws uh protecting him or her 
""
""
 sure sure  
""
""
 yeah  
""
yes there  ' s well defined law the copyright act here enforce
""
uh actually it  ' s a copy from  the united kingdom it is called
the copyright act of uh nineteen fifty six something like this 
""
uhm it is  quite well protected but still because some 
techno  technological changes developments here
""
uhm there are some drawbacks in the old version of the law  
 
""
so currently uh there is a law reform commission here  doing an
overview of all the law  is  hong kong including the copyright act
 
""
 uhm  
""
that right and they if i  ' m not i stand corrected and they 
uhm had said earlier that they were actually for  the legalizing  of
copyright  uh infringement for computers 
""
in other words they legalized that and therefore  then it
would eradicate the problem
""
do you see that happening in the music  or  side  of
things 
""
""
  uhm 
 
""
 have   you heard about   this uhm  
""
""
 a little   part of that yes
 
""
how do you feel about something like that 
""
""
uhm what the law reform commission have put forward is a
consultative paper
""
we have give a lot of feedbacks we support some of their views and
 objects some of the some of them as well
""
uh say there is one important areas in import parallel imports 
  so 
 
""
 what   do you mean by parallel   imports 
""
""
""
 uhm    it is importing the goods produce
somewhere
""
same products have already been here through a public channel so
there  ' re  other people are getting the product   cheap 
cheaper  and import it directly and for sale
""
this  ' s something like uhm the pirated cd  uh made in taiwan
   but of course   uhm we object that and we 
""
we think that we should maintain the previous system  that
parallel import must be ban
 
""
 uhm  
""
 right and how do you feel about that  
""
uhm uhm
""
what about you patrick
""
how do you feel about about  uh the possible legalizing of 
of something like pirated music  software 
""
""
of course the the producers uh object to  the release
control on on the pirate import because
""
the pirate import now nowadays in in hong kong  uh uh affect
 affecting our industry 
""
because  we we cannot  no control on that will will will be
 be mean a lot a bigger loss of  mon  money
 
""
right 
""
""
uhm  the government to take the computer software as
example is not very good example i think
""
because computer is completely different product 
""
 mus  music  indu  industry  the product cd is
complete  when you have pirate imports and original you buy in hong 
 kong is  completely  the same
 
""
 uhm  
""
right so patrick what can companies or producers do like  emi
or whatever what other warner brothers or whatever
""
what are what can they do actually to stop this or can they do
anything 
""
""
we can only  we can only stop those pirate  in 
which is they have  the licensee in hong kong
""
i mean the exclusive license they can sell they can import and 
and distributing in hong kong    
""
but  this quite number of the parallel import in hong kong now
is they haven't got any licensee
""
so we cannot stop that we can only  try to do  to stop to uh
those pirate imports which is we have licensee in hong kong
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm leslie canton pop  ' s very popular here 
""
""
yes
 
""
get a lot of people uhm  copying english songs if i may use
that term
""
is this permitted here in hong kong 
""
""
uh you mean it  ' s the cover version what we   usually
call 
 
""
 yeah like   you have uhm you have   michael
jackson  ' s new yeah something you know and and  and you sing it in
chinese 
""
""
 save the black cat okay yeah yeah  
""
uh they have already obtained the permission from the original 
copyright owner to make adapted version to use the cantonese uhm lyrics
 
""
right let  ' s take a caller here 
""
good evening 
 
""
  hello  
 
""
 hello   jack 
 
""
hello 
 
""
hello your question 
 
""
uh yes i  ' d like to put forward a proposition
""
uh we  ' re talking here about record companies losing money as a
consequence piracy
""
is it not equally fair to say that record company greed is what
leads to piracy in the first place
""
if pirates are able to produce cds at half the price that the
record company charges then it  ' s the record company  ' s fault of charging so
much
""
why can they not produce  the cd themselves at that price and
uh put the pirate out of business 
 
""
in other words  drop your price tag right   jack 
""
 
""
  exact   
""
  exactly  
 
""
 patrick   
""
""
uhm jack i think uh the record company we and we invest the
money to  to make a to make a artist the talents and they they invest
money to stereo and producers and a lot of things they must do
""
and uh promotions they we have  pay money to them   so
this 
 
""
 i i thought i see  
""
i mean that that in itself is a fair point and that may  that
may be applicable to  uh new record and artist that are just coming
""
but uh the other side to that coin is that there are thousand and
thousand the record from artists
""
uhm  let  ' s take the beatles for example   whose
record  have paid for themselves hundred of times over whose production
and cost have been subsidized hundred and thousand of time over
""
and therefore there is no  ne  necessary contribution to
fixed cost being taken from the sales of those new new records
""
and yet they  ' re still being produced still being sold  at the
same price  as those being sold for new artists  
""
is that fair  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 but if you if   you compare with the prices  uh
 uh  nowadays with the past five years we can see that the price are
going low 
""
but we can we can't  we can't do that is the england or or or
uk i mean the uk or usa  they haven't  lowers  their price  we
can't we can't do that first
 
""
right let  ' s ask leslie to join in conversation 
""
""
yes perhaps we have miss one uh very important point is about
the theme main theme of tonight is piracy in music
""
uh it is all evolved from copyright matters
""
say for selling of a record there  uh percentage of the money
uh received is going to the  uh record companies of course
""
another percentage to the artist another one to the music  cop
 uh writers
""
and for the pirated copies actually what they are doing is doing
using a cd to copy  hundred or thousands of copies without paying any
dollar of royalties of copyright loyal royalties
""
  so all the  all the music writers artists are not
giving their fair share
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 yes that  ' s right  
 
""
that well that that that that may well be a case in point
""
but nonetheless given the fact that uhm it  ' s a fairly well known
at the moment that cds can be produced for a fraction of the cost at which
they  ' re sold
""
i think uh  record companies will continue to have this
problem with piracy because the the public at large are not willing to accept
the company are suffering
""
the public at large are still perceive record companies are
making far too many profits at the expense of the the record buying public
  and  given the opportunity to buy a pirated cd they  ' ll probably
continue to do so 
 
""
 yeah  
""
right uh before you go jack i  ' d like to ask you a question
""
would you by any chance buy a pirated cd 
 
""
uh yes 
 
""
why 
 
""
uh well as i say because i think record companies  are guilty
of overcharging by to a gross extent   and while  i agree that one
should pay perhaps more for new artist
""
one should pay royalties to the artist whose songs are being
played
""
record companies are are by far and away uhm  the biggest
culprits  in this and  they put themselves in the position where the
public has no sympathy for them 
 
""
 i see  
""
i see well thank you very much for your call   jack 
 preciate  it thank you
""
let  ' s take a short break here and invite other callers at three
three three zero four four four
""
the number again is three three three zero four four four
""
welcome back to speaking of money i  ' m lorraine han
""
we  ' ve been talking about music piracy here in hong kong and with
me in the stereo is mr leslie ching licensing manager with cash which stands
for the composers  '  and authors  '  society of hong kong
""
we also have in the stereo patrick wong who  ' s the executive
secretary of ifpi hong kong which is the international federation of
phonographic industry
""
gentlemen let me come back and and ask you are there any uhm
organizations or people here in hong kong actually successfully prosecuted
leslie 
 
""
 thank you   
""
""
uh on what i  ' m working on on the performing side  uh lot
of say restaurants boutiques and karaoke bars have been prosecuted  
say  in  in in past years
 
""
 uhm  
""
so it  ' s only been in the past few years that actual action has
been taken 
""
""
no action has been taken all the time actually uh in every
year we take about hundred cases to court
 
""
wow 
""
""
yeah
 
""
it  ' s a lot
""
uhm so do you believe that legislation is the answer   
to the problem  
""
""
 not yet   not yet
""
there are lot of loop loop  hole  over there
 
""
yes like lowering your price as we have heard from a caller jack
earlier yes
""
uhm tell me patrick if a song is an old one  for example like
let say mozart beethoven
""
it  ' s been run it  ' s still on the on the shelves of a number of
of uhm  uhm shops
""
are they still protected 
""
""
uh according to the copyright act  uhm  the sound
recording is protected  when  after after the release date fifty years
""
after after the that that period  the songs uh will be come to
a public domain
""
everybody can use it   but they  but you still to pay a
 certain kind of royalty  to the companies which uh produce it
 
""
 i see  
""
uhm
""
leslie what about music videos
""
do they fall victim to piracy as well  or patrick should i say
""
""
either one of you i don't care 
""
""
yeah i think music video  will  they have pirates but
 not not much than cds because  mus  music video is  rather
complicated    
""
they cost a lot  and  cd i think is most convenient way to
to do the pirates because you just dub dubs to a dat  dat machine and go
to manufacturer the factories and copy copy duplicating many many copies
 
""
 uhm  
""
uh well i would have thought just duplicating uh music video on
vhs would have been same sort of thing 
""
not really 
""
""
not really
""
""
  so it  touched on a very interesting topic
that it heated up a few months ago
""
it  ' s about the blank tape levy   if if  you can 
re  still remember    it  is about home taping
""
so everybody get a cd or rent a cd and from shop and do a dubbing
at home and  rec   most  choose all the most favourite songs
""
this is all the home taping is illegal at this moment
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yes  
""
right you mean the combination of various hits 
""
""
uh no it  ' s the act of coping   it  ' s illegal
""
of  course many would say that it is only for private  use
 private use put it into  car  hifi  or whatever   but
 still it is illegal    
""
so the law reform commission just follow international trend
proposed a blank tape levy on  on the cassette cassette tapes
 
""
 oh i see right  
""
 uhm  
""
 oh  
""
uhm and when is this levy come into effect 
""
""
uh i just mention it  ' s still in consultative period and it  ' s
all up to the government to decide whether it will be legislated or not
 
""
uhm how much of a problem patrick is piracy of in china 
""
""
very serious
 
""
very serious uh you say with a smile though 
""
""
yeah but   chi chi  in in china the pirate 
response  major on the tax
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uh because cds not very popular in in china the penetration
of the cd players is not very  very good uhm
""
uhm but it  ' s still  very serious problem
""
be uh especially  a southern offshore area
 
""
like shenzhen that area 
""
""
yeah right   shenzhen  one-word  fu
 fukien  
""
""
 see one one interesting point  one-word
  
 
""
yeah 
""
""
areas where uh you can buy everywhere
 
""
right 
""
""
it  ' s one interesting point is the copyright law in china
just came up  this year   the  first ever one
 
""
 yes  
""
a few months ago   actually yes    and 
""
""
""
 yes july  
""
""
 i think   i think the may major major major
issues on  who who will be executed    where the  execute
the  the law   to   to to the area
 
""
 executed  
""
 right  
""
right sorry i thought you meant physically executed like in china
but anyway uhm we  ' ve just a few more minutes to go
""
gentlemen let me ask you uhm  what advice would you give
somebody  getting into into the industry and and uh what should somebody
should aware of and uh looking at uhm at uh pirated  soft music 
""
""
uh i my only advice is uh when you walk walk around walk
along the mong kok area just just be aware of the pirated cd
 
""
close your eyes and don't buy 
""
""
yes of course
 
""
leslie 
""
""
just one word is uh  apprec  uh to to appreciate the
work of the composers
 
""
right yes they do do a lot of hard work
""
  thank  you gentlemen very much    
  for coming  in
""
that  ' s mr leslie ching  licensing managing of the composers  '
and authors  '  society here in hong kong and mr patrick wong who  ' s executive
secretary with the international federation of phonographic industry i  ' ve
got that right
""
and uh we we  ' re speaking of money tonight
""
we also like to thank our caller jack who  share a lot of 
light  to the industry we thank him
""
and we take a break now for the news at the top of the hour do
stay with us because conversations follow next 
""
""
 yes  
""
 thank you  
""
""
 thank you   
""
""
""
i have some problem with that
""
i think he  ' s proposing to finance  infrastructural 
development with the issue of three year bonds
""
uh now i i i can't see how they can be done mean you you got short
term borrowing  to deal with a long term  development uh there  ' s going
to be mismatching   somewhere 
""
""
 but i   guess in the end there will be long term
bonds   issues
""
and  i  ' m in favour of using  uh government bonds to
finance long term projects for  vari  various reasons   as
""
""
""
 right okay  
""
 but   we can't because if you  one-word
 nineteen ninety seven then of course the prc government  ' s consent
would have to be given
""
""
but i guess that would be resolved at the liaison group level
because uh we must uh see the bonds are not just for the local population for
the local investors
""
it  ' s for international community
""
japanese will come the americans will come you know they are much
more bullish about the future of hong kong than us
