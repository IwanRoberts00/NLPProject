the international air transport association representing over
two hundred airlines is up in arms over having to pay for the new chek lap
kok airport before it ' s even opened
the airlines have been passing the extra costs to their passengers
iata is complaining about the so-called chek lap kok element that
has been added to charges for airlines using kai tak airport speech by
gunter eser director of i.a.t.a. 
and the airline customer will bear the brunt of it 
it was noted that landing charges for seven four seven aircraft
will be raised from nine thousand three hundred dollars in nineteen
eighty-nine to sixty thousand dollars when chek lap kok airport opens in
nineteen ninety-seven
 
every year the airlines make cost justification to the hong 
kong government for fare increase and the for last uh two three
years it ' s in the region of seven percent to ten percent
but with a sharp increase in land charges the percentage would
have to be raised 
in total the airlines will be paying over four billion dollars
from now to nineteen ninety-seven towards building chek lap kok airport
iata believes the amount could come instead from the more than ten
billion dollars to be collected from departure tax at kai tak in the same
period 
the airlines also think the government has underestimated the rate
of air traffic growth and that the new airport will actually be lucrative
without the excessive charges 
iata also suggested if money is that short the hong kong government
could borrow more money issue bonds or let the airlines take up equity 
beijing is already baulking at existing debt equity provisions but
iata is not about to get involved in that dispute speech by gunter eser
linus cheng admits all iata can do is to try to talk to the hong
kong government into letting the airlines off lightly 
legco ' s select committee studying the future electoral system has
submitted its report to the full council
the report suggests that the territory should be divided into nine
constituencies to elect twenty members to legco in nineteen ninety-five
each constituency will be allocated two directly elected seats but
two constituencies with bigger populations will each get three seats 
the report suggests that each voter should only be allowed to cast
one vote
the recommendation sparked a fierce debate among legislators
some members criticize the multi-seat single-vote system for
depriving the voters of their rightful choices 
others said the system would allow small political groups a chance
to compete for a seat in the council
legco will hold a motion debate on the issue next week
