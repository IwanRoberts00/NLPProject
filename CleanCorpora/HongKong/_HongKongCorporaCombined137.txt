  good evening and welcome to newsline chief executive tung chee wah has banned the falun gong movement as an evil cult is beijing putting pressure on the sar government to curb the group what should hong kong do with us to discuss these issues are dr raymond wu hong kong deputy to the national people ' s congress and mr martin lee chairman of the democratic party  uhm   gentlemen welcome martin you have said that the fulun gong uh issue is made a break for one county two systems why do you think is that serious  because this may be the first time since the year establishment of the sar that the central government and the hong kong government do not agree on the way that the fulun gong issue should be handled and so i i ' ve been calling them acid test for one country and two system   uhm  now up to now any senior government servant who spoke including uh mrs yip had had said that these people have not broken the law in hong kong   uhm uhm  now but if as a result of uh further pressure from beijing the hong kong government then begin to do something about these people whether to have them arrested or have the organization deregistered and so on then the whole world will know well this not quite one country two systems is it     uhm  raymond do you agree that the way china and hong kong handle this issue will determine whether hong kong actually enjoys uh a high degree of autonomy uh under one country two systems  i think i ' d like to respond to what martin has said one country two system will will will will not be so easy to break that the one word undergone a lot of tests and even   martin himself has said several times that the the the the one country two systems are breaking you see but i think uh th this issue the falun gong issue uh posts a a test onto the hong kong how to really to implement one country two system and then as far as so far i think uh uh uh disregarding all the words that might be harsh uhm i think every party is uh keeping one county two system well you see because nobody has ever utter anything that falun gong is illegal in hong kong    uhm  uhm  it ' s still keeping because hong kong we don't have a legal definition for cult you see uh what uh uh uh th the secretary bureau secretary uhm yip said or uh ms mrs sung said is just as a a a kind of uhm perhaps you can call it a warning that kind of thing   uhm uhm  really no action has been taken and even you look at the spokesman for central government all these people all their works are quite in line with what like one one country two system but anything if anything happen further which nobody would know   you see there are provisions in the basic law you see you can't you you you can't say that the the the uh implementation of some of the articles uh in the basic law means one country two system it ' s bro it ' s broken you see    uhm uhm   wh   but if if these people are not breaking the law why should they even be warned  uh why should you and i be warned if we ' re we ' re not breaking the law   why   why why why should you will be warned why should we be be warned you see  i think i think warning is is is good thing  one-word com  well you mean you ' d like to be warned everyday that you better be careful and so on   i don't mind well this this is a fun   i don't mind i don't mind this is a funny of enjoying your freedom i have to say  no     well uh if i may if if i may break in uh raymond i notice that you had a meeting with uh some falun gong people uh friday   i think i think we want  yes   and according to the newspapers uh saturday uh you had uh warned the falun gong people   not not warning uh just is a general warning     uh i ' m a few words all right all right you had said  i think i think we we ' ve been uh sort of our our  m our our minds that have been really too suspicious too too too sceptical everything sort of uh to the extreme i would say     you had said   uh   all right uh raymond uh uh according to the newspaper you had said that one country two systems would be undermined uh that that it could be undermined and it would be detrimental for hong kong could be undermined you see     uh huh yes now uh how would one country two systems be undermined  uhm i think if falun gong people try to push the test to the limit and try to test the limit uh of one country two system    uhm uhm  uhm uhm  you see uhm then i think there is a danger   but that ' s not undermining it that ' s just telling what the limits are well the limits are there aren't they   uhm  uh i think the limit is still not clear   uhm uhm  there ' s l a lot of room that ' s what i i what what what my what my opinion is that the article twenty three should be left until later date when the political environment is more harmonious the central government the hong kong relationship are are are better   uhm uhm  uh then i think it would be the time to uh legislate the article twenty three you see but if if that ' s has happened to push whichever party   uhm uhm  to take sort of to take action to implement certain legislation of the laws in order to keep law in order for hong kong as well as uh a uh uh as mainland china then that would be a threat   uh martin   do i do i understand correctly raymond are you saying that if the falun gong people if they keep on pushing uh their freedom to the limit that might antagonize the central government to such an  extent that it would   yes   yes   that might endanger the national  security   uh it would   uh  uh it was then   you see  it would then cause the hong kong government to enact a law  which is unduly harsh and and under article twenty three of the basic law  is thereby  yeah   yes   yah  thereby  thereby uh posing a a threat to one country two systems  it     uhm   it ' s not those things one country two it ' s to to indirectly if if if there is a a a a a a sort of dying need to to legislate article twenty three and article twenty three is so harsh that a lot of people in hong kong are uncomfortable then does it post a threat on  one country two system     uhm   well   now it seems to me seems to me that if   you see the logic   no no i i don't follow the logic  actually i i don't think faulun gong poses us a threat one country two systems  if if the central government exercises its restrains there is no threat   no you don't a few words     yeah  uhm    but if the central government allows the hong kong  sar government to do what it does un under the law   there ' s no threat   but   you can't ask two-words   frank frank i think i think uh to be the leader of a nation national security is the top priority   uhm uhm  you ask the american president   yes how if falun gong   they can do anything   yeah how how is   they can declare war   how is falun gong   they can kill   how is falun gong a threat to national security   thousands of people  yet to be seen   you better first say catholicism is a threat to national security could be   yet to be seen   it could be   raymond wu is a threat to national security  but that it ' s ridiculous   could be could be   could could be   why not   ray raymond surely that ' s a difference what the falun gong people or anybody does in china humiliating china and what they do in hong kong but what they do this exactly what i ' ve been sort of sharing my views with the falun gong people   uhm uhm  don't link up with china ' s falun gong people out of their control   aren't they a branch of the falun gong uh in in china  i don't know   uh huh i mean i i thought that they were there from the beginning   i don't know  i don't know  but imagine what ' s the purpose of falun gong it ' s for self-development    but you sound  uhm  why is there need to link up with everybody in the world  but wh  but why are they banned to begin with   i think in china  why that ' s why the one words    anything that you don't understand you think is unreasonable i think is too too too too uh but i i ' m asking   i i i think one one has to trust you see people have enough intelligence to make certain decisions oh i see you cant consider everybody to be stupid than more stupid than than you are you see   well that ' s i ' m i ' m you are not a legislator because you never take the government for granted you know because it ' s our job to supervise  you cannot assume that they had did the right thing    well   but but you are not a legislator for  for for for for the china is that right   but   but you are you are hong kong ' s deputy in the national people ' s congress and and that ' s why i would expect you on one hand maybe you can talk for   yes yes yeah of course   but before you know anything why do you you pass on such judgements but you tell me because you ' re a deputy   no because you ' ve already passed on judgement  that they did something wrong  they  no no they ban   that exactly the st   th they they banned the falun gong i ' m asking you  i i ' m sure they  i ' m sure they must have good reasons all right you tell me what the good reasons are i well i will find out but you don't even know how can you defend it well some of the thing might never know and you defend it no i ' m just saying it that there is room for doubt that ' s all i ' m not defending it  i ' m just uh keeping an open mind a benefit of doubt    okay  then what do you do with d deputy  and you don't pass on any judgement   uh sorry   until you know all the facts    ray  so raymond you are saying you ' re giving the falunn gong the benefit of a doubt  those are all are all parties    uhm ma   he ' s giving the central government the   so do you mean   including you martin   okay so   i give to ma martin the benefit of doubt that why he made such ration uh uh irrational   judgements is it     uhm   uh so uh ray raymond uh am i right in understanding you   i think you are the fellow who needs a benefit of doubt more than anybody else     well okay but does that mean you give falun gong a benefit of doubt  they may not be an evil cult  it may not be a threat to national security   yes   yes   yes i i i yes   uh huh   and yet they will be banned as i said they might have good reasons   uhm a laughs     okay   how do you know    all right uh now raymond you met of them uh friday what is your impression of them  the the number of people that i met uh seem to be uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a genuine believer who has solved their own high uh uh uh sort of aspirations and ideals and so on okay  but as i said it doesn't mean that if they are the proper ones    uhm uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm uhm  every falun gong p gong practitioner is a proper one  you see     uhm  yes  some uh my my words my view is that be careful not to be utilised by people with ulterior motive   uh who are these people  i don't know how do i know   huh uh  everybody have to be in their life have to be be be be cautious about that     yes okay so that ' s a general principle that   everyone should observe   general principle everyone should observe     i mean you and martin and myself we should all be careful and not be utilised   yah yah that ' s right  that ' s right that ' s right     okay  now  especially people   but is there any evidence that they ' ve been been that they ' ve been utilised i mean that you know of how would i be able to know all the evidence  i ' m not a a a a a private eye  oh i see  i agree with you and that that is why i find it rather odd  if   but before if you don't have the evidence then you just tell these people giving your heartfelt advice no doubt that they must careful not to be utilised when no evidence that they have been utilised   yes exactly no evidence well they would doubt oh i see they would know     uhm  okay well this is very interesting   they should be one word i love to know     we ' ll we ' ll have to continue this this discussion after the break don't go away we ' ll be right back a break    welcome back we ' re discussing the falun gong movement in hong kong now raymond uh as you know the national people ' s congress will be meeting next month in beijing   yes  yes   and you ' ll be attending  yes   uh will you or other hong kong deputies bring up the falun gong issue  i don't know   you you have no intention to do that   i personally have no intention but i ' ll i ' ll participate in the discussion   uh huh   i think falun gong to my mind is as i said is a good test for one country two system   uhm  and it could demonstrate that provided that there are few provisions that must make that falun gong in hong kong just practice falun gong   uhm  without trying to attempt as i have sort of uh uh uh uh reminder you see   uhm uhm  because once of course they have their their their their objective you see uh uh of doing all this protest and so on you see but the reality is that once falun gong has been as you ' ve said banned by the central government as cult    uhm  uhm uhm  that not mr tung chee wah   right  in fact mr tung chee wah never try to ban you see he has just uh make a statement of his personally views like that you see uh then it would be difficult to revert   now uh what i know   so i think it it will take time but will you at least   for for falun gong people to just sort of uh uh uh through their actions and so on   yeah but   would would you at least tell uh the officials in beijing that the falun gong people in hong kong in spite of what they have been doing uh in spite of the fact that not everybody agree  with you   they have not broken the law my dear fellow   martin   martin   martin   you know martin i think i think you ' ve been uh simple and naïve okay what ' s wrong i think before they made such a decision  one-word as uh banning falun gong as a cult    uhm   uhm  but but in mainland china   i know we of course mainland china   you know how how our uh what sort of process they have gone through i ' m talking about falun gong in hong kong falun gong hong kong they have left for hong kong do we need to to to tell them no no no but i think you should   but they have never banned hong kong falun gong to be cult no no but i think you should tell them that th that these people in hong kong they have not broken the law  they don't need need to tell  they know it oh i see of course they know from the spokesman ' s words they never said falun gong has broken the law perhaps you ' ve reacted overreacted to to that all right then perhaps you will tell them they don't have to worry about falun gong in hong kong of course they worry why   uh let me get back to the npc uh meeting next month uh you one of your associate uh jàng hin jí tsang hin chi, hong kong deputy to the national people ' s congress uh i think has uh said that he will uh bring this up now is that of appropriate for the npc to discuss hong kong interest   why not  why not   why not uh you remember that in nineteen ninety eight uh president jiang zemin had said that hong kong members of the npc should not intervene in hong kong uh government affairs  as a npc body but as an individual  he will encourage us    yeah   no uh  no no i ' m sorry he was after the individuals   to involve in the hong kong hong kong  matters    no uh president jaing zemin   and then one word  also     i was talking about hong kong members   uh mr jiang as npc uh uh uh uh uh member i think at least you should given him the freedom the right to speak on whatever issues   yes and he said that you should not interfere  speaking is it is is speaking uh interfering i think again you have sort of try to this kind of views has been expressed so so often   uhm  which i think we all reject that we are prohibited from even speaking anything of hong kong matters   uhm i see so you you think uh   i think that that is not uh being accepted   by by the     what what would constitute interference if not speaking   judg judging from mr jiang zemin ' s point of view i mean he knows that the the deputies from hong kong will only go to beijing and speak two-words the meetings    uhm  yes how how can they physically interfere with hong kong ' s affairs yes exactly   other members are speaking  so i i so i yeah therefore     uhm   yes exactly exactly   would you then call it interference no therefore when when president jiang uh asked the hong kong deputies not to interfere in hong kong affairs presumably   would would that contravene sort of uh freedom of speech it would i i think you would better ask president jiang i didn't ask you stop i want you to to defence freedoms in hong kong you see obviously i think even on the right side of lee these two people are are are different in views    uhm  well i i i assume   of course i know there are a lot of people who want us to to keep quite or to remain silent but that that is that should not be the case you see    uhm uhm  i see
