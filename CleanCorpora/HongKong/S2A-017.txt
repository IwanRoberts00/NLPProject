jet air getting the upper hand inside the final one hundred and he
races away

prize

and he  ' s just about at the two hundred metre pole and he has
broken down 
""
the winner is number seven jet air 
""
ridden by louis corrales and he  ' s taken the prize and he  ' s won in
pretty good style 
""
getting nicely clear of danzig hero and mr dragon best of the rest
""
""
so it  ' s seven one and nine 
""
seven one and nine 
""

breed gelding he  ' s by bo genius from dame imperial louis corrales riding for

""
""
and officially fourth hong kong buzz andy tsang for louis ho 
""
so it  ' s seven one nine and two after the running of race number
two 
""
hong kong buzz well he dropped out to the tail of the field which
is customary for him 
""
did tack on coming down the side and looked like he was going to
play some part but he didn't finish the race off like wise happy win 
""
and he tacked on 
""
probably six hundred out started to circle the field but he  ' s just
battled in the straight 
""
seven one nine and two here  ' s steve with the dividends 
""
""
good win there jet air good ride also by louis corrales ah you
wouldn't have thought he would have lead in the race but anyway that was the
case of those horses on the speed dominating the race and jet air gets the
prize tony wong and louis corrales 
""

""
""
ah welcome back live to taipo racecourse that  ' s louis

""
quinella two hundred and twenty dollars fifty 
""
the tierce three thousand two hundred and seventy five 
""
one and a half lengths by four and three quarters 
""
one forty three point five is the run time 
""
as we have a look at the head on replay and as you can see ah lucky
kingdom breaking down towards the back of the field but ah once again those
that raced on the speed were pretty much to the fore 
""
danzig hero was given a nice ride ah but eventually ah jet air who
had the sit behind him ah comes with the ah run 
""
and he  ' s actually scored very easily ah danzig hero holds on for
second a long back uh break back to the rest 
""
of course eventually holding that was mr dragon same run pattern
for hong kong buzz gets a mile back flashes home late but fourth place for
him again tonight 
""
""
yeah he ah hasn't really run on that well i would have
expected a bit more of a stronger finish for him the way that he tacked on so
""
""
for my mind rather than flashing in he  ' s just whacked away so he  ' s
been pretty disappointing considering it  ' s not much of a class five race 
""
but all honours with the winner jet air that  ' s him sneaking across
quickly from a wide alley and he had enough speed to get across sit outside
this leading pair 
""
then he took a sit and just sat back off them as they went into the
back we  ' ve got cheung on glory showing good speed joined by danzig hero 
""
jet air in third 
""
lucky king in the gray with a nice spot in fourth to his outside
was dare 
""
now  the rest of em quite back midfield was enemy he was one of
the sources of speed we  ' d thought he  ' d show speed but he was ridden back
off the speed today but it hasn't made any difference 
""
has failed to stay the trip 
""
a good space back then to the rest and we have mr dragon miracle
midnite mouse king was 
""
midfield and the tail enders were of of course hong kong buzz and
happy win 
""
and strung out over about fifteen lengths as they went towards the
eight hundred 
""
danzig hero just booting up on the inside of and going to take the
lead away from cheung on glory 
""
lucky kingdom travelled nicely and uh it looked like he was going
to play some part but unfortunately he  ' s broken down and to his outside the
eventual winner jet air 
""
always travelled nicely 
""
louis corrales just going forwards three deep now to put a bit more
pressure on these leaders 
""
dare the other gray sneaking into the race 
""
you can see lucky kingdom going backwards quickly there and going
by of him was happy win ahh the pink cap midnite mouse king again he  ' s just
plodded and there  ' s hong kong buzz right around the outside and normally you
see him finish his races off a little better than this but he  ' s just whacked
away 
""
in front danzig hero but popped the question jet air 
""
straight on  live  in for louis corrales 
""
and he got away and scored nicely a length and a half danzig hero
""
""
mr dragon  ' s whacked away okay for third 
""
not much we can really say about the rest steve 
""
""
i think it  ' s a case with hong kong buzz ah on the turf he he
can be making up ground but he is still a maiden on the sand and 
""
it  ' s just so hard to pick up and make ground from back in the
field 
""
and they didn't go as really as hard as what we  ' d think in the
race 
""
the key place dividends for the second one and seven eighty five
dollars 
""
seven and nine seventy eight fifty and one and nine fifty eight
dollars 
""
look away from your screen if you don't want to know the result of
race one the replay will come your way in around ten minutes 
""
that returned one thousand four hundred and twenty five fifty 
""
consolation fifty six dollars 
""
shortly have a look at the track work here it is on screen now for
the next event race three the murwillumbah handicap class six gallopers one
thousand metres please take note nathan day rides number four no money no
honey 
""
the early favourite is number three super treasure 
""
first up for the season but consistent in class six on the sand
first time out for michael kent 
""
rich in wealth is number five robbie burke and tony wong a thirty
to one chance in the early markets 
""
new hero yu tai lam and da silva combining 
""
he  ' s ah well found tonight eighty one dollars 
""
form of late though has been a mixed bag 
""
tony wong prepares this horse golden apple is actually a big price
ah earlier on but well that money sees him shortened down to fourteen to one
but he was a silly a silly uh quote 
""
uh earlier on this evening forex supreme is number nine louis ho
and sammy cheng thirty to one for him 
""
and the last horse we  ' ll take a look at is number eleven richness
for alan leung and louis corrales 
""
second favourite seven to two in fact thirty seven fifty the exact
quote for him 
""
nine minutes away from ah starting race three but first of all it  ' s
a very good evening to franko lau 
""
""
good evening steve and ah let  ' s first take a look at ah
number seven new hero last time was second 
""
over the thousand and fifty event and ah was beaten by less than
two so on that score he should run a good race over the one thousand metre
trip but the only concern for him 
""
is he is drawn wide barrier twelve and i think he will very he will
find it very awkward out wide there and ah so i only give him a place chance
this evening 
""
""
yeah he  ' s one of those horses franko barrier twelve  ' s a
worry i think he  ' s under odds for the race he  ' s had plenty of racing this
season 
""
ah new hero was in fact the winner of the first race of the current
season failed over thirteen hundred two starts back when ah finished at the
tail of the field and back to form last time over a thousand and fifty when
raced on the speed 
""
ah chance at his best but can mix his form and i wouldn't think he  ' s
an eight to one chance in the race 
""
i  ' d ah expect him just to be a bigger price than that he has had
had a lot of racing which worries me 
""
happy horse is over the odds class six is his mark 
""
ah didn't have much luck last time he missed the kick rather badly
i think back to this grade does look like an obvious improver i  ' m surprised
he  ' s is going out at thirty five to one 
""
k s lee ah rides these front runners pretty well and 
""
happy horse speedy and weak but that  ' s good enough for class six
""
""
""
well last run he didn't really behave as well inside the
barrier he was very fractious in there and uh reared and he was travelling
pretty wild throughout the run 
""
so obviously that  ' s ruined his chances and in this one barrier
six a much better barrier draw for him 
""
and he has speed and 
""
can be  relied upon  and coming back to a similar weight
which he had 
""
ah three starts back when he won over one thousand and fifty so ah
i thought ah he  ' s a chance in this race and also the value too at thirty
five to one 
""
""
catch up with our preview number eight golden apple put
together two good wins at the start of the season but gee he  ' s mixed his
form since and i don't think his past couple have been too flash 
""
ah i  ' d say that  ' s about his quote for me around fifteen to one
