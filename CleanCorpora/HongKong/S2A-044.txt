okay don't worry 
now one of the two thing i would like to tell you is
 environmentally speaking two thing important one was the
outbreak of fire and the second was flooding 
i think these two remain haz hazards or dangers for
traditional china and they cause a lot of environmental problems 
fire and trouble 
but there were forest fires 
uh forest fires in china were not as serious as those in the
west as we found them but there were still because it it was limited
usually to the places where people went to the grave graveyard uh
that ' s the same todays when people have to burn their
 papers their incents they left some fire
so a lot of fires were were were were were were were seen or
or broke out at the hills and mountains where people went to uh
to sweep their homes
that is true but it was limited to certain area 
uh fires in the forest people ignore i ' m sure about that
 but we don't have big fires reported
but fire within the cities were more important because 
there were too many people there 
now uh for example in uh particular in uh in a prosperous
city like hangzhou uh in in main in in in the central uh 
one word we found that that fire hazard or so important
so serious that they broke out practically every day because the
streets were narrow most of the uh buildings were made of wood in
the south central made of wood in the north made of bricks 
usually okay usually ask official opinion
and how do they how do they safeguard fires i
have to declaim
the the way to do it was to uh i have in each of the city there
were about several hundred soldiers whose task it was to prevent 
fire
and there were towers built up very high higher than
all the buildings and up there there ' ll there ' ll there ' ll there ' ll
there will be one or two sentry 
downstairs there several-words in the daytime
when there was a fire somewhere in the north they would raise their flag
 to the north
and then people who look at your flag will know ah there is a fire
there
and then down there will be people with buckets not people
soldiers
water bucket water hoses uh and also ropes and also
axes uh for breaking into the 1-word houses
there are lot of 1-word there ' s a once 
they knew that there was a fire these people would look at them 
and went to that particular place or building to prevent the fire
from spreading
i don't know in the s in in the win in in the
dark say at night they will use lanterns 
the same the lantern when it point to the north it means
fire in the north etcetera 
but still using buckets i mean sometimes you cannot
 h help to to extin extinguish the fires which
 several-words other uh big cities
the way to do it was to build artificial channels uh uh ta
 channels that is to say an artificial waterway was built 
particularly for the sake of uh putting all the valuable things in
the centre
so most rich people will build their godowns inside that 
artificial uh uh uh waterway
so whenever there was a fire people would go oh we got
 water there then use the water to to to to to extinguish the fire
but it was very expensive 
so there were many many other ways to prevent fire i only one
 two words 
but another most important hazard was flooding 
now flooding was even more serious than fire because it it
had uh it more harm it destroy more homes 
but the attention was usually to the yellow river because it
was where the capital and most important uh cities were situated
so the chinese were very much concerned with how to control
flood and the changing of the yellow river course but not those in
the yansi or the pearl river
and that is the reason why in in the present day we
need to do a lot on the yansi river but not in the yellow river because
the yellow river had been the attention of governments for a long
time
they ignore the yansi 
they ignore the pearl river okay 
so far i can't go to the detail but all i want to say to you
was so far the way to prevent flooding was to enraise 
the embankment
so once you see the water level has reached very high then
people uh will be asked or forced to build embankment higher
embankment 
so we will find that as time went on when embankment was very
high but still there were flooding
only until the seventeenth century uhm the kinsu emperor uh
 two-words 
i try my best to to be quick but i think i ' m trying my
 two words i got some several words
now the kinsu emperor was taught or arc by the
jesuits the missionaries to have the technique of 
deepering the river bed 
instead of enraising the embankment the 
the the the the work was to was to deepen the river bed so so that
 so it was a very effective way of preventing flood
that was in the seventeenth century 
kinsu was helped because formerly people did not how to go
down the river and do work there
but that was the the technique was taught by the jesuit
fathers when they came to china in the eighteenth century
kinsu was one of the most enlightened of the 
several-words enlightened emperor in china who would accept
western techniques would several-words 
i would love to talk about it and this is urban planning
i can say more about it
but what i ' m trying to tell you is that the two hazards
 were there you can ask me question afterwards i think but i
think most important point as i would like to say to you the what we
call personal hygienes
environmental situation was closely involved with personal
hygienes
for example the spread of diseases would be important if
 there were a lot of germs
what about bathing washing one ' s body 
now i cough not work on that i can't go into
detail but i would like to tell you that in even in the sixth and
seventh century sixth and seventh centuries uh in central china
there were public and private baths 
people went to to to to wash their bodies in the public
bath say uh once two times in uh uh one in two days ' time
 okay
so a lot of people 3-words importance of
bathing and even there was hot water bath for the westerners 
the chinese had no war warm water
 war war war warm water had to be boiled
you know so it was very difficult only for the for the foreigners 
they were treated with warm water
and but in the north bathing was quite a rare thing
because the weather was cold and there was less of uh rivers and all that
apart from washing brushing the teeth now the chinese for
information were the first people for most at least as far as i can
see who knew how to brush their teeth 
 twelfth century we brush our teeth or with
vegetables with grass and all that 
uh the the westerner did not know how to brush their teeth until
the eighteenth and nineteenth century
 that is true 
so there were a lot of things were not found in the in 
needham ' s work for example this but which i think would be find
in in narratives biographies in all this so different 
things you know
okay so most important i think for personal hygiene was 
how to dispose the waste or i don't know whether you agree with me
i went to edinburgh uh uh to manchester and then discover that
there there was a museum on subter rran rran 
subter subterran subterranean museum that is to say 
to tell you the origin and history of waste disposal in england from
 the time immemorial right up to the present time 
i spend at least half a day there 
so they they give you all the drawings the reason why and
to be honest the original one you got all the water sound there and only
to sit there and and try
the same as what we are exactly di different that is
 several words like this a square one
so the uh the chinese we got a bucket the mah tung
 chinese style toilet 
so they they they use a square thing but the same people
would come up here and take away the waste the same as the chinese
what ' s of difference 
the difference is that the chinese continued to use a buck
 the mah tung well until the twentieth century
even when i was small i have to use a mah tung 
before the water toilet was uh was uh implemented
i don't know whether you have used it
ask your father
ask your grandfather
they will know it
but for the west it was different because of the reason why
they are different they are different because the chinese did continue to
be agricultural until the twentieth century
and the so-called waste was used as a fertilizer 
people come into your place to buy it 
i don't know whether you agree with
they they said oh are you got one word 
i i would like to buy your waste you know
so that was the case in the countryside 
but in the west because of industrial revolution say in the
nineteenth century agriculture had no longer been important
so there are many other reason the invention of uh chlorine and all
this so and all the how to uh neutralize the the the waste
but neutralizing the waste means it was not could not be
used for fertilizer anymore
so i can't go into detail but it was very interesting for
example when we go to the tower bridge in england there was a
space below the window there was all no everywhere was clean
 f fertile with flowers and that little part was always
 going to die
i i saw it there was no grass there no one word
 weeds and then the guide westerner told me that it was
a place where waste was disposed 
so i said how why and then he then he brought us right
up to the to the high up to the tower and there we found a toilet
a real the toilet i saw in manchester there you got a hole
there the royal big person queen king or princess or
prince just did their they they had they had a toilet there 
and the and all the waste would come down to that particular s place
really i mean i ' m not telling this 
i mean i just got all the information a few few i mean a few
months ago when i was in in england 
so i found that that traditional china traditional 
europe were more or less the same excepted that of course the west
improve very quickly 
the chinese remain agricultural
but basically the waste wasn't that bad
it wasn't the it wasn't the agent or tran transmitting
for for uh for for uh uh for the disease transmission no 
the main difficulty i think was rats in traditional
china as well as in uh in in in in the west
but there was no black death in china 
there were a lot of uhm a lot of uh lo localized
poisoning localized uh plague you know many particularly in hong kong 
the two 
i just try to advertise myself a bit here
uh this is the book i uh i translate called the water for
a barren rock
this is the history of uh uh water in in in hong kong
so water uh that that is a quite i i i i did a lot of research but
i i ' m the one who translated the book from the chinese into english
now this book shows you one thing that is to say because of
the shortage of water good water there were plagues in hong kong and
people thought that it was rat and all that but the actual reason we can
report one thing we should several words tape change
to side b were the only source of containing or the or retaining
water for the common people 
now wells in china of course i talk a lot of wells here 
here of course they were regarded as being poisonous many of them
but in traditional china wells was suppose to be w e l l s 
wells was supposed to be clean and you dug a well good
enough wells then the situation will be okay 
so we have to go into wells again 
uh i got a book too on the rats and everything living on this
land and to us rats are not that bad you know 
uhm you can you you say the rats as being the as being
the uh clever but they were not poisonous and uh i show you
some of the rats here i i just i want to show you some of the pictures
of the rats here 
 one word how i i i pass it round so that
you can have a look at the uh uh two of you
just have a look okay
uh now now i would like to end the whole thing here
because several words too much to say
that is too say why did all these so uh traditional
things come into a head by the time china enter the
twentieth century 
now when i went to uhm beijing in nineteen ninety-one i i
went up to the great wall cheuhng cheuhng sihng 
i saw good scenary there big construction 
i was impressed
but when i look down on the hill i found so much waste
there a lot of waste paper a lot of disposal dumping
people just dump things onto the hills
so look up you see big thing look down you see all the waste
that was nineteen ninety-two
and there i also took the railway and uh it was a funny way
 several-words one with glasses big bun and you
could boil a kettle there you need a one word boil
water there and then and drink the water you cook your own water inside
the room
but then one thing
that was good
now one thing impress me was that the people also took 
chicken wings chicken legs whatever
once they finish it they just open the window and throw it
away just like that
and that was nineteen ninety-one
