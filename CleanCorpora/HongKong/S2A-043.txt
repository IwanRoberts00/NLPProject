the the topic itself is on housing strategies for temporary
workers in guangzhou  which is a  project which we conduct two years
ago  uh for a grant from this university in conjunction with uh colleagues
from baptist university and chungsaan university
""
uh what we are interested in primarily is to look into the 
spatial distribution of the temporary workers  uh in guangzhou  and
then uh try to look into the uh policy response from the municipal
authorities  with regards to  this uh ever-increasing group of uh
people dwelling in the city itself
""
but uh  as we move along you  ' ll probably realize that  i 
not only focusing on the empirical  investigation into the distribution
into the background of the temporary workers  but more important i also
try to throw some  theoretical construct around the issue itself 
""
so the  menu for this afternoon if i may put it this way  is
to look into initially about these uh  different perspectives in terms of
uh economic development  uh and its relations with migration 
""
and then i  ' m going to report a bit on the survey that we have
conduct uh towards the end of nineteen ninety-nine and then early year two
thousand  with regards to the temporary workers 
""
and then i will look into these uh so-called dualities of the
housing production system 
""
and then apologies to   manuel castell  i  con  use
his term and twist a little bit by talking about this  the space of flow
and places  which are the maxim of this uh so-called postmodernist uh
investigation
""
and to look into this uh global local housing  prod 
production dynamics to conclude  which hopefully will  have some  uh
 rejoinder  towards the initial discussions about the theoretical
construct 
""
on the notion of uh this development and migration  obviously 
uh there are quite a lot of uh theoretical  uh perspective that is
introduced  likely to come up  in in the literature
""
very briefly we probably start with  uh the so-call classical
model of the uh  one word  stages of economic growth and
development which i  ' m sure you know people around the room are quite well
versed with 
""
and as we move along we  look into this  uh so-call
neoclassical dynamics by  uh  name  for instance  in
his work looking into economic development  and the  uh supply of
service labour 
""
all these  constructs would be  a more or less a well
defined framework  uh of  demand and supply of the uh interactive
efforts of uh economics 
""
uh as we move along and then as the literature of uh the studies
gradually informed  the notion of migration begins to come into the
picture 
""
there is no longer a static model  as has been presented earlier
on  but then the dynamics between various bosses and various actors in the
old process of uh movement of  mobi  mobility of the people begins to
come to the uh  brand of uh investigation
""
so  say for instance we have this uh model for uh migration 
in terms of this rural and urban dynamics  uh and  of course you know a
very classical  uh model introduce by  dudaro  which  almost
appears to be a standard text for students of economics around the eighties
 uh in terms of this uh  urban and rural migration 
""
then  set the scene or set the backdrop in terms of the
development 
""
and then uh  starting from the seventies  increasing
literature in particular those sponsored by the world bank and uh  the imf
 multi national corporations and the like  begins to look into the
issue say for instance like urban buyers  so a classic from uh emerging
from those period  that  ' s a  work by  michael luctent  entitle
why people stay poor
""
the  study of these urban buyers in the world in world
development  which again you know is is a very important  uh study 
focusing on on the development in particular in india
""
why is it the case that despite the continuous effort in terms of
 uh economic development that  significant amount of people within
the indian subcontinent is not able to uh  move away their vicious cycle
so to speak of uh downward spiral in terms of uh development  class system
one of the issues that has been highlighted  and other related to them
""
""
as we move away from this uh classical and neoclassical tradition
into this uh modernist tradition  we begins to look into not purely the
 model  in terms of uh economic development or migration but we are
also interested to look into the process of the changes and transformation
""
among other literatures we have uh  suzanne sasan  uh talk
about this uh  1-word  cities published in nineteen
ninety-one  uh which focusing on the mobility as well as the agglomeration
of the mobility of labour  with particular reference to the market
formation
""
and then more recently the trilogy by  manuel castell  
the rise of the network society in information society and then the end of
the millennium  uh the the power of their identity 
""
uh this trilogy is extremely influential
""
and then uh last but not the least we have uh towards the latter
parts of the last millennium we have work by uh peter dicken  uh entitle
global shift which now move into his uh fourth edition
""
i think he  make  a good fortune out of this  uh standard
text uh   whi  which is extremely important in  informing our
understanding  of uh the dynamics between economic development and then of
uh population mobility 
""
another stream of uh investigation which is gaining currency  in
the last uh  twenty years obviously in north america  and more recently
in this part of the world  is to look into this so-call participatory
perspective
""
now here i try to  highlight some of the  issues in terms of
participation which affect and influencing the process of uh development
""
uh we we have in this case uh as early as nineteen fifty-eight 
uh the washington square in new york city basically tried to  demonstrate
the participation or the involvement of the people
""
i i think back then we don't have the  issu  the the notion
of stake holders but the people  which stood together to against uh the
construction of the boulevard across the washington square and then they
succeeded in doing so
""
uh moving into the eighties we have the work by newsmith for
instance  looking into the issues of uh urban renewal or subsequently that  ' s
 uh be uh very uh at so uh uh uh uh catchphrase terms as a gentrification
""
so the issues here look into the philadelphia  uh development of
society hill  where people argued that it  ' s basically an effort of  a
concerted effort uh to move  the lower class people from the city centre
 where by places being  deemed  regard to have very strong
potential values of development  that there is one of this uh classic
example  we  well reported in the work by newsmith again
""
there are other campaign and activities like the  tilo  this
is uh  this land is ours  looking into the uh collective effort by
people  in the borough of wandsworth which is the south bank of london 
uh in nineteen ninety-nine  against the decision of uh the development by
guinness corporation  whi  which is a a brewery from uh ireland  in
in terms of the the development
""
we also have uh the nimby situation
""
 thi  this is not  the first time nimby crop up in the
literature the so-call not in my backyard  uh syndrome
""
but more recently we have this uh donald trump who tried to build a
 commercial residential  one word  uh  architecture
 one word  argue  on the first avenue of uh manhattan
 which again receive tremendous uh uh  petition against the
development  but unfortunately uh the they they fail to uh win the game
and and then i think uh the construction is now ongoing this uh eight eight
ninety stories eight hundred foot uh tall  building will  pro 
probably be in another three years  '  time   still  side by side
will be united nations uh headquarters uh along the first avenue 
""
the  the other issue is uh uh i  ' m sure you know  other thing
can  1-word  me on on on on the pronunciation of this 
which basically is is is is a uh medieval practice of uh collecting essay
from the students
""
so so so that the person or uh uh uh  messenger perhaps you
know will move around and collect essays uh for for for particular uh topic
 so uh  few words   speech-by-audience-member 
""
thanks
""
that that that  ' s exactly
""
i i  ' m sure you know when you introduce this uh for the premier
exercises you have in the for for for the year one students  laughs 
""
but so  in in in effect it is a brain storming 
several-words   uh in terms of uh the development process
""
so  we we are  m  moving from the conventional wisdom
that uh things can be engineered within a laboratory or within an office 
to a situations which investigate into the process  uh as most of these
postmodernist works are focusing on  and then uh at the same time in
conjunction to this development about this participation  so so so that
the stake holders  the citizens  in  are involve  in in in in in
the ideas and shaping  the things to come 
""
we talk about participatory  naturally you know  we we have
this dialectic and then uh dialectical process there is also this
anti-participatory uh perspective
""
uh like for instance uh the  several-words 
episode of nineteen ninety-one again you know in  contrast with the uh
 one word  success of the society hill  ' s experience 
uh this this is a failure where the forces of the law  uh the the police
has  are being  drag in to uh evacuate  uh people who occupy again
you know a plant site in rural cities which deemed to have potential for
development
""
again in uh work by newsmith uh also comment on this leading to uh
the ideas about re-gentrification or de-gentrifications
""
the other one is uh the slap  which  uh is acronym for the
strategic lawsuit against public participation  uh  whi  which is
in in effect uh the response to the uh wandsworth episode i mention a moment
ago  in in terms of the uh guinness uh  uh corporation in terms of the
development in london
""
it it is trying to issue the lawsuit by the authority  to uh
forbidden  various kind of  part  participation which may  deem
to be uh an extent in the ways of uh the development 
""
then of course you know we have  three words 
talk about this uh  uh ideas about development from above and below 
which is a top down and then a bottom up uh interpretations
""
well all all all all these are very very brief uh  survey of uh
relevant studies or or discussion in terms of the development in  foc 
uh in particular reference to migratory  uh issues
""
in in the case of china  i  will say you know until very
recently the last ten fifteen years increasing  uh chinese colleagues or
ethnic chinese colleagues are working  uh research work in china  uh
which is enabling a a very very  healthy uh development in terms of the
the literature
""
uh in essence we are talking about a cyclical movement or uh argue
this uh circuit of the consumption production and market-oriented uh urban
development strategies  from the early days of the socialist development
 try to transform  cities  of  consumptive  lit  nature
into productive cities
""
and and then uh  in the post-marx development in the  chinese
 area  uh we try to look into this uh market element  in  into
the uh development  uh process within the urban domain
""
so early works by uh  laurie meyer  and alan noble 
 name  christopher howe  demonstrate the work uh 
tho  majority of those are from uh north america  al  although
christopher howe is from uh soas london
""
and then more recently as i argue work by kam ming chen  uh
deborah davis  uh  name   uh cindy fin  george
 uh uh professor  yeah   and woo fu lung  and
and andrew walter  all contribute to  uh enhance our understanding in
terms of the  uh urban research in china  and  one way or the other
they are related uh to the uh notion of uh  population dynamics in terms
of uh land use or changes
""
so then that is the so so-call the theoretical construct or the
intellectual backdrop leading to the  uh investigations
""
now what what is a village in cities 
""
we we are aware of this uh the increasing floating population
moving into this uh big metropolis in in in in in china   whi 
which is just a very natural process  which has be uh prophesied by many
you know in particular in the classical as well as in uh neoclassical
economic models 
""
what what i  ' m interested in is to look into the enclaves  which
is located  within the urban domain itself  but  at the same time
within this uh so-call rural administrative structure 
""
which puts  in both in terms of the land use  struc 
system as well as the development potential  in a very very 
predicament  situations 
""
as of year two thousand there are  uh one hundred and
thirty-nine of these enclaves  identified uh in within the  remit 
of uh guangzhou city itself
""
in particular  uh located in area like uh tianhe haizu and
baiyun districts  which formerly is being regarded as the uh rural 
county district and  s   due to administrative transformation and
 one word  of uh the city boundary has been incorporated
into as a so-call core area of a the city itself 
""
the  temporary population in guangzhou has increased
significantly from nought point  nought point three million  uh in the
early days of the open policy  to one point seven million as of uh
nineteen ninety-seven 
""
uh so the latter figures demonstrate a temporary population ratio
to the permanent population ratio of forty-three to one thousand
""
now i  i i i i  ' m sure you know colleagues around the room will
agree to the fact that it will be extremely difficult to say what exactly are
the amount of uh floating populations uh we we have in any particular cities
in china
""
uh the figures we have here we quote from the statistical year
books uh from china  as of some of the  uh subsequent data  which
will be   whi  which which we are going to uh visit  uh all
relied on those data
""
so uh i i welcome discussions  a  about the reliability of
this you know but for the time being  we will just uh take  uh the
official data uh as granted 
""
well that is the backdrop we kick off with the survey  uh
initially with archive research in terms of the theoretical construct  and
then we drum up a questionnaire design  uh we have a pilot test uh and
then we launch a more massive uh more large scale uh questionnaires uh survey
up to uh four hundred  plus
""
and then uh of that uh questionnaire return we  ' re going to have
about  uh hundred in that for case studies
""
we have face to face interviews and discussion with the people 
uh hope  with a will to bring in more information about this uh village in
the city
""
so before i move onto report on the findings, i  would just like
to mention that  what we are  tal  going to talk about is not 
a full representation of the floating population that have uh has been
identified in uh guangzhou towards the end of uh the last millennium
""
what i  ' m interested in  uh in this research is to look into the
people  who dwell in this so-call  uh village in the cities  this
enclave within the main urban area
""
all right so the  figures  probably we are talking about
close  to one million people 
""
right  so this is a  map  showing the  spatial
expansion of uh the guangzhou city itself
""
uh  it doesn't stand out quite well from from the map but uh
""
""
in in brief we are talking about this uh city centre  and then
 o  over the years with gradual expansion  towards the lower 
ridge  of the uh pearl river to the east  and and then uh more
recently uh to the north across the baiyuen  uh mountain range  and
then to the south across the river  to this uh haiju and fongjun area
