the topic of a complete smoking ban in restaurants bars
karaokes and night clubs is a controversial issue and people are getting more
and more emotional towards it
""
every time the subject was being raised no matter by anyone people
became tense confrontational irrational and thus start communicating in
different wave-lengths
""
no discussions and communications can therefore be carried out
""
is this a sensible way to handle such a debatable issue
""
the catering industry supports neither smoking nor second hand
smoking
""
we understand and accept that many people have health concerns and
the industry is willing to take the social responsibility in protecting
everyone  ' s health
""
it has undergone soul searching in seeking a balance between its
business and its social responses
""
some of owners had already taken effective measures to enhance
better ventilation
""
the findings of a trade impact study regarding proposed smoking ban
 con  by international consultancy firm kpmg suggested that the
implementation of a total smoking ban will result in a ten point six percent
fall in restaurants bars cafes and hotel  one-word  and
beverages outlet receipts and that amounts to a total  lost  of sales
of  sev  nine billion each year
""
if employment is to be reduced to a similar extent this would lead
to a loss of twenty one thousand jobs in the hospitality trade
""
a full record of the approach and methodology taken by the firm is
publicly available for review
""
any interested party can assess it on my web site w w w tommy
cheung dot com
""
the study confirms a banning smoking will result in negative
economic impacts on the catering and the hospitality trade
""
but recent government officials keep reminding us the experiences
learned overseas mainly in america and australia and jumped to the conclusion
that the world is moving towards a more rigid  over  public smoking
""
two points need to be raised under this argument
""
first it is not a world trend to ban smoking in restaurants
""
us had not implement a  com  ban in all its states
""
the whole of europe has no smoking ban in restaurants
""
singapore is the only city in asia with a smoking ban
""
canada did it in two of its provinces b c and ontario
""
secondly the sales increase recorded from overseas experiences may
not necessarily be the result of a complete smoking ban
""
let  ' s take the example used most frequently by the government
california
""
during the multiple years of growing economy restaurants in
california recorded a six percent sales increase after smoking was banned in
restaurants
""
but is that sales increase a result of the robust economic growth
or is it due to banning smoking
""
besides if we were to look at the sales in catering industry of
california this year
""
if it is down do we blame it on a smoking ban
""
of course not we will explain that the sales decrease this year is
mainly due to the overall economic downturn and the september eleven
terrorist attack in new york
""
if that is the case how could we draw the conclusion that banning
smoking will benefit the catering industry with no harm at all
""
it would be overall economic environment that deters the sales of
the industry
""
i fully agree with the recent comments made by the chief executive
tung chee hwa when he attended the
""
he address question and answer session in the legislative council
""
he said that overseas experience could be taken as a reference but
we ought to look at figures in hong kong
""
this  ducted  by kpmg is done in hong kong
""
it surveyed eight hundred nineteen customers who are dining in
local establishments through face to face interviews
""
customers were asked about their current patronage and spending
patterns and to identify how these would change following a smoking ban
""
mr tung  ' s comment correlates with the conclusion made by the firm
regarding to the lessons learned from overseas
""
it suggested that overseas experiences are often unique to each
locations and we should viewed with a high degree of care
""
as smoking restriction overseas have taken a variety of different
forms and have been implemented very differently from place to place
""
they may not be directly comparable to the ban envisaged in hong
kong
""
i think this is a fair a comment
""
government officials also argued that you could only rely on
surveys to be done after smoking ban but not before it
""
but the most important point is banning smoking in hong kong is a
road of no return
""
we cannot ban smoking and then carry out an impact study afterwards
""
we have to envisage impact and then decide whether we should take
it or leave it or wait for a suitable time
""
on october second we saw an unprecedented rally consisted of an
estimated seven thousand employers and employees from different sectors of
the hospitality trade including restaurants hotels bars and karaokes
""
they marched onto the street to voice their strong objection
against government  ' s proposed smoking ban
""
the government must look into their concern
""
the proponents of the ban label the study as funded by tobacco
company
""
this is totally uncalled for
""
i like to reiterate the kpmg was solely engaged by the hong kong
catering industry association briefed by me personally and entirely working
on its own
""
it had generated an independent robust methodology which was
followed in a course of the study
""
at no time did kpmg receive communication from any third party 
re  to the study
""
should sources of funding have a direct influence on findings of
any survey by the same token surveys conducted by hong kong council on
smoking and health doctors anti- smoking organizations and government will be
biased too
""
the objectivity and validity of those surveys could also be
questioned
""
if a general rule who pays the piper calls the tune applies no
surveys in the whole world will be trustworthy
""
during the period of  econom  turn the loss of business due
to a smoking ban can be serious but sustainable
""
however during the period of economic downturn especially when the
industry has suffered for three continuous years and with the introduction of
the mandatory provident fund which sucked twenty billion a year from the
consumer market the pain would be  un 
""
i would like to make an analogy
""
pneumonia alone can be cured
""
we can fight it
""
but pneumonia together with other complications like 
two-words  can be fatal
""
the catering industry recorded a double digit decrease in sales
when compared to last year
""
it has already felt the pinch of a stagnation in continuous
economic downfall
""
unemployment rate is at historical high in the last thirty years
and is climbing
""
together with the nine one one incident can we suffer another blow
""
more importantly is there a real need or urgency for government to
impose such a low blow
""
smoking in restaurants does not have to be a contentious issue
""
we support voluntary restrictions and market forces
""
government can offer initiatives like reducing profit tax and
license fees to individual restaurants to encourage the industry in
implementing a smoke free environment
""
free market forces should and could change restaurants to smoke
free without legislation
""
like in the airlines it might take longer but definitely it will be
less painful and divisive to the community 
""
""
""
to all intellectuals
""
the robert chung hearing has been going on for more than a week
""
lengthy court-room-like proceedings have proved less interesting
than most people had expected
""
as you all know the incident has attracted concern from academic
and political community and from the international media as well
""
as members of the intellectual community maybe we should all be
deeply concerned and undergo some sort of soul-searching
""
i was out of town on vacation in the very two weeks during which
this incident got widespread coverage in the mass media
""
plus as a political commentator who not infrequently criticizes the
sar government i may have a minor interest in this incident
""
so i may not be the most appropriate person to comment on what had
happened
""
here i don't want to talk about the political aspects or
implications of this event or hearing
""
still what has unfolded in the past couple of weeks was deeply
unsettling to me and should disturb many an intellectual in the territory
""
in the first week of the hearing it seems that the whole university
as an institution plus the sar government with the help of senior counsels
are trying to crucify a lone academic
""
the counsels spared no pains to find fault in mr chung  ' s testimony
questioned his credibility and integrity for the purpose of protecting
institutions
""
no colleagues in the institution ever came to the help of this
university employee
""
they even tried to distant themselves from that academic
""
in a court-room-like hall with the institutions armed with
experienced senior counsels the imbalance in power is just too great to bear
""
this is not like david against goliath
""
david threw stones
""
robert chung did not have any
""
in the hearing we saw top-notched academics engaged in a fierce
battle of self-defense accusations denials selective memory and presentation
of facts in an attempt to protect themselves
""
some people remembered very clearly what was not said but could
remember very little what exactly was mentioned
""
some people overheard others reading newspapers
""
superiors drew a clear line between themselves and their
subordinate
""
secret society vcds
""
and a central question in the hearing is question of integrity and
credibility
""
ironically the hearing is supposed to be about revealing the truth
""
yet i wonder how many of those involved are really intent on
revealing the whole truth
""
it seems that the game has become a struggle among alternative ways
of presenting the truth
""
to those involved the truth always has many facets and everybody is
free to take the one that will put himself in the most advantageous position
""
academics should be dedicated to discovering the truth or so we
are told
""
however the process of the hearing just makes me think of the
current journal-publishing game in the academic world
""
all you have to do is to find some way to present the facts to
picture reality
""
the key is to get your reality accepted by others
""
the truth becomes less important if anybody ever cares
""
i don't think the representatives of the student union of hong
kong u and of the hong kong federation of students are fully representative
of the whole student body
""
student leaders are naturally more anti-establishment and are more
inclined to challenge authority than their fellow students
""
but i think they have a right to feel frustrated
""
just ask ourselves as teachers what kind of examples have we set
for them
""
we are supposed to impart knowledge to them to guide them to see
the truth
""
not to mention integrity and credibility
""
young people will only respect authority that deserves respect
""
wait a minute
""
let  ' s not only point fingers at those who are involved in the
hearing
""
i personally am not very sure how many of us in the academia when
under such pressures from the institutions will not do the same thing
""
let  ' s reflect on ourselves
""
in our daily endeavors we all have our full set of compromises to
academic freedom and academic integrity
""
our defense instincts may easily override our fragile sense of
righteousness
""
the source of pressure may be resource-related job-related though
seldom politically motivated
""
let me confess first
""
i consider myself making academic compromises every day
""
the incident just shows that we collectively need more courage to
face up to all kinds of possible pressures to safeguard the integrity of the
academic world
""
i graduated from the new asia college of the chinese university
""
the new asia college was founded by neo-confucianists such as
chien mu who saw the revitalization of the confucian culture in asia as their
major task
""
the motto of the college is cheng ming
""
simply put the school-founders believe that knowledge leads to
virtue and the goal of studying is to be a virtuous person
""
this is indeed a tall order for the students
""
this is a tall order even for established academics
""
let  ' s start with ourselves
""
if academics are to command respect from students we may have to
demonstrate both knowledge and virtue
""
may i also take the chance to tip the hat to doctor robert chung
who in the process of all these excruciating interrogations never tried to
hurt or accuse anybody although that may have put him in a disadvantageous
position
""
whatever the outcome of the hearing and of subsequent hearings the
damage is done
""
both robert chung and timothy wong have admitted that the event
has affected how they will choose polling topics in the future
""
people who are going to do research related to the popularity of
the sar government or anything politically sensitive are going to think twice
before they carry on
""
survey researches as one of the most common research techniques in
social science will always be read politically by some non-academics
""
more importantly the whole academic community suffers from a loss
in credibility
""
this has nothing to do with whether or not a particular university
is involved in political affairs
""
this has to do with the moral image and character our community
has offered in face of pressure
""
so may i paraphrase mr ronald arculli no matter what the result is
of this hearing there are no winners
""
the only loser is hong kong
""
and the academic community the biggest loser of all
""
political scientists generally think that institutions induce and
constrain behaviors
""
that means to protect academic freedom the most important things
are institutions such as freedom of expression and press autonomy of the
tertiary and research institutions rule of law et cetera et cetera
""
nevertheless this event clearly shows that academic freedom is
just so fragile that our institutions are not alone sufficient to defend it
""
to defend academic freedom we somehow need people who believe in
it and have the integrity and courage to stand up for it and sometimes be
punished for it
""
i am not sure all of us are up to this task
""
p s
""
when i address this letter to all intellectuals i in fact do not
have a specific group of people in mind
""
after all whether or not one is an intellectual is determined by
one  ' s state of mind and not by one  ' s status
""
i am still trying to become one
