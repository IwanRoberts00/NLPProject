what are you mostly spend on the night like watching tv or  yeah okay   night  what what at night yeah at night what do you do at home i just go online i got so bored at home dude like i want to go out because i have friends like one of my friend she works at marriott hotel  yah  yah huh and like she does front of front desk or whatever and so she finishes her shift at like twelve and then she comes out to lan kwai or something and then  yah  yah i think they they will always you know call you for going out yeah i can't go out and like i have a lot of friends who are back from university and like some of them are not haven't they haven't left university and stuff and i can't go out with them it ' s really annoying yah but you cannot i mean but i mean uh you haven't seen them for so long then you look like you know you ' re not getting close to them like the relationship is yah i know that is tut that ' s so that ' s so true you know exact exactly what happened to my friend and me we had a fight  and then she ' s like you know you ' re like ditching me in the last minute tut so   yah huh   uh huh   so how do you keep the the friendship well i try to meet them at least once a week you know  so i like yesterday for example i went to my friend ' s house  went there and spent a night and then watched movies  and   yah   yah   uh huh   but i prefer having a dinner or lunch instead of uh going out at night because mostly i don't want to spend too much i mean having a you know a normal dinner cos a normal dinner is is a affordable like you  could   oh yeah   yeah but you know lan kwai is so so so so so  yah i mean you always go to soho for having lunch dinner yeah i i never i never get there it ' s uh it ' s some places are are pretty reasonable in price they are not too expensive lan kwai is very sort of like different the actual proper restaurant but then uhm like you know the you know uhm when you it ' s like there ' s a lane of restaurants chinese restaurant  thai restaurants uh actually it ' s quite cheap there  uhm   uhm  uhm uhm we should go there one time i i actually been there like the past month like every week but yeah so you find some cheap some expensive  yah  yah but i just want to see like try some other dish like italian thai or et cetera et cetera  you know my friend from australia has just uh get get back from australia you know and then i always have have like uh expensive dinner with him because you know he was so rich  right   but he pays for it  and  yeah he pays for me wow but anyway but you know i mean it ' s not that i was poor and i i have to like getting help from him but i mean he he is so so generous and then he said i ' ll buy you the dinner like like one time you know uh we we we have a dinner in stanley uh i mean

out like uh repulse bay stanley to have a dinner that that is paid paid by me  that is so expensive  i know but it ' s so troublesome to get there it ' s like the biggest hassle you know yeah but i mean recently we don't have time to go out like even even go to mong kok or causeway bay just for window shopping no time you know huh yah uh what is your last time you know uh going out for shopping uh shopping i don't know probably like last i bought i haven't had a serious shopping spree in a long time so   yah   just walking around and then after five minutes you get back to the mtr it ' s
