""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
oh  many receivers 
""
""
uh fifty
 
""
three consoles and fifty   receivers  
""
""
 uh ha  
""
  uhm 
 
""
 bit   unusual 
""
""
not really if  they  work pay a visit
 
""
yeah 
""
""
but i don't know whether mr chow uh someone  two
words  you remember they would like to visit visit shandong and
  jinan yet 
""
yeah so far they   haven't yeah 
""
but demonstration now is go to  two words 
 
""
 but they haven't  
""
 yeah exactly  
""
 two words  
""
""
uh no uh yang
 
""
oh xiao yang 
""
""
da yang
 
""
da yang 
""
""
uh
 
""
uh 
""
""
because they have installed some
""
there are bedside panel in  two words  and the
beam are there was in  two word 
 
""
uhm uhm  a long pause 
""
oh  a long pause 
""
we should see uhm 
""
if you if you going you you might be going away next week then
 yeah 
""
""
uh no definitely
 
""
not definitely but uhm  see  alright
""
so next week sometime 
""
if if we  ' re going to taiwan and then then it might be in a
""
we can go thursday evening    
""
fourteenth evening and then just stay over the day and uh come
back in   the  
""
""
 yes  
""
 did   did mr did  mi mi  miss miss pun
 
""
no no i haven't talked to her 
""
""
why not we can
 
""
i don't know i mean mr
""
what do you say baverly you you talked to  mr xu quite often
you know i was talking to
""
i didn't really get any any answer as usual 
 
""
alright i i think interested in  several words
   money yeah  
 
""
 yeah exactly  
""
but but uh but that  ' s i mean it  ' s  it  ' s cooperation
""
i mean i think i need to uh     one word
 of  inviting them 
 
""
 yeah about  
""
yeah i think we we uh  talking about uh uh uh  doing
something in the at the hospitals in china but he he 
 
""
yeah but that that  ' s the purpose of it
""
we would   we want to  talk to him about  
the  
 
""
 yeah he think  
""
 yeah   he thinks it uhm uh uh 
""
if we ask him to do it then he will uh make up another company in
china and then we need to uhm
""
so it  ' s  several words 
""
that  ' s my impression 
""
""
and it  ' s so so good idea
""
i  i also be afraid that if  one word  mr
xu also interest in china market
 
""
but he is he is 
""
  he  ' s interested 
""
he  ' s interested but uhm i don't think
""
i think that he fears that  him going that him with us that
there is no
""
there is   no pro  fit for him   at the time
""
that we  will     that we will leave it with
someone else   which is  which is  ba  because basically
we just need him to uhm  to help us in the beginning to make contacts 
 and uh  and concepts and so forth 
""
""
 he  ' s interested  
""
 uh  
""
 uh ha uh ha  
""
 yes  
""
  becau   
""
 i see  
""
yes regarding the profit last time we have  dis  uh discuss
 several words  talk about that
 
""
yeah 
""
""
that  ' s why he may   interested in 
 
""
 exactly exactly  
""
you have to take a you have to take a dollar and sort of wave it  ' s
under its nose   otherwise  no interest 
""
""
 yes  
""
yeah
 
""
 several words  
""
""
but uhm no problem for for our sides
""
uh there are some uh seminar or something which are  co  to
learn something
""
  it doesn't matter how you do it that  ' s  all
 
""
 yeah yeah yeah  
""
no when i when i talked to him yesterday he said uh sure i mean
if you want me to hold the seminar you know i can do that and uh 
""
and i said well that  ' s not necessary we  ' re we just wanted to uh
to see what kind of seminar you might hold in taiwan   and then 
we can do it   ourselves  
""
""
 another idea  
""
 yeah  
""
another idea is that whether we can find out uh the september uh
medical information whether it can allow for the local company to take part
in it   
""
if  it  ' s possible we can try to find some local companies in
  shanghai to help us  to uh to join it and uh we pay and then
we put our    tech  our  equipment to
 
""
 yeah but he would  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm   i don't  know he might he might already have uh
""
""
he must have contacts with companies who who are in the medical
field already in mainland china 
""
""
 uh  
""
  yes he had give his
""
mr xu  has give me   some  contact uh in china
uh also xian or somewhere  yes  a long pause 
""
i have some contacts about that but have so far not yet paid them
a visit  one word  uh  so more detail expression 
""
but if we have all the chance and  one word  in
 in shanghai
""
  we  can contact this person
 
""
  three words 
""
i think he has already  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i do you remember that he  ' s uh last time he give me some uh
name card    two words  
""
i  ' ve made a copy
 
""
 yeah yeah i remember  
""
uh never mind never mind
""
uhm      but still it might be valuable to go
there and just uhm 
""
although he  ' s not he  ' s not very interested we could might go
anyway just  uh gatecrash this party and and and listen to what they doing
and and have a look at their exhibition      two
words  uh seminars and we  ' re interested    one
word  
""
just find a reference when we  ' re going to look into the
hospitals 
""
""
 uh ha  
""

""

 hotel i  ' m not sure
""
one  ' s beijing and the other is shanghai
""
 several words  two two city from the other
 
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah
 
""
but like he said that   uh   the army army
hospitals    the army hospital have something  that uh might
have reached a level of  uh sort of automation  within their care
system
""
we might be interested in looking into that 
""
uh never mind we  ' ll look at that  a long pause

this you put out in in in   in indifference 
different rooms   or wherever  in corridors or whatever

""
yeah this is just this is just uh  uhm

not this one
""
but they they communicate with the same principle as a as a as
remote control   television 
""
i get 
""
""
 not this  
""
 uh ha

what  ' s difference between this one and this one

""
really 
""
""
mislaid locator
 
""
no 
""
""

it i mean you can either you can either preprogramming it in uhm
 in uh uh   the wrong  area   okay

you can have the station in different places that you know 
 that  this
""
you can set the information like   alarm car one but then
it need  to be substation in in in   compartment one 
""
car two where   where  one word  and
 then that can can send out
""
compartment one uh wherever it   is  
""
""
  pre   
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yup yup yup yup yup  
""
 somewhere  
""
 yeah yeah uh  
""
 yes   yes
 
""
uh it doesn't have to sit on on
