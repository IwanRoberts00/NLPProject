uh so when things settled down in the perception then it becomes simple and clear and so a circle with with break you will see a circle that is a law of fenance but that particular uh phenomenon you can use a rule or a law to describe it that is called what a circle with break you will see it as a circle and is called   similarity  huh   similarity  no not similarity it ' s called   closure    closure  what   closure  closure yeah it ' s closure closure and if uh you have a number of dots and instead of seeing uhm a number of dots equal in distance from each other you would organize this material if if if the distance from other sometimes you will see there ' s row and sometime you will see it as column but if they are closed together for example in this distance closed together you will see three columns why that is a principle of   promixity  huh   promixity  proximity proximity  there is a principal of proximity okay and if you have although distance here is greater than this one  you may still see these as two rows i mean these two column you will still see as two column and that is called the principal of    promxi    similarity  similarity that is called the principal of similarity okay so all these are conceptual phenomenon when become settled down in front of the periphery it becomes simpler in form so instead of seeing six items in this picture what you see are two items the t two items is simpler than six item okay so picture of two item in being to see instead of picture of six items what is the third method the third method unidentified speeches  what is the third one unidentified speeches    invariant one-word  invariant yeah it ' s a very word invariant so it means uh invariant is something inside or outside invariant is something is outside so you want to detect you want to find out you want to pick up so to speak just like pick up a piece of chalk invariant is there i want to pick it up so you don't you don't pick it up with your hand you pick it up with your eye okay okay so invariant uh you pick up with your sensory organ of course you can still pick your pen by touching it uh this this is it uh uh pick picking up the invariant through the haptic  system okay you can pick this up through your ears you can pick the all the to carry up through your eye and you can pick this up with other sensory modalities pick up invariants and the invariant is form of ratio in the forms of complex variants okay the ratio is just a number in the complex variable we has dimension but its dimensions is quite different from the ordinary uh perimeter we have like speed like as a ration it has a different uh vari  a di di different uhm what ' s that uh dimension composed of a number of different perimeters but why it ' s called invariant because it does not change while other perimeter change like y equal to uh ax if a is invariant what does it mean a means invariant means it ' s constant it is constant so why why it ' s changed x is also changing like the relationship between y and x is a constant let ' s say a is true then whenever y is equal to four x equals to two when y equal to six x is equal to three and y is equal to eight and then x equal to four so while y and x are changing it ' s constant remained constant remain invariant so to speak okay so for example if uh a certain chair is sitable i mean you can sit on it you can actually see that the chair you can sit down or you get  a stone a piece of stone you can s uh you can sit on it okay it ' s an invariant invariant with what invariant with your height of your knee so suppose it ' s is uh uh a tall question call this uh see this chair is sitable but is nearly to his knee height okay another person who he is very short here his knee height is here and but this is this is uh also uh lower so this person will see this is sitable so the sitable property although it varies from person to person but you will find it constant here the constant is appropriate to the knee height okay that is not change that is invariant okay  now i ' ve shown you before that that uh which one is taller depends on this ratio of this one over this one okay so you may see that uh all these distance may be changing some some is here some is here and so on but you see the ratio of this one of over this one uh if they are of equal height no matter where you place it you have the same ratio  invariant so if the ratio is higher than the other one so no matter  how long this part is so if it is further very far away it ' s very short so the actual length varies the actual change okay but the fact is that this over this is greater this over this this is not change okay and this specify that this is taller than this one the lecturer asked the students whether they understood what he had just said so something is not change in this case the ratio uh or the difference in ratio is not change okay so this is an invariant okay you want to pick up in eye and immediately perceive the property of the world any other question uh you want to ask  if not we will continue to study memory the lecturer said he assumed everyone had watched the required materials in the library  now look at these there are three three rows of uh letter and object now see whether you can remember them all okay now i just give you a a a min a sec a minute uh i mean a second and you look at all these three rows okay we are going to think about in memory and thinking is what are their nature and how to improve that now we have a number of uh questions to consider first uh uh memory is coded in different stores so if you remember something is it remember means you put something in a store you see in question is what are the necessary necessary process to make memories permanent so only when memory are permanent then you can recall them you can remember them so how to make them permanent how to improve memory is recall a pure retrieval means taking it out from the memory store or it is a reconstruction what what factors would affect thinking so all these we we ' ll know after thi this class here is the uhm the outline so we will study three types of memories the sensory memory the short-term memory and the long-term memory and then we will talk about the active role of memory  under each memory whether it is sensory whether it is short-term or whether it is long-term we ' ll talk about the nature and we will prove its existence and also we will talk about decay or forgetting related to that kind of memory there are three kinds of memory sensory short-term and long-term and after that i think we have time and then we will talk about thinking what are the elements of thinking and the factors and style that affect of the effectiveness of thinking  let us start the first one sensory memory  now there are several kinds of sensory memory well actually the sensory memory is the residue the residual sensory excitation which still remains with your sensory receptor  immediately after the uh energy activate your your sensory cell so in the case of the uhm sensory receptor in the eye the photo receptor so immediately after its excitation here the light disappear but still this one is being activated remain activated so with a short period of time the cells still uh remain activated and there are at least two types that we have investigated the first is called iconic memory it ' s related to eye the second is calls echoic memory that is related to auditory one thing is very important is that every information is being processed so when you see with this iconic memory everything is being registered everything is being uh coded everything is being process okay the lecturer explained that the brain received every sensory stimulus and processed it  so in that sense is called parallel processing so parallel  if you are not uh pay attention to that particular item that particular item is already in your uh iconic memory let ' s say you ' re reading these nine letters oh no no no should be nine but twelve twelve uh and then i ask you to report the first line and then you actually report it with still the image in your mind still the image is there okay so although you have you are you are paying attention here although you are paying attention try to remember this last line but as as soon as you uh heard me say me a few cantonese words  suppose and then you try to pr reproduce try to report this first line and then actually you are looking it in your m in your mind inside the first line so you do not have to pay attention there because uh uh uh to to make a trace of the uh sensory information is already there so everything is being process they are processed in parallel this is very important so the first nature is that it is the residual excitation second is that in it is processed in parallel and third it is decayed very easily so it is it only exists here for a short period of time so if i ask you to report all these twelve letters you failed to do it performance therefore is only thirty percent why why why because it decay already so after you report the first line or at the beginning of the second line all these memory trace gone so all these is the all these memory trace are gone so you can only report at most a little bit over than one line okay so how long with this you take for the uh iconic memory to decay less than two seconds how long does it take for the iconic iconic co echoic memory to decay less than five second so it ' s true to five second everything is gone of course it depends on its strength of the sensory information if the strong light strong contrast it will stay there for a longer time if it is not it will b it will stay there for a shorter period of time okay if the sound is very loud it would leave a better uh echoic memory if the sound is weak then the echoic memory is very weak and it will die down more readily more quickly so again roughly it is from two second maximum for iconic memory and five second for echoic memory  now evidence of its existence uh is demonstrated by sperling if i ask you to report all these twelve letters and number and the performance is thirty percent if i uh give you the indication of a line it ' s about seventy percent seventy something percent if i have a a a a line underneath the letter nah if i want to reproduce report nine i have a bar underneath the the line afterwards immediately afterwards then you are going to report that particular letter above that line okay then the successiv successful rate will be one hundred percent so whether you are looking at this one or this one or this one which one when the letter is covere up and a a bar appear underneath a letter and one word you immediately can see the letter you can see virtually see in your iconic memory so the successful rate is one hundred percent so as the success rate is one hundred perce percent it means you can still have this letter in your memory of course if you uh as a time delay if you have a time delay uh let ' s say this the presentation of the letter here and this is uh disappear of uh these letters and here is the indication immediately afterwards you will have one hundred percent but suppose you have a time delay you would only give the bar at this time so this is a time delay and if performance ra performance rate will decrease if the uh delay is lengthened okay so it means that for example if it is later than it ' s longer than two second so all the memory all the iconic memory has decayed and then the performance here will be zero or by chance you have can only have uh let say uh a ten percent or five percent okay and so will explain uh uh could demonstrate the existence of these iconic memory in this method will also this iconic memory can be wiped out can be immediate immediately wiped out by using a technique called masking it ' s technique of masking what is masking masking is let ' s say uh now you can hear a word like uh ticket it appear for a very short period of time let ' s say appear only for uh nine millisecond okay nine millisecond and then immediately i cover it up that means this is the presentation of the ticket it only last uh nine millisecond and immediately i present another one another stimulus the stimulus is like this tapping sound  and the ticket and more ticket is being wiped out and ask you what can you see and you can see all only all the process not the ticket okay so this method is called masking to get rid of the iconic uh memory trace well this uh idea of masking it ' s very useful for a number of research so this this this is quite interesting uh kind of uh quite interesting kind of uh phenomenon uh in masking so this is the sensory memory so we will go to the second one the short- term memory  well previously people thought that you have a separate store memory store so a store for long-term memory a store for short-term memory the short-term and long-term they are of different stores and now they know that it is not the case short-term memory is only the activated portion of the storage long-term and the short-term are of the same in nature or the same location the only difference is that the portion which is called the short-term memory they are activated they are excited so suppose  you can think of the long-term memory as a connected network of cells  neuro cells so each neuros each neuron is a note is this picture so each note represent a certain item like this represent the bird and this represent the wing and this uh fly and so on
