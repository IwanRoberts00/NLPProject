good evening and welcome to newsline
""
i am maureen boyd
""
hamish macleod delivered his first budget this week and we  ' ve no
assurance of opinions on how we did
""
joining t l tsim and me tonight are three legislative councillors
""
vincent cheng as a member of the co-operative resources centre
""
dr huang chen ya represents the united democrats
""
and professor edward chen as an independent
""
welcome to you all
""
my first question to you uh hunag chen ya united democrats are not
happy with this budget uh you are asking for the financial secretary to raise
the personal tax level to increase spending in areas like education and
welfare
""
but how far are you prepared to take this fight
""
will if there are no changes will you vote down the budget 
""
""
well we will  c  certainly give it a serious
consideration but as you know we are approaching fellow legislative
councillors to see if they will if they come together to ask the fs to
improve the budget
 
""
well we  ' ve got two legislative councillors uh one on each side
vincent cheng let  ' s start with you
""
now as a member of the crc uh you did ask for the personal tax
allowance to be raised to fifty thousand dollars
""
are you prepared to go at least that far to push the financial
secretary to raise the level 
""
""
well some of my colleagues will go to see the financial
secretary and talk about it
""
uhm we are all of the opinion that the uh personal allowance should
be raised a little bit more
""
uhm but in  generalwise  i think the the fiscal  thrust
 itself is acceptable
""
i mean the budget itself on the whole  i think i myself find it
acceptable just that we should refine a little bit
""
for example by the  kepting  the raise increasing the raise
to a certain level
""
and also perhaps be a bit more generous in terms of the allowance
for uh for the middles class and the what we called the sandwich class
 
""
okay let  ' s go to edward chen next
""
are you prepared to uh to push the financial secretary to raise
the personal tax allowances 
""
""
well i  ' m not too concerned about the personal allowances
""
i am more concerned about the little income earner
""
say for those earning uh two hundred thousand dollar to about uh
forty thousand dollars a a a a month
""
my findings are that for those people earning this much money they
are paying and in fact a higher effective tax rate than people say in
singapore and and in japan
""
so it  ' s a myth to think that uh the middle income earners in hong
kong are paying uh relatively low tax
""
""
can we uhm go to a more general discussion of the financial
secretary  ' s budget
""
uhm this after all is not about tax allowances and the ceiling and
so on
""
are you happy with the way public finances being managed by the new
financial secretary
""
after all he did not come into this position with a lot of
experience on the management of public finance
""
now he  ' s got so many balls up in the air
""
is he jostling them with great facilities uh with with great
competence or do you find that in his rationale for doing various things
there are in fact a number of problems
""
""
i think he is a great as far as uh financial management is
concerned
""
for everybody he takes a little and then he gives a little
""
and we must bear in mind uh we have very much nineteen ninety seven
""
uh we have to uh maintain a certain amount of reverse uh by then
""
and it seems he gives us a very good news
""
by nineteen ninety seven we are going to have over seventy billion
dollars uh of reserves
""
so i have been saying this time is the nineteen ninety two budget
but for nineteen ninety seven
""
""
that is not the view of mr lu ping however
""
he criticised the financial secretary
""
and uhm according to mr lu he is uhm raising money to meet
expenditure levels and that according to mr lu again is contrary to the
spirit of basic law
""
now baroness dunn of course takes a different view
""
i think you know if i  ' m not an economist but but do you believe mr
lu  has the right to say this sort of thing at this particular time
""
""
well he has the right like everybody  body  else to
express his uh thought but i think it was very unwise for him uh to say these
things uh at this particular moment of time
""
and to me i think what he said doesn't make any economic logic
""
i oppose to what is written down in the basic law while i was a
member of the consultative committee
""
there  ' s no such thing as whether you uh spend according to revenue
or the other way round
""
because they should be decided all all at the same time
""
there  ' re certain basic needs we have to meet uh so what he what he
said has no uh economic logic at all
 
""
vincent cheng uh how important is this attack from lu ping
""
is is it a signal that hamish macleod or is it are we are we
talking about something totally different 
""
""
uh they could be talking about something  diff  uh
totally different
""
uh going back on the on the point of reserve which uhm somebody
think it may be a bit high
""
i share edward  ' s feeling that we need to have a comfortable level
of reserves
""
i i tell you why
""
the economic assumption is five percent all right
""
and our labour force grow is about is  ab  slightly less
than one percent
""
so we are looking for real productivity growth of about four
percent for the next seven year uh four or five six years
""
now that  ' s not going to be easy
""
uh even if we could achieve that that means the economy will still
be operating at maximum capacity
""
a lot of inflationary have uh uh uh pressure will be generated
""
therefore the chance of overshooting this five percent is actually
a a lot less than a chance of undershooting this target
""
uh in that case our revenue will come down
""
  on that 
 
""
 but given   your your group last week though as
demanded the surplus should be somewhere between five and ten billion dollars
""
and suggested that we take a a billion of that to help the uh you
know the the sandwich class
""
now we find out the reserve the surpluses fourteen billion dollars
""
""
""
well we agreed that uh perhaps we should uh uh increase
personal allowances as one of the tax span
""
that  ' s all
""
that will only take away a billion dollar two billion dollars
doesn't matter
""
but looking at at the uh level of reserve as a whole which has been
a a major point for discussion
""
i find that we should be uh we should maintain a rather high level
of reserves
""
because as we  ' ve said on economic side there is this chance of
undershooting
""
but on the expense  ' s side we have committed to us ourselves for a
lot of expenses
""
a lot of that are actually capital expenditure which even if there
is a cost overrun you can't stop it
""
for example the airport
""
if there is a cost overrun uh on that project what you are going to
do
""
you still have to spend
""
""
yeah
""
""
because you can't leave a hole on the ground all right
""
now in that case because we cannot  uh uh stop uh spending
because of the capital nature of these projects
""
it  ' s much safer for us to keep a higher level    of
reserve 
""
""
 i i   i think hamish macleod is genuinely
surprised that his policy of higher reserve uhm would meet with opposition
from the prc
""
i mean  i he he would be forgiven for thinking that this this is
a a a gift which the prc would love to have uhm but unfortunately this is not
the case
 
""
huang chen ya how do you read this attack from lu ping 
""
""
well i i think it  ' s uh extremely unfortunate because i think
he  ' s setting up a  pre  precedence
""
the precedence that is highly dangerous
""
because it would mean that if beijing can criticise what is very
much to a local event that the budget for hong kong itself
""
if they could do it this time then think about after nineteen
ninety seven
""
if  ev  every time the sar government presents a budget it
is the man in beijing tells them that this is done right or wrong there would
be no financial management in hong kong
""
it will all be done by the man in beijing
""
""
it must have occurred to you that he  ' s not actually getting
at the budget
""
he  ' s getting at something else to my mind
""
radio and television hong kong court of final appeal hms tamer or
the fad contract that  ' s been awarded to a british consortium
""
""
well certainly you know there is old chinese saying about you
know uh when when you are certainly actually waving the sword who are you
waving it at
""
but the fact nevertheless remains that uh he  ' s a setting a
precedence
""
and once he has set a precedence it will hold
""
and that is that the danger
""
i think that hong kong uh is facing
""
and i think part of the reason why hamish macloed is having this
big reserve is in fact that uh he has taken into what many other people have
not considered which is the political uncertainty facing hong kong
""
i mean if we have uh uh political crisis in china itself if we
have these and towards uh mistakes by uh people in beijing uh in how the way
they speak of our hong kong then we will have in fact uh unforeseeable uh
economic downturns
""
and government has to have a safety cushion for this kind of of
problems
 
""
okay that  ' s one thing but lu ping  ' s remarks i mean it seems
that uh uhm more and more people are turning to china to get the reaction on
on what happens in hong kong
""
and i want to ask uh you three how you would react to them
""
next week uh the advisors are going local advisers to the beijing
government are going to be appointed uh as the budget comes out
""
how are you going to react to uh seeing for example on this show
are there any other uh you know media interview of legislative councillor and
then uh a local advisor to the uh you know to the beijing government doctor
huang 
""
""
well i i think that in fact if if the newspapers are some of
the uh people that have been appointed have already started to write the
article in the newspaper and giving interviews and i think that uh in fact
that we have the scenario already of this group becoming a uh an alternative
equal to the uhm legislative council
""
i think this will become more and more so in the coming  
year 
 
""
 but   how are you going to react to that if uh you
know sitting on this show next week we are talking about the budget only we  ' ve
you only we  ' ve got uhm t s law or any other   uh  advisors 
""
  but if  
""
""
it doesn't matter why why why i why does it uh going to ask
""
you know we  ' re talking about logic
""
we are talking about reasoning
""
uh we we think that we are right
""
i  ' m sure we can face anyone  uh and lu ping or anybody
""
""
i wouldn't worry about that
""
i mean yes there are forty people who are appointed and they my
have some uh different status but they  ' re   if  they are they are
hong kong people so we can just talk about  matter right 
""
i i don't worry about it at all
""
""
 but  
""
well you two gentlemen are economists and mr lu ping is not
""
and he is suggesting that uh of all the three tools open to the
financial secretary the monetary approach the fiscal approach and the
budgetary approach
""
he seems to want to concentrate on just the budgetary
""
now of course you know this is wrong
""
like look at the way china manages its economy
""
who is he to tell us what to do about what what hong kong needs
and what hong kong doesn't need
""
""
well i suppose it  ' s not only just budgetary policy when it
comes to monetary policy
""
say uh i  ' m sure china if uh they want will make some uh noises
""
but this time i really offer this uh as if lu ping is talking all
about the one percent increase in uh in in in the profit tax
""
uh i  ' m sure probably it  ' s because of some reaction coming from
the businessmen  men  in hong kong
""
uh his concern is there should be no change
""
any change to hong kong before nineteen ninety seven is a
conspiracy
""
there must be some wrong reasons
""
i
""
""
actually quite a lot of hong kong businessmen have agreed to
that one percent increase in profit tax
""
""
but unfortunately at the same time there is also uh some
sector uh which would not agree to the one percent increase
""
uh again because in the basic law uh something is written down uh
uh uh  i  in the way that hong kong must maintain a low tax rate
although nobody knows what a low tax rate meant is
 
""
okay just let  ' s us take a break
""
uh when we come back talks more about hong kong  ' s budget
""
stay with us  recording continues after the commercial break
""
""
welcome back
""
let  ' s turn once again to the united democrats of hong kong and
their plans to push for changes to the to the budget
""
dr huang chen ya exactly what you are going to be doing
""
what kind of lobbying over the next few days before the debate on
uh the twentieth fifth and twentieth sixth of this month to gain support for
uh for changes to the budget 
""
""
well the udhk it be will approaching uh other members in the
uhm legislative council the major political groups and uh independence
""
and uh we  ' ll hoping that we can have a censes in fact uh to make
sure that the uh that  ' s well in fact modify the budget to the level that
will in fact make uh most people in hong kong much happier than uh what the
the settlement is at the present moment
""
what we wish to do is of course that uh uh the fs uh will in fact
uh make the uh allowances a little bit higher than what it is uh possibly as
close to our sixty four thousand uh as uh possible   uh  when in the
breakfast 
 
""
 but the financial secretary   has already said that
uh you know the budget is a package that there  ' s no room for tinkering
""
is it just uh do you consider just this is first step of the
negotiation
""
is there room for manoeuvre 
""
""
well i think last year uh with the tobacco tax of course uhm
uhm there were there was changes in fact
""
i  ' m sure that the it  ' s possible for the fs to change uh if he
wishes too
""
and if he will   that he 
 
""
 vincent cheng   how as a member of the csc i mean how
how hard are you prepared to push the financial secretary 
""
""
all my colleagues are still are still talking about it
""
and as for myself and my colleagues can only speak for myself
""
uh yes i like this year that are are are slight increase in in
personal allowance or wider tax span
""
  but  will i have it  s  uh  to  tomorrow
just on this package i think we certainly to vote it down
""
simply because of this few thousand dollars  of uh in terms of
uh personal allowances i mean the difference
 
""
 like   
""
""
sounds like you are going to have great difficulty doctor
hunag convincing crc members to go along with your plans and with you the 
archaised  plans
""
""
well we  ' ll we  ' ll see
""
uh i think uh will let uh events uh show the reality of situation
""
i think the crc members at in the last few days have shown that
uhm that they seem to be as concerned uh as we are about uh allowances and as
far as expenditure for uh needy areas   be  concerned
""
we  ' ll see whether they are willing to vote   or not we  ' ll
see what happen 
""
""
 yes  
""
 but you you you have   you have a a a difference 
 over  numbers
""
i think you are proposing   sixty four thousand and 
they would be more comfortable   with 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 well uh we we are  
""
 yes well   the yes we are we  ' re asking for a
consensual view
""
so may be the consensual view in the whole legco uh may not be
exactly uh where anyone parties stands
""
we hope we can have a consensual view that we can present to fs so
that in fact we have a   general view 
""
""
  per    perhaps i can tell you my view
""
my view is uh i don't think i  ' m going to vote against the budget
""
uh we must understand this is the first budget uh of uh mr macleod
""
uh he has to be very prudent and and then of course i  ' m not happy
with uh everything uh of his budget
""
for example i  ' m very concerned about the progressivity of the tax
system at this moment of time
""
it  ' s too steep uh at the beginning of the tax rate and suddenly
it becomes proportional
""
it doesn't fulfil the ability to pay a criteria of equity
""
but on the other hand by large is acceptable
""
because when we talked about it for example rates it  ' s very
regressive in a sense everybody have to uh the same proportion
""
however if you people do not want sales tax and again you want to
vote down the rates uh where can the government get some stable income
