""
""
the transition from british to chinese rule is coming to a
close 
""
in less than six months we shall enter a new era as a part of china
""
""
the major steps in preparation for this have been completed 
""
the chief executive has been appointed 
""
the provisional legislature has been set up 
""
thirty-three out of thirty-four of the current legislative council
members ran for election and won  and they are now the majority group in
the provisional legislature 
""
we need to work together now  to ensure that the remaining months
of the transition go off smoothly 
""
one remaining issue that need to be smoothen out  is the
perceived conflict of roles of those holding public office  and those who
will straddle the handover 
""
civil servants are happily not caught in this dilemma 
""
before the first of july nineteen ninety-seven they will simply
abide by the hong kong government  ' s instructions on how and to what extent
they may assist the first chief executive of the hong kong special
administrative region 
""
on first of july nineteen ninety-seven all the civil servants
become part of the team  that forms the sar government  under the
leadership of the chief executive 
""
it will be their duty to give him their full support 
""
for the legislative council however there will be no through train
""
the through train had been devised to give legislators an equally
smooth ride through the handover  enabling them to change their roles from
serving a colonial administration to working for hong kong under chinese
sovereignty 
""
but the train was derailed and we are now faced with the aftermath
""
with the termination of the office of members of the legislative
council on the thirtieth of june there is a very strong possibility that
along with this will go all the laws and regulations which underpin this
council  including the powers and privileges ordinance 
""
there is no point whingeing over the train wreck
""
we must work to minimize the damage 
""
but more than half of the current legco members  will  move
over to the provisional legislature will contribute significantly to
minimizing the damage
""
they will provide the continuity  and the experience in those
areas unaffected by the reversion of sovereignty 
""
their election to the provisional legislature has been a right 
and extremely popular move 
""
there will also be continuity insofar as the powers and privileges
of legislators are concerned 
""
article seventy-three subsection ten of the basic law ensure that
legislators can and i quote  summon as required when exercising the
above mentioned powers and functions  persons concerned to testify or give
evidence 
""
unquote 
""
whereas these powers and privileges of the current legislature are
provided for by an ordinance  in the sar these same powers and privileges
are enshrined in the basic law which is a mini-constitution of hong kong 
""
the powers and function of the sar legislature are also spelt out
in the basic law  some of which are familiar ones 
""
there are those of enacting amending or repealing laws 
examining and approving the budget  approving taxation and public
expenditure  raising question on the workings of the government 
debating any issue concerning public interest  receiving and handling
complaints from hong kong residents 
""
but the basic law also confers additional powers and functions 
not available to the current legislature 
""
the sar legislature can endorse the appointment and removal of
judges
""
it can also give the mandate to the chief justice of the court of
final appeal to form and chair an independent investigation on the
impeachment of the chief executive on grounds of serious breach of law or
dereliction of duty 
""
the current colonial legislature has no such powers 
""
however article forty-eight gives the chief executive the right to
decide in the light of security and vital public interests  whether
government officials or other personnels in charge of government affairs
should testify or give evidence before the legislature  or its committees
""
""
the current powers and privileges ordinance reserves similar rights
for the governor
""
in this respect there will be little change from the present
practice under section fourteen of the ordinance which deals with the
privileges of witnesses 
""
the sar government and legislature will need to focus on articles
forty-eight and seventy-three of the basic law  putting their energy to
achieving the right check and balance of powers given to them in the basic
law 
""
the current legislative council  ' s powers and privileges ordinance
was enacted under a system in which the legislature cannot impeach the
governor or endorse the appointment or removal of judges 
""
it is up to the wisdom of the sar government and legislature to
enact a new ordinance  which will reflect the new situation 
""
we have already the first chief executive mr c h tung in place to
form his government
""
the provisional legislature will start meeting at the end of this
month
""
it is now the responsibility of this new team to find the right
solution  and i am convinced that it will be achieved 
""
""
""
ever since we began the construction of the chek lap kok
airport there were thousands of jobs created in infrastructural projects
""
and in two years time there will be many more jobs available when
the airport opens for service 
""
as you will recall the airport project has overcome many hurdles
""
from nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety-five china and hong kong
work through the joint liaison group over a long period debating the costs
""
""
the final result was worth the prolonged fencing 
""
""
""
a few days ago the newspapers reported that the national
people  ' s congress standing committee has begun to consider hong kong  ' s
nationality and right of abode issue
""
it is now known that the standing committee has put on its agenda
for their meeting later on within this month to consider the preparatory
committee  ' s decision on how to implement the chinese nationality law in the
hong kong special administrative region 
""
the decision of the preparatory committee is to the effect that
 a  people of chinese origin born in china including hong
kong  who are residents of the territory shall be regarded as chinese
nationals 
""
 b  any such chinese national who acquires
another nationality must make a declaration of such a change at the
immigration department of the hong kong special administrative region  to
enable the person to claim  consular  protection within china or in
hong kong 
""
and  c  any such chinese national as defined in
 a  can hold other travel documents but cannot claim 
consular  protection or other forms of assistance from the country
issuing such documents unless they make a declaration 
""
it is of utmost importance that hong kong people of chinese origin
holding foreign passports should fully understand the implication of these
recommendations before they make the choice of nationality 
""
to give you an example  the singapore government responding to
newspaper inquiries has announced that hong kong emigrants using travel
documents other than the singapore passport stand to lose their singapore
nationality 
""
it would be wise therefore for such emigrants to make declaration
of his singapore nationality at the immigration department of the hong kong
special administrative region 
""
hong kong people of chinese origin who have emigrated to other
south east asian countries  in particular indonesia malaysia the
philippines and thailand will be wise to follow this procedure because of the
historical and sensitive reasons behind this 
""
in nineteen eighty china amended its nationality law to ensure that
people of chinese origin in those countries will not be allowed to hold dual
nationality 
""
holders of foreign passports will also be wise to read carefully
instructions or warnings contained in these passports 
""
for example  the united states passport warns against loss of us
nationality should the holder take an oath  or make a declaration of
allegiance  serve in the armed forces  or accept employment in the
government of another country 
""
the british passport clearly states that any foreigner who acquires
british citizenship does not necessarily cause loss of nationality of origin
""
""
this means that the hong kong person holding a full british
passport may be subjected to all the laws of hong kong and the basic law when
such a person is back in hong kong after nineteen ninety-seven 
""
the singapore passport requires its holders to register with
embassies or consulates when they reside abroad 
""
hong kong people who hold foreign passports must therefore have a
clear understanding of what foreign nationality requires of them  when
considering whether or not to register with the immigration department of the
hong kong special administrative region 
""
clearly there are some problems which must be resolved before china  ' s
resumption of sovereignty on first july next year 
""
the number of people who may have to make a declaration of his
foreign nationality is not known 
""
it may run into several hundred thousand 
""
no one has any clear idea not even the immigration department so
the undertaking may turn out to be an onerous one 
""
it would therefore help to ease the burden if some form of
registration could begin before first july nineteen ninety-seven 
""
 but  would the hong kong special administrative region
government regard such registration as valid 
""
would the british cooperate to ensure such an exercise is carried
out properly 
""
would it be possible for people of chinese origin holding foreign
passports to register with their own consulates  and then for these
consulates to notify the special administrative region government en bloc who
are on their registers 
""
will the special administrative region government recognize such en
bloc notifications 
""
if the special administrative region government must follow the
rule that individuals have to make a declaration of their change of
nationality at the immigration department personally  can the hong kong
special administrative region government allow a grace period  of say six
months after the resumption of chinese sovereignty for these people to make
the declaration themselves and then allow it to take retrospective effect 
""
these are some of the questions raised by the preparatory committee  ' s
recommendations 
""
they do require urgent solution  so that the necessary
legislations can be drafted before china  ' s resumption of sovereignty 
""
persons of chinese origin who are born in hong kong and become
foreign passport holders for their part need to consider carefully whether
they want  consular  protection after first july nineteen ninety-seven
 and whether they should register themselves with their respective
consulates before the transfer of sovereignty 
""
the choice of making a declaration of one  ' s nationality should be
a conscientious and deliberate act  made after carefully consideration
""
it is important therefore that no one should be expected to make a
declaration of foreign nationality by simply filling up a form in an aircraft
or on board ship on the way back to hong kong 
""
the best way of course would be to ensure that such declarations
can only be made in hong kong at the immigration department  on production
of a valid foreign passport  or a certificate from the  consul 
general of that foreign country
""
the department itself should have no discretionary power  to
disallow such declarations 
""
i believe that china is allowing hong kong people to enjoy maximum
flexibility in choosing their nationality without jeopardizing the original
intention behind the enactment of its nationality law in nineteen eighty 
""
i hope that the standing committee will endorse the preparatory
committee  ' s recommendations  with a proviso that the preparatory
committee will study the problems that may arise out of its implementation
 and find a solution that will cause the least anxiety  
""
""
""
we have entered the final year of the transition to chinese
sovereignty 
""
in fact there are less than three hundred and sixty-five days to go
""
""
now more than ever we must work hard to keep things on an even keel
""
""
sino-british relationship seems to have improved
""
i sincerely hope things will get better so that the change over
next year will go off smoothly 
""
however there is one area of growing concern
""
i refer specifically to the civil service  the one area which
all parties hong kong people the administration the chinese and british
governments have unanimously agreed should not be involved in any political
conflict 
""
the civil service is the cornerstone of our system
""
its stability and integrity is crucial  to a smooth transition
and continued stability after nineteen ninety-seven 
""
it would be unwise from my view for the public or the media to
expect or to put pressure on any public servant  to declare a personal
political point of view  or take a stance on any political issue in its
relation to china 
""
let me give some examples of what is happening 
""
the chief secretary mrs anson chan  fan on san  has been
pressed many times by the media in recent weeks to say if she has changed her
stance on the provisional legislature 
""
it is as if she  ' s being made to identify her own political views
to determine whether she is pro-china or anti-china on a particular issue 
""
if civil servants were to join the selection committee they would
not be merely participating in the selection of the chief executive
""
they would also have to support the provisional legislature 
""
now this would mean taking publicly a stance on a political issue
""
this seems to me to be a contradiction 
""
on the one hand we cherish the traditions and virtues of the civil
service
""
we want it to remain neutral and to continue to provide us with
honest efficient administration 
""
we want our civil servants to be on and administrative through
train for a smooth transition 
""
on the other hand the media wants or expects civil servants to
adopt an anti-china stance in order to prove that they are working in the
interests of hong kong people 
""
this is a conflicting and muddled approach to the problem of
managing a smooth transition for the civil service 
""
the position should be very clear to all 
""
before thirtieth of june nineteen ninety-seven our civil servants
are expected to speak and work in line with the policies of the hong kong
government  the current administration
""
after that date when sovereignty rests with china  those civil
servants who remain will speak and act in line with the policies of the hong
kong special administrative region government 
""
the transfer of power is entirely between the governments of china
and britain 
""
this is to be carried through the joint liaison group 
""
that is what the jlg was set up for  and it is their assignment
""
all the problems between the two governments have to be ironed out
or fought out there  without involving the civil servants 
""
neither the british nor the chinese government nor even the public
or the media should expect or request any civil servant to be personally
identified with any pro-china or anti-china issue in respect of the setting
up of the sar government  including the election of the chief executive or
the establishment of the provisional legislature
""
we want them to stay at their work without being caught in the
middle
