uhm mr au yeung when you discovered that you that your pager perhaps uh take a look at exhibit d one cantonese translation d one the pager cantonese translation  is that your pager cantonese translation     it ' s mine  well open the wrapper you will find ' you will find ' overlap unclear cantonese translation    yes that one yes  now that morning twenty seventh of february when you discovered  that your pager was missing were you worried cantonese translation and answer    yes worried  why were you worried recording fast-forwards    uh because i guessed that it might be the lady complainant  whom i had just had the struggle with uh that had picked it up  why were you concerned that your pager might have been picked up by the lady complainant cantonese word recording fast-forwards    clear that uh yes uh she might uh yes after picking up this pager will go to the police station sorry to accuse me that is to frame me with the allegation that i had i had tried to yes rape her  now mr au yeung tell me this why did you worry about an attempted rape an allegation of attempted rape recording fast-forwards   because i really have had the sex transaction with her  yes but uh that transaction with madam ho if i understand you correctly was entirely with her consent cantonese answer recording fast-forwards    yes  and according to you it was madam ho who suggested to you to have sex with her in return for f for five hundred dollars is that right cantonese translation and answer    yes that ' s right  well that being the case why did you think that she might frame you or she might report you f for attempted attempting to rape her i cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    at that time her uh yes uh causing her injury uh and i had pushed her out of the taxi uh   yes cantonese question    and i also forgot to pay her the money cantonese answer  recording fast-forwards    so if she was the person who really had picked up my pager uh then i feared that he would go to uh report uh accusing me yes of raping her uh and that ' s why i was frightened  but according to you madam ho assaulted you first  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    yes he she was the one she was the one who who uh set her hands on me uh to assaulted me first but then uh uh in return i had assaulted her  causing her in causing her injury and then i i pushed her out of the taxi and i drove away myself so so if she really had picked up my pager then she must be very crossed with me and then she would revenge  i making the report to the police uh uh that i had raped her and that ' s why i feared that some thing some thing of bad nature will happen and so i had to uh go to the police station and  made a report made a report in advance first  when you made a report to the police did you complain of the assault by madam ho or did you complain of the lost of your pager  cantonese words recording fast-forwards    i one word uh in saying that i had had a struggle with a female passenger cantonese question and answer    and i suspect i suspect that it was during the time when i was struggling with her then uh then i lost my pager cantonese answer    well and i also told the police that uh since i had assaulted her  yes and made made her injured so i feared that she might have picked up my pager and then she would go to a police station to report against me uh accusing me of of raping her  oh i see now tell me this mr au yeung if you had not lost your pager would you have gone to the police cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards    then for the time being i would not have this intention  now mr au yeung is it the truth of the matter is because you had attempted to rape madam ho and because you had you feared that she might have got hold of your pager that you went to the police first in order to get in first   yes uh  and you realised mr au yeung that one if madam ho had got your pager this would lead to the disclosure or discover of your identity is that right cantonese word recording fast-forwards    yes i realised that yes  and were you afraid that your identity might be discovered   well i uhm i knew that if if she really took my pager to the police station to make a report uh then certainly yes my identity will be found out  and my question is mr au yeung were you afraid that your identity might be discovered 'that your identity ' overlap ' nàh gouh mahn tàih haih ' -'the problem is ' cantonese translation and answer   recording fast-forwards    but if i did not yes make a report in advance uh then uh then suppose she she became the first one who went to the police station to make a report then then it will be very difficult for me to put up an explanation that will be believed by the police  now mr au yeung you still have not answered my question my question is were you afraid that your identity might be discovered cantonese translation recording fast-forwards   cantonese question    well i have already answered that is as i told the court uh since i had yes i registered with my true address true address uh yes in the purchase of this pager so certainly if if she had picked up the pager and yes and she went to the police station then then uh well then my identity my identity will certainly be traced and found    mr uh are you two words you are being asked whether or not you were frightened that your identity would be a few words question i think you can answer yes or no    yes cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    well as far as my feeling is concerned uh yes there ' s nothing to do with whether i was afraid or not but but my idea is that i should go to the police station to make a report in advance  all right mr au yeung i ' m not going to sort of waste further time on this point if you don't want to answer now let me ask you this did you think that by going to the police first you are in a more advantageous position   uh would not occurred to me to think about it this way  yes but a moment ago i thought you told my lord and the jury that uh if you were to go to the police first uh if you were to go to the police later meaning my understanding is later than madam ho you would find it more difficult to explain yourself or worse will that in fact  cantonese word recording fast-forwards  it would recording fast-forwards cantonese word is that not an advantage for reporting the matter first  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    it ' s not a not a not a question uh concerning advantages or not but but as far as i was concerned i thought that i should i should go to the police to make a report  now let me ask you just once more did you think that you were in a more advantageous position by reporting to the police first recording fast-forwards    what about uh yes uh which between us which between us would report first to the police but anyway my idea was that i should go to the police and made a report in advance  all right let me move on to another subject cantonese translation  my lord i ' ll be moving on to another would your lordship like to move on is this is this a convenient moment or would your lo      yes all right a few words   recording restarts   part of the recording missing did it take you to drive from the spot where madam ho boarded the taxi until the point when you reached the hong shing garden recording fast-forwards    uh about ten minutes drive unidentified speech  and you say during those ten minutes you had this detailed conversation with madam ho is that right   yes  and can you confirm that you had told my lord and the jury each and everything about the conversation you had with madam ho  cantonese translation    well yes nearly nearly i told the court everything  yes uhm and is there anything further you would like to supplement cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    well nothing for the time being  during the journey when you first had a conversation with madam ho did you ask her the name of the karaoke lounge she was working in o> cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    no i did not  why not cantonese translation and answer    well well because i reflected that what i was talking to her during this conversation was was nearly words that means we ' re we ' re just purely talking to each other  yes are you saying that uh whatever you told madam ho you didn't mean it at all cantonese answer    well what i mean is that uh we were only having some casual chat uh that means even if after i heard heard about it that that doesn't necessarily mean that i had to visit that place  and of course you have told us that she has asked you to patronise her is that right recording fast-forwards    yes  did you tell her that you would do so in your spare time  recording fast-forwards    well i think is that okay  and did you follow that up by asking her where was your  r karaoke lounge recording fast-forwards  and its name recording fast-forwards    in about recording fast-forwards    in fact at the early beginning i had already asked that and she had told me that it was at wanchai  but mr au yeung we must realise that in wanchai is big area  cantonese translation and answer  and there are many many     yes i had sorry sorry cantonese translation and answer    well cantonese answer    yes but i did not really intended that i will certainly visit that place  yeah   and that ' s why sorry and that ' s why it did not occur to me to asking her for that particulars  anyway as what you knew about her was that she was working in a karaoke lounge somewhere in wanchai cantonese word recording fast-forwards    yes  and that is all you knew about her recording fast-forwards cantonese answer    uh well i knew that she was working in a karaoke lounge  and that was all you knew about her a cantonese word   recording fast-forwards    yes  did you ask her in what capacity she was employed in this karaoke a few cantonese words recording fast-forwards    uh i did not ask her in such a great detail  well what you mean the question is a simple one did you or did you not ask her in what capacity she was employed in the karaoke recording fast-forwards  and in your mind what did you think she was cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    i did not pay much attention to what sort of occupation she had  no my question is mr au yeung what did you yourself think she was employed as in this karaoke   yes in my mind yes i did not think this way that is i was only chatting casually with her so so i did not feel that uh nothing need as necessary for me to to question her in such great details  it did occur to you that she was a pr in the karaoke  recording fast-forwards    yes uh this idea uh also came to my minds  so in other words you thought that she was a pr girl in the karaoke is that right cantonese word recording fast-forwards   perhaps so  what you mean perhaps so cantonese translation and answer   well that is uh yes after i had h i had heard her saying these kind of things uh then then i also had this kind of idea that perhaps she was  when did it occur to you that she was a pr girl in the karaoke cantonese translation and answer    well up to the moment when she suggested of asking me to help her  financially cantonese translation and answer  recording fast-forwards    by the time cantonese words when it when it when it came to my mind that uh i realised she was seducing me to carry that out  what do you mean by that cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards  seduce you cantonese words recording fast-forwards    by the time when she uh put those questions to me then uh when she eventually asked me to help her uh then then i realised that she had this sort of idea  did madam ho ever tell you that she was prepared to have sex with you if you pay her five hundred dollars cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards    she did not directly say those words  what make you think that she was going to have sex with you  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    during the conversation uh and also uh when she asked me for this sum of money  five hundred dollars cantonese translation    yes  and you you thought she was go was going to have sex with you for five hundred dollars is that what you are saying cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    yes  did it come as a surprise to you cantonese translation and answer    yes and that ' s why i had to thought it over for a while  and having thought the matter over for a while what did you do cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    then i promised her uh yes i said that i would pay her the five hundred dollars  and did you really mean to pay her the five hundred dollars  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards cantonese answer    yes i ' m yes i was thinking that yes after yes uh after uh these things had been done then i would pay her five hundred dollars   a long pause  and at that time mr au yeung did you have a sexual urge  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    yes  presumably you look at her did you not cantonese translation  when she made the suggestion ' when she ' overlap ' nàh gám jik haih ' - ' so that is to say ' cantonese translation and answer   well then sometimes yes uh then i would glance at her glance at her yes through the rear view mirror  and uh did you find her attractive cantonese translation and answer    i could not her see her very clearly because at that time it was very dark inside the compartment of the taxi  for example because it was dark you couldn't see her face clearly right cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    not very clearly that ' s right  you could not even for example see clearly what her figure was cantonese translation and answer    that ' s right uh as for her bo body built not very clearly seen  and for that matter you did not even have any idea as to how old she was recording fast-forwards    well but i estimated that uh yes she must be uh uh in in her thirties around thirty years old  and yet at a suggestion of someone a woman who f  whose face you have not clearly seen and whose figure you had no idea whatsoever and a woman whom you thought to a pr girl in a karaoke at her suggestion of sex and all of a sudden you had this sexual urge is that what you are telling us recording fast-forwards  now you say you then or then there was this agreement for sex for five hundred dollars cantonese translation and answer    yes  now mr au yeung if i understand you correctly you had previous sexual experiences with hostesses interruption is that right cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  now prior to the twenty seventh of february of last year  on how many occasions did you have sexual experiences with hostesses  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    for how long before that   uhm   i find it subjective this line of question uh uhm ' uhm ' overlaps the court interpreter ' s speech i don't think this is relevant to uh the issues before the court the fact that uh he may have sex experience sexual experiences and the previous  two words would not be relevant to the present issues my lord if my learned friend would would bear with me  a few more questions    yes i  yeah  he will see the relevance    a few words  i ' m all right would you answer the question please cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards     o occurred inside the car or or what   p please just answer the general question don't expect any other questions come with it just answer this question   but i don't understand the question do do you mean that altogether  all right     and from the very beginning up to to that date how many times in total i have had with the with those hostesses or just confine to the question to how many times i had done these kind of things inside the compartment of a taxi  well to be fair with you let us take one at a time  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  did for a period of six months prior to the eventful night  on how many occasions did you have sex with hostesses for payment   yes three to four times  yes and during those three or four times where did you have sex with these hostesses ' with these ' overlap unclear cantonese translation  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    uh sometimes in the compartment of the taxi cantonese question and answer    sometimes we will go to rent a room  and can you remember for those three or four times prior to the twenty seventh of february last year on how many occasions did you go to an apartment and on how many occasions you did it inside a taxi recording fast-forwards    well two times inside the taxi  and the remaining one or two times in an apartment  cantonese translation and answer    yes  and on those three or four occasions uh how much did you pay  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    well each time then i will pay yes something between five hundred to one thousand  yes and for you may i take it that it was a reasonable price to have sex with a hostess inside a taxi for five hundred dollars is that right  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    uh i regard if i regarded uhm uhm if i regarded that uh she is of the value that is it is cantonese speeches    uh it ' s good value good value then i will think that reasonable yes what what do you think is a good value mr au yeung ' mr au yeung ' overlap ' gám ' - ' so ' cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    i feel that it was right that means provided i feel that that is right to pay such a price  now mr au yeung you haven't you still haven't given us your yardstick what is your standard   yes cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    that is after i had seen the uh seen the hostess then if i regarded uh she was of good value uh then uh then that ' s the amount i will pay her  but mr au yeung on this occasion on the twenty seventh of february you did not even have a good look at madam ho cantonese translation   ' did ' overlaps the ' gám néih ' - ' so you ' did you come to the conclusion that she was worth five hundred dollars that you were going to pay cantonese translation recording fast-forwards   those yes for those recent for those uh for the time recently to that uh i had yes won some money so i had money at that time and also at that moment i had that sexual sexual urge  so you had lots of money to spare on the twenty seventh of february is that what you are saying cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards, part of speaker a ' s speech deleted  care whether the merchandise is up to value   merchandise cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    yes because at that stage i was comparat comparatively uh better off  and you are sure all that cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards    yes  now how many how much money did you have on the twenty seventh of february cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    at that time within my reach that is the turnover the business sorry i still haven't got an answer from you mr au  cantonese translation  my question is a simple one how much money did you have ' my ' overlaps unclear cantonese word cantonese translation     a few sentences  no on on his person cantonese translation    not yet cantonese translation and answer  recording fast-forwards    including the business turnover    how much money did you have at first in a taxi on the twenty seventh of february cantonese translation recording fast-forwards cantonese translation and answer    i will say including the coins about six hundred dollars in cash well in that case why did you tell madam ho on your on your own version after the event that you had not enough money to pay her  recording fast forwards  willing to pay her three hundred recording fast forwards  cantonese translation and answer    because all my money is in the bank  now let me read to you what you said this morning not too long ago   yes cantonese translation  now this is in examination in chief in answer to questions by your own counsel cantonese translation  you said even if i count all my money and give you everything i fear i might not have enough money cantonese translation  you remember saying that cantonese translation and answer   yes  you still say that you had the money to pay madam ho assuming that your allegation is right cantonese translation and answer    well i did not really count the money i had but yes but i ' d i would presume that uh yes there would be enough money to pay her yes if i were willing to pay her  and of course you knew according to you that madam ho was furious she was angry because you didn't pay her right     yes cantonese translation and answer   recording fast forwards cantonese translation and answer    but at time i was actually bargaining with her  yes   i said that since since i could not do that successfully so uh would you mind to have a lesser sum so it was in fact did so it was in fact we were negotiating uh to a bargaining  but if i understand your evidence correctly the bargaining or the bargain fell through cantonese translation  madam ho insisted on having five hundred dollars from you  recording fast forwards cantonese translation and answer    well but before she really assaulted me uh then i thought that perhaps we could still go on to negotiate it  all right let me ask the question in another way on that eventful night did you or did not use or did you not think that madam ho was wil was willing to accept three hundred dollars from you cantonese translation and answer    but be but at that stage she had not yet uh mentioned whether she was or she was not to accept the lesser sum uh and she uh she had not told me  did she later on mention that she was not willing to accept the lesser sum cantonese translation and answer    she did not say those words she just said so now are you going to pay me or not  and what did you understand that to mean cantonese translation recording fast-forwards cantonese translation   that means she wanted uh to have me pay her the exact sum of five hundred dollars  so in other words she refused to accept cantonese translation  less than five five hundred dollars is that right ' less' overlaps ' gám wuhn geui syut wah ' - ' so that is to say', ' is that right' overlap ' nàh wuhn geui syut wah ' - ' so that is to say cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    i don't know whether she was willing to accept that  you mean to say after all this that had happened you still harboured that thought that she was willing to accept three hundred dollars from you cantonese translation and answer    well because at that stage i personally was also considering too what were you considering mr au yeung ' au yeung ' overlap ' háau lèuih -'think about ' cantonese translation and answer    well i was considering whether i should pay her the full amount of yes of the money  did you occur ' occur ' overlaps unclear cantonese translation sorry did it occur to you in order not to have further trouble to pay her five hundred dollars cantonese translation and answer   well bef uhm well before i uh before i could set my mind uh to think about it this way then she already start she already started to assault me so i was i was nearly thinking for it for a short while then she started  now let me ask you the question once more mr au yeung did it occur to you to pay her five hundred dollars in order to avoid any trouble cantonese translation recording fast-forwards   well indeed that was what i what i was thinking i was considering whether i should pay her the full amount  and because of the action which madam ho subsequently took namely assaulting you you changed your mind is that what you are telling us recording fast-forwards   cantonese answer    but at that time it did not occur to me to think about it in this uh think about it uh at these circumstances  all right let me ask my question in another way you said madam ho assaulted you cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards    yes  did it occur to you to pay her five hundred dollars instead of returning the gross cantonese translation    no because at that stage she just assaulted me out of no reason so i became very angry  uh take it that you knew she was a woman cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    yes  are you in the habit of uhm fighting with woman recording fast-forwards    not really  but you did on this occasion cantonese translation   recording fast-forwards    at first when she started assaulted me i nearly stretched my left hand to the back to yes press against her that is i grabbed her upper garment and tried to pin her down but then she went on assaulting me let me put it this to you mr au yeung there is absolutely no truth in what you said as regard this sexual transaction cantonese translation recording fast-forwards   incorrect  you are making up this story in order to save your ownself  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    no  now let me ask you this you said that you had described in a rather great detail as to what you did sexually with madam ho inside the taxi cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards  in describing your activities you mentioned that at one stage you laid on top of her recording fast-forwards    what stage do you mean  you mean to say there were there was more than one stage when you laid on top of her cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    well i don't understand your question in the sense that do you mean that by the time when i sprang forward upon her or by the time when i was uh doing doing that things to her that i laid on on her  how come mr au yeung we were talking about your sexual activities with madam ho inside the car recording fast-forwards  believe my question was very clear cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards  told us this morning that you laid on top of madam ho  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  at that time madam ho was completely naked naked  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    well that ' s right  and you of course were in a similar position   yes  did your penis touch her private part cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    yes i supposed there would be a mere touch a long pause now you also told us this morning that at some stage just before the sexual activity one word madam ho asked you whether you wanted a condom remember saying this ' remember ' overlaps ' gám ' - ' so '  cantonese translation and answer    yes  and who was you were present in court when madam ho was being cross- examined by your own counsel   yes that ' s right  and no doubt my learned friend will correct me if i ' m wrong this was never put to madam ho under cross-examination   well before the witness answers that question perhaps my learned friend look at the what i ' ve got in my instructions   do want to look at my learned friend ' s instructions and uh i ' m just cross-examining my the defendant here now   well i think a word  very well my lord uh if that is the case uh i i won't pursue madam ho then now you say after you pushed madam ho off the taxi you drove off is that right cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    yes  now du during this evening or this early morning was there any talk about the fare to be paid the taxi fare i mean 'the' overlap ' gám ' - ' so ' cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    when the taxi arrived there uh that was mentioned  who do you mean by saying that when the taxi arrived there  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    well that means just by the time when i parked the taxi  and who mentioned the question of fare cantonese answer   well at that time the lady complainant uh yes uh said smile  smiling me smiling said should i pay the taxi fare  so when when when was that cantonese translation and answer    that is by recording fast-forwards    that is just by the time when i mounted at the pavement and i stopped  and uh what did you say recording fast-forwards    well i said needed  and are you saying that this took place prior to the commencement of the sexual activity recording fast-forwards    that ' s right  now again mr mr au yeung i have to put it to you that that is not your case when your counsel was cross-examining the victim madam ho that is not that uh my impression is my lord i have a question on that well i will certainly read to my learned friend and your witness of course the exact pattern of words if my learned friend will bare with me for just one minute now i read to you towards the end of madam ho ' s cross-examination  recording fast-forwards  after the reference to this scuffle cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards  your counsel asked this question eventually the defendant opened the door and drove you out of the taxi  recording fast-forwards  and the answer from madam ho was no recording fast-forwards  questions the defendant never dragged you out of the taxi without letting you wear your trousers cantonese translation  answer not correct cantonese translation the question defendant never received taxi fare from you cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  answer incorrect cantonese translation question he never walked you to the lorry but incorrect cantonese translation     a few words in this set of question and it two words the witness that uh you asked him if he was to stop  i i i was going to that and then when the taxi stopped you ask what fare and the defendant said forget it and the defendant is agreed uh sorry and madam ho said this did not happen now my lord it is my respectful for submission that judging from the tone of the questioning the questioning came immediately after the scuffle   i don't hear him say that uh is certainly three words  an order but it was a few words  my lord well if i i if my lord doesn't read that   i agree with you in this in that uh that sequence  and that   yes   that ' s right this the sequence flows like that the the second part a few words     the the the question itself well that ' s uh how is it as being in power but it it is put it in an advice but one-word  and after the scuffling uh she didn't ask that the a few words i would a few sentences  well i if that is the opposition of m of of my lord then     they ' re relevant enough a sentence  cantonese translation  now mr au yeung let us come to a stage where you say you opened the taxi door and drove the uh drove madam ho out of the taxi  recording fast-forwards    yes  and so did madam ho fall to the ground recording fast-forwards  out of the taxi cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  that ' s what you said this morning cantonese translation  recording fast-forwards    yes she did yes  she fell she fell on the ground cantonese translation   yes  and then you said you fell you fell that when you f  finished the struggle you fear that something might happen cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  yes my lord uh of course i i ' m bound by your lordship ' s record so perhaps your lordship would be good enough to read out what your lordship has got that is towards the end of the examination sheet cantonese translation  of uh of my learned friend of the defendant 'the defendant ' overlap unclear cantonese translation cantonese translation    yes that ' s right  yes what what did you fear might happen cantonese translation recording fast-forwards cantonese answer    well that is after i has just yes finished having the fight with her uh then i fear that uh if the police vehicle just happened to drive passed there then perhaps she would report to the police that i had assaulted her so uh so that was the nature of the things that i would that i fear  but mr au yeung it was she who assaulted you first so why were you afraid you haven't done anything wrong ' haven't ' overlaps ' nàh'  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    even even though it was she who assaulted me first but uhm when it came to the time that she reported the case to police then it will be perfectly all right for her to say anything else for example she would say that i was the one who assaulted first or even i had raped her it ' s up to up to her to say anything she liked    yes  now mr au yeung does that mean that uhm the question of uh attempted rape was worrying you bothering you at that time ' at ' overlaps ' nàh'  recording fast-forwards    the time just because i was frightened and that ' s why i left the scene immediately  frightened of being discovered that you had attempted to rape madam ho cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  so what were you frightened of cantonese translation and answer    i did not know what she was going to say so so at least i fear that she might accuse me of assaulting her  now on that night you carried your knife exhibit d eight with you did you not cantonese translation recording fast-forwards   yes i it was uh hooked to to the waist band uh on my left hand side  so it was very handy for you to use it is that right  cantonese answer    well not not really very handy that is at least i had to use both of my hands to to uh uh to unbuckle unbuck unbuckle the hook  why wasn't it handy i thought your object of carrying the knife is to protect yourself in case you are being robbed cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  you did not make the knife handy ready to be used by you   because i felt that was an appropriate place a suitable place to to put a knife there  i put it to you mr au yeung there is not a thread of truth in your story cantonese translation and answer    incorrect  on that eventful night there was no conversation about this sexual transaction between you and madam ho cantonese translation and answer    you mean that was not mentioned at all  yes i ' m one-word to you cantonese translation and answer    i disagree  there was no mentioned whatsoever of this five hundred dollars in return of sex cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    disagree because she really asked me to go for a place  you yourself wanted or attempted to rape madam ho  cantonese translation recording fast-forwards    no  and madam ho put up a violent struggle cantonese translation recording fast-forwards  yes cantonese translation    really resisted by the time uh uh when we could not come to an agreement uh out of the bargaining of the price then she started to assault me then i hit her back uh and it was only at this stage then she started to struggle to resist  and i further put it to you that you produced this knife exhibit d eight cantonese translation recording fast-forwards   i not because actually i did not have the time to take it out and i further put it to you in order to uh fought yourself sufficient time to get away the semen of this vicious crime you took madam ho for a short walk when she had only her underpants cantonese translation  recording
