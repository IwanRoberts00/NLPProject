""
""
thank you henry
""
uhm i  ' m taking your hint i should be brief
""
uh and uh i would like to thank mr stephen lam for insisting that
uh we get on to this uh platform uh sharing  one-word  our
experiences in terms of environmental control with you
""
uhm  some of you may remember the uh opening of this uh business
and industry week  not that   one word   query
 why he was uh invited to open this this  week 
""
he wondered whether uh people suspect he knows uh something about
environmental control 
""
well indeed he does
""
he does know one or two things about environmental control because
 ansi  utility providing a service to uh people in hong kong  and
 particularly in kowloon and new territories
""
uh our activities do have an impact on the environment and the
 two-words  has been involved in the development of the
company
""
so it is very much closely involved in all the activities to uh
control environmental impact uh arising from  all the  activities
""
uh the company has a policy in terms of environmental control 
""
we will conduct our business in a balanced manner which is
compatible with the environmental social and economic needs of this 
one-word  community
""
so what we  w w  realize that any action that we take would
have an impact but  two words  counter measure will
probably give rise to other problems so we do have to  take a balanced
view 
""
uh in the next few minutes allocated to me i would like to share
some of our activities in terms of uh power  cons  uh power stations
its uh construction operation and also impact it has on the uh environment
and what measures we have adopted to control this uh this impact 
""
at the moment we have uh three power stations
""
uh one is at  hok yuen 
""
this is uh old power station which was developed in the nineteen
fifties and sixties 
""
next one is on tsing yi island
""
the third one is at castle peak
""
we are building a small power station on lantau island
""
this is a  two words  power station
""
it is a very small one used basically to uh uh meet emergency
needs of uh to to provide sort of standby power 
""
the early power station at  hok yuen  is a very old station
as i have mentioned
""
uh it was developed in the fifties and sixties
""
at that time this area was classified  as long  as an light
industrial area
""
so neighbours were factories uhm dockyards uh business like that
""
but increasingly this area is now uhm changing into a residential
recreation area
""
so we found that power station uh sitting in between the uh uh uh
uh residential units is becoming very incompatible
""
it is also getting old
""
so it is now being  dismantled and some of the machines will be
relocated to  the  existing power stations
""
so by next year uh this will disappear
""
the power station will disappear
""
this place uh some of you may know that we have asked cheung kong
to help re-develop this area into a residential and recreational uh facility
""
""
the tsing yi power station was built in the sixties 
""
when it was when we  con  when we start to plan for the
castle peak power station in the middle of nineteen seventies we start to
have a well  sort  out comprehensive environmental control program for
power stations
""
and by nineteen seventy seven nineteen seventy eight we did the
first comprehensive environmental impact study before we got to the
construction stage
""
so this power station uh which the the first unit the first unit
of  the  electricity was generated in nineteen eighty two
""
it was completed in nineteen ninety
""
the whole power station was completed in ninety eight nineteen
ninety
""
uh we got through eight nine years of development for the power
station
""
we now have a very comprehensive program uh in monitoring the
operation of the power station monitoring the  and  on the impact of
the power station and continue to uh research and investigate new
technologies which can be used to further minimize the environmental impact
from the power station
""
so the next few minutes i would like to introduce to you what we
did in the  environmen  impacts of the uh what we are doing now to
monitor its performance and that will lead me uh before i conclude to the new
power station which we are proposing 
""
this is a picture of the new castle peak power station
""
some of you may have the chance have visited it
""
we welcome people to come and see it
""
uhm it doesn't look like a power station uh from some of the
comments uh given to us by the visitors
""
it is a  two words  power station
""
but uh it is uh it is kept very clean
""
it is part of the culture uh we can keep it clean
""
we are very conscious of uh whatever impact it will have on the
environment 
""
the environmental impact study  is made up of five parts visual
uh aspect of the power station
""
the uh program to control solid waste disposal uh noise that will
come from the operation of the power station
""
water pollution because we use sea water to cool the uh the
machines uh and air pollution basically what will come out from the chimneys
""
as far as the visual part is concerned it  ' s relatively easy as
you saw in that picture i just show you
""
uh it is a  one-word  design landscaped area
""
there is not much noise coming from the power station and is kept
quite apart from the urban centers
""
but we do have a village next  sto  uh next to us
""
it  ' s about one or two kilometers from the power station
""
uh there are maybe two hundred houses there so we do have to make
sure the power station does not create  a  noise source for the
villagers 
""
uh i will like to in the next few slides discuss other than this
visual aspect and the noise aspect some of the other measures that we take to
control the uhm the problem
""
when we start with the planning we built a uh model of the power
station and the area in the uh castle peak uh tuen  muen  area
""
this is the power station
""
we put the whole model into a wind tunnel to decide uh whether
smoke coming from the chimney uh will have  an  any impact on the area
""
