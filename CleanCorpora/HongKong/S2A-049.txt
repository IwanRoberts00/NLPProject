<I>
good afternoon everyone
i would like first to thank kk for giving me this uhm opportunity to
uh talk to you about uh code switching and code mixing area which i haven
given quite a lot of courses
uh i ' m particularly in interested in being here to talk about this
topic because here is the place where a lot of work in this area has been
done
uhm i would say pioneering work
i ' m of course referring to the work uh done by doctor john gibbons
who collected code switching data between cantonese and english uh by asking
twenty seven students hong kong u students uhm in the nineteen eighties uh to
record and uh to report their own verbal behaviours which invariably included
some form of what we call at first one word 
and later on mix uh and in fact a lot of the information and details
can be found in this monograph which i suppose those at the back could not be
able to see
because uh the title is no longer one word 
uh well or we have to be uhm the force time including with it for
that way
uhm the uhm this present study was directly inspired by uh john
gibbons uh in terms of the methodology
uh in habit if you yourself reported language dairies with the out
or the one word 
uh and the details can be found on datas eighteen to
twenty one of his book
uhm and it ' s will it will become clear later
the study that is now firmly reported was primarily inspired by his
works and uh the language diary which i will go in detail minute
and this study has already appeared in ijb the international
journal bilingualism in the two issue of two thousand and two
uhm it is co-authored by a j a several words 
who work as a research assistant on the project 
i would try to leave it by presentation to about fifteen minutes
this is what happens uhm uh something important matter
uh hoping to leave uhm what time for discussion later
uh however if there is anything unclear in the course of the
presentation please give me to uh raise question and i ' ll try my best to
clarify a long pause 
okay
uh i would say a few words about current theories on code switching
uhm many of the current theories they focus on two major
types of motivation
the first type is sociolinguistic
the other is discourse related factors
some of the most important names uhm regarding with here
raising of code switching
uhm they are two words on social motivation of
code switching and a number of other big names associated with conversation
and discourse and related factors of code switching
they include john gambins are are very are widely
cited monograph uhm published in nineteen eighty two called discourse
strategies
and of course peter hour uh nineteen eighty four eighty
eight ninety five ninety eight uh on built on john gambins ' 
work on code switching as essentially a contextualization clue in
conversation
for example signalling a shift in topic or in one word
and of course it is one word who now works in
the uk
uh his book thee generations two languages one family has
meanwhile become a classic 
he also look at code switching similarly as in patronizing
patronizing a clue
uh for example signalling happens or is happens are using the same
or different language as used by the one word in the 
immediately receiving term
now what this mean is uhm typically it involves uh a mother and
a child in conversation and the complex in which is made his research uh is
in the uk uh the place more specifically is one word 
uh what he found is that very interestingly uh when a mother wants
to remind his child to work uh on his homework to try to complete work to try
to involve time to uh study
uh typically the question is asked in cantonese and
interestingly deway found that uhm
with regard to the child ' s response if the child likes the
idea of the mother reminding him or her to do academic work uh or uhm if he
uh complies to the mother ' s immediate reminder and therefore uh will turn
his attention her attention to uhm study
then he or she would use the same language which is cantonese
but on the other hand if the child resist the idea of study
that is the mother wants me to study but i don't like the idea then
he would signal his dispreference by responding in a lo 
in another language which in this case is english 
and i myself have done some work on code switching using uh hong
kong data
uhm in my own work i use cantonese english code switching as data
and my work on code switching rule out of a modest attempt
uhm perhaps i can date back to about ten years ago uh in an attempt
to try to explain to city u students why cantonese english code switching
occur so commonly in prestige of educated hong kong chinese
and in particular i wanted to see if it is possible to fix the
existing theories into our data
that is to see to what extent the current theories at the time
could help us explain cantonese english code switching behaviour uhm and i
 thinkly came to the conclusion that the current theories at the time
uhm you know social motivation in particular
they were not very cause form very convincing in terms of
explaining the types of code switching that take place especially between
peers uh between colleagues in the workplace where vital or no negotiation of
identity is formed 
and in my work data was collected from informal sections of the
hong kong chinese press for over eighteen months and the details reported in
a monograph published nineteen ninety six
the analysis let me to the observation that cantonese english code
switching in hong kong is primarily motivated by a variety of practice of
essentially a linguistic or semantic paragraph in particular
and i would elaborate on uh these concepts using illustrations of
uhm later on a long pause 
this is something that i ' ve been foreseen and so 
i suppose maybe some problem with the power i may have to use
the uh ac power 
so uhm a long pause 
i think one explanation is that uhm i ' m now operating with the
battery which is good for two hours
i suspect that is because i have using at the same time i open all
different files uh which probably explain why uh battery runs out so quickly
 a long pause 
maybe i could some one word a
long pause 
right so we are back several words 
okay so the concept that i came up with in my analysis they
include availability elsewhere refer to as lexical gap
specifically elsewhere refer to as one word in
conference
and the principle of economy alternatively known as the principle
of these happen
the analysis let me to believe further that the notion of
translation equipments across languages especially between cantonese and
english and chinese and english is one word 
hence the conclusion that code switching between cantonese and
english is more often than not
motivated consciously or subconsciously by a desire to avoid
unwanted semantic loss of mean 
i have a number of stock example that i would like to share with
you
that is these are typical english expressions that occur in our
otherwise cantonese conversation or discourses
uhm you can cite several words a long
pause 
okay i ' m still on this page
the stock examples those include uh noun and noun groups like happy
hour major speaker
a word that we will see in our uh data the word email call
powerpoint presentation and rave party
and example of verb or verb groups are the verb book call clip keep
present check in upgrade and update
also as given has observe sometimes the english terms are
comfortably more safety that is they come to our mind faster simply because
these are the terms that are taught in school
hence the effect of learning as a result of english medium
instruction
uh and given uses is the term concept formation 
now in terms of shortcoming of previous approaches in terms of
the methodological inadequacy uh
the approaches mention us now that is sociolinguistic discourse
related factors and the linguistic systematic motivations
they share one feature in common uh which is the factor they are
all premanenturing or one word 
they are mainly theory written analysis after the act of code
switching
so basically what the same here is we collect a body of data and
then we have find one particular theory in the hope of trying to account for
all the instances of code switching that we found meet the body later
and methodolog methodologically there ' s discuss 
one risk and the risk had has been pointed it out in the literature is
motivational stipulation 
that is different researchers they stipulate about
different motivations that uh uhm associated with certain instances of code
switching they observed being the data
and of course there is a problem of the map of crossal 
mind availability
by that i mean uhm interestingly so many experts have said things
about code switching especially the reasons why people code switch
but somehow the people who code switch themselves are maybe we can
all them code switchers they have no say
i mean it seems that up to now no researchers has bother to check
with the code switchers themselves uh what was the reason why you code switch
here or there at this particular incident
and this is what motivated me to look around for an alternative
methodology
one that would allow the code switchers themselves to say where
when and why they code switch and when i come across the famous technique in
 one word methodology known as revolution rule
destruction
i said to myself one word i thought a long
pause 
okay special interest in the methodologies of this study
now it makes use of that methodology called preparation rule
interruption and it presents the voices of twelve educated hong kong chinese
bilinguals and their thought and feelings toward english chinese code
switching
uh as mention it was inspired partly by john gibbons language diary
study published nineteen eighty seven involving twenty seven hong kong u
students
and uh carry down people abnormal methodological technique
call revolution rule disruption
uh what it means
revolution rule disruption would be uh discuss de now
what have i done 
and of course uh i don't know of course
the way that i have one word this machine
device that collected that uh this is something very use indeed uh in uh
 several words 
my excuse in several words 
looks like i have found like several words 
a long pause 
right so i ' ll check forty one indeed
okay the student participants for twelve of them they would oblige
to reflect on the nature and extend of their reminds on cantonese english
code switching in a normal communication with others especially with friends
and peers and the possible reasons why code switching seem so difficult to
avoid
now twelve being causal student participants for part in the
experiment they were self selected responding to the fingernail 
adverb
uh perhaps i don't need to go into the details
the adverb mean uh require them to work on a number of tasks and
the task uhm the let the resulted in
uh the data presented in this paper are they were only part of it
uh in terms of gender distribution ten female students and two
male students aged nineteen to twenty six years old 
why
profile of student participants uhm mother tongue cantonese
uh number of years learning canton uh learning english
sorry over fourteen years and english proficiency i will describe their 
english proficiency as between upper intermediate and advance 
okay most of the participant are there was a full time ra
in fact the ra uh contributed so much to the experiment to the
processing the data
uh it ' s difficult not to include the name in the paper that ' s
why she ended it up as co-author of the paper who name is kate shin 
uhm and the other eleven student participants they participated in
their capacity as part time student helpers which entitled them some more
disturb information
uh if any of them had any overseas studying or living experience
uh one female student uh coded as f three in the you know student three uh
spend a few years who refused to say exactly how many years but she will she
said at least uh for three years i will guess in an anglophone country
uh she took a degree from a an anglophone country that allow me to
use that she must have spent at least three years overseas there 
okay if they study any courses in sociolinguistics or bilingualism
uh with the exception of the co-author
none of the other student participants has studied any courses in
this area
now this one is important because uh we rely on self recorded data
if they have been exposed to many of the discussions in code
switching code mixing and so on then the discussion might have influence
their own thinking
the re uh possible result would be that the uh might had
simply one word 
uh we see wisdom uh that they heard or read in textbooks
uh so apart from the co-author uhm none of the other student
helpers or student participants has studied courses in sociolinguistics or
bilingualism 
okay
two kinds work of quantitated data we use in this study
the first kind is language dairies
uhm uh what happen was
the students were asked not to use english for one day and the all
the one word 
uh they were instructed to uh find tone the data by consolidating
the information they put down on the one word 
uh well uh other word pro one word i
think so
this is the one word that i am referring to
and each of them receive a soft copy of it right 
and if you compare this one word with page
eighteen of john gibbons ' book you find twenty of similarities
right page eighteen uhm nineteen to twenty one
a lot of the uh design uh was inspired by john gibbons ' home diary
studies 
right then the second type of data consists of transcriptions of
focus group interviews
uhm more on this data nineteen participants took place uh people
far of this 
experiment itself all student participants were instructed not
to use any english for one day
to record exact quote of english words that they wanted to use but
do not using a one word that is the one resort
and to share and discuss their feelings in a focus group interview
two days after the experiment
i still remember it was two words two thousand
uh when we were asked to uh perform this time 
before that three hour three thing and training was provided 
the purpose of the one word was to record key
factory information whose makes what to whom when and where
and uh finding notes and feelings and filling in missing
details before going to there that is uh they were given the instructions
that they all
they get some of the rich important details during the day
they had to use the one word to guide them and
filling the uh missing information before going to there
and within twenty four hours they were asked to submit a soft copy
of a two page reflected dairy explaining their own thought and feelings about
uh what happen you know
that is being artificially prevented from using english for twenty
four or the same or twelve hours
