old ones  more stylish and character looking   yeah i agree i agree i mean there are some there are some good ones now as well the news girls but  which one   i don't know her name is uh i don't know lot of their the new models   most  most of the new girls they are coming from singapore   oh yeah most come in from singapore   yes     yeah i know quite a few like jane i know she is from singapore   yeah from singapore    and jenny and jessie   jessie    jenny or jessie  jenny i think is jenny hong kong fashion week is coming soon   are you doing it now  yes   yeah  but actually nobody knows uh how many show   oh really  yeah will will do but actually i know that tdc total they have seven shows but i don't know how many shows i ' m going to do or may be four or five   yeah models and one-word have called me and ask me if uhm karen remember karen in the states  uhm uhm   brown hair  aw   you know  yeah   but i think that if she was going come back and they want her telephone number but she got married in october so i think she is now she ' s coming back  which karen i can't remember    brown   because there ' s two karen   i haven't i don't manage  uhm brown hair i think not not i met karen when a long time she ' s only here for a short time  i remember two karen uh may be i mix it up  i can't remember which one    yeah  she was here anyway  she was new   yeah she was new last year she just one-word last year really  they are flying in three models from milan   oh yeah  yes tdc   do you know who  i don't know who one is chinese i just know that one is chinese and twelve models are from china    one is chinese  and twelve models are from china one-word    yes  you know e each show because you know tdc ' s fashion show is really big each show they have twenty-seven models   oh yeah  yeah   almost no guys can get in very few  i think yeah very few guys in the show    yeah  not not too much actually for the guys the hong kong market is not so good for the guys i think so   not too good though for shows like i mean like tdc their very few things like tdc  actually tdc is not that prestig    prestigious  yeah as before    yeah  they don't pay that well right  it ' s okay the payment is okay but i think for for the prestigious is not so doesn't like as before because before may be two years or three years ago if you do the tdc show it ' s wow    oh is  great huh  yeah it ' s great but now is   no big deal  uhm uhm   yeah uh well somebody told me last time as they were complaining the money they said oh it ' s not so good  you know why  we we did the summer fashion week and anna is the  choreographer  she suppose from the schedule they said we have to work four hours for the rehearsal but anna make it up to eight hours    why   right ]  yeah  oh uh double the time you two-words   she didn't know what she should do for the rehearsal but actually we ' ve been crazy for her yeah   there ' s not as many shows now as you used to be there used to be more shows  i think this year is very busy   yeah  yeah for me is very busy this year because pacific place landmark total is already twenty something fashion shows   oh right yeah i didn't do either one of those shows may be that ' s why seem like you do a few like   and i think the coming year ninety-five they still have the pacific place fashion show in spring and summer and landmark as well i think landmark is richard doing it   oh it ' s richard doing ninety-five   yeah yeah yeah  and pacific place is still alan bailey   what about uh lane crawford  lane crawford is alan bailey  i think so     oh that ' s him  alan bailey will do one tdc show this year   oh yeah  yes   uh i just didn't do as many shows this year  what   i didn't do as many show this year as i did in the past  just just doing the film so forth   that ' s okay you make a lot of money  yeah   but and when you begin in the beginning they never pay you a lot of money until you become a little bit well known no even like michael in the beginning the money wasn't so as good but now     but now  now is much better yeah  that ' s good     it ' s much better because he has become well known people want him  i think he ' s change her uh his image for me he changes image   from what to what  a little bit    how did he change   now he ' s become more mature before he ' s quite young and     and crazy  yes   yeah yeah he has changed once you get married and you have kids you change anyway   it ' s  yeah but its nice change    yeah   nice change   good for him i think  yes suit the hong kong market much more   yeah but you have to go to see his latest movie   which one     one-word he plays the  one-word and   oh did the company won    the company won  he ' s got long hair i mean he ' s like a-few-words hair it ' s not this   i mean his hair was long it was longer than yours when he got it cut   okay   th aw   not this  yeah   yeah  really    yeah   last time i met her when i did the hong kong  fda fashion show and i saw his hair is not that long may be after that longer   yeah about as long as your may be a little longer   because he he got the ten best dress in town you know that i watch     i i i saw that i mean but i don't understand because he always wears jeans and tennis shoes anyway it ' s okay  i gave him lots of clothes   yeah   may be the style     esprit gave him clothes nautica gave him clothes replay gave him clothes  who else   uhm who else i don't know i know those three  how about harley davidson he got one harley harley davidson motorbike   yeah but they don't give him clothes he has to buys those  yeah   now have he sold his old bycic motorcycle and bought a new one  which one  still harley davidson     he bought a harley davidson  yeah a big red it ' s a big road king  wow   hugh it ' s really big  but its very hard to control   it it not really  not really for me i     no  once you know how then it ' s okay  because very heavy for me it looks very hard to     have you tried to  oh looks very heavy  yeah and then i think it ' s very hard to control   in in the beginning yeah it is they are quite heavy but it ' s once you learn how to sit on it with balance and so forth you know it ' s like anything in the beginning you know its difficult  uhm uhm   once you learn how to do it  it gets easier   yes a-few-words  oh the red one now he got the red one     yeah  all big red  now a overlaps with z's unclear speech he only got the motor bike to   and a car  and a car vitarra because   saab he ' s he sold the jeep   viterra   yeah     yeah

it in the newspaper just before after  one-word look who it ' s over there alan beatty  oh hi alan do you work with alan before   yes i work with him a long time ago one of the first i came here for the show david and i david lim and i and we did uhm the show but it was doing some walking steps that we kind of very flighty you know a bit too flighty and we buck we didn't want to do those and somehow he overheard us made the comment from me i think maybe i wasn't saying anything about him just the steps but i don't he never like me after that for a long time he never book me for a show never ever than finally dunhill  dunhill the dunhill is really nice   yeah dunhill booked me because they always book me full show and he was doing that and so i work with him again and then i think he liked after that i guess cos he knows i ' m you know when i do a show i don't miss out i ' m always there all the time and i don't mess around and so he the like me then he choose me a few times since then uhm uhm uhm uhm then when are you going to china again for the modelling   we ' re supposed to go to china on the fifteenth of december but i think it ' s going to be postponed for a little while many be like one week last time i ask you did they cancel the goldlion show because i heard it from from some people who say that they are running in the uh garment field so that ' s why they said they the goldlion show must be cancelled and i say it and i just told them it ' s it is impossible because i heard most of my friends are going to china for the goldlion show    one-word did some right  uhm uhm   did they said the second show will going to be cancelled though  if   no   suppo i think is the first one     all of them  the first one yeah  now very successful   the first one  very successful   yeah the client is really happy  uhm uhm   mr bolmill himself and all of his whatever his name is i can't remember and uhm all of his the areas that we went to like in harbin very good turned up of people and very good uhm response and we went to the hangzhou and people from the shop in suzhou came to hangzhou for the show and now they ' ve been crying cos they want the show to come to suzhou they said it ' s no fair it ' s fair why go there for the show we don't have the show and they ' re opening up some new shops in the city and they want us to uhm to do the show at the same time they open up the new shops  uhm that ' s good because now i ' m running the advertising business so i know image for for the product that the product image in china is very important    yeah   if they they do this kind of things to maintain their image must have very good business   yeah yeah we uhm i guess they introduce this as world famous models right come all over you know cos we ' ve people from australia from   from england from america from japan form singapore from you know all over   yeah  that ' s right i think so     so and then the three girls they book from shanghai  a-few-words the money  yeah  the rate the rate is     the   the rate for the chinese models from shanghai is even it ' s the rate is higher in beijing the models from beijing they get paid more money if they come from shanghai they get less money  why   i don't know i don't know but that ' s what they told the girls all this  may be the system   the girls in yeah the girls in beijing get more money quite a bit more money than the girls from shanghai the girls from shanghai get paid very low  yes   it ' s per show i don't know how much they got paid for what we did because we were gone but they get paid for normally for a show they get paid two hundred renminbi   well really not renminbi right two hundred yuan and at the agency or the state whoever keeps one hundred they get one hundred  but do they have a salary   i don't think so   each month    i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that i didn't ask that i just we didn't ask how much about how much they get paid for the show  but i heard there ' s some people some models they do working as a freelance in china uh such as shanghai or beijing they can get the same rate in hong kong   the chinese models  chinese models   from china  from china   uh i don't know  and the market is much bigger than hong kong ' s market is not so big but as long as if the economic is good more fashion show    well  right there is more here because the economy is bigger here than in china you mean the market in china is going to be very big right now it ' s it ' s still small cos of half for the long or you know  so my boss is actually since last month my boss went to shanghai and guangzhou once a week because   once every week  yeah you know why because my boss is going to set up his office in shanghai and guangzhou   yup an advertising agency in both cities   yes yes  so that ' why he very busy   how many people work at your company  twelve   twelve so  a medium size   no  but not the is quite good i like the creative in this company  because you know uhm most of the advertising company uhm they are for the graphic size are quite strong but our company is but they lack of fashion sense    creative team  yeah  yeah but all my company the the one i work with now they are quite strong in graphic but but there ' s one more thing they take the advantage is they do have the sense so that ' s why     of fashion  yeah of fashion so that ' s why you know advertisement is art of communication from my point of view   uhm uhm  and we ' ve more fashion sense and then the quality will be much better   what what have you guys done do you do a lot for television or do more print work  both   in advertising both  both uh the new one just coming up is the australian sport shoes   australian sport shoes
