  so david is in is in moscow  yes yes he ' s he ' s part of this chess team so anyway but ann ma will be there   okay  and is i think they ' ve given us the room number one one yes one one o one at first she said maybe she can go and meet us at the front entrance but i said no i mean i think we can find our own way but we i think we should go in through the bonham road  entrance because it ' s closer  i mean that is the what something like the fourteenth floor  i may go down    okay  oh yeah yeah yeah yeah   i mean its got i mean  they got funny floor numbers anyway  yeah so but anyway so it ' s nine o'clock  maybe we should just yeah we just meet  in the room yeah  i have to leave home especially early i mean to get there at nine  by nine but that ' s that ' s okay right so i ' ve got the booklist ready for them i mean david said there will be sixteen or seventeen people i ' ve got twenty ueo booklist to take along because he said some of the lecturers may want a copy yes but actually somebody called me as school teacher and say we ' ve got these twelve copies but can we get more complementary copies for our student i told her to go and buy them    right   right   several words   yeah   okay okay two words   okay  uhm i think that ' s fair enough i mean you know a  one word photocopy uhm you know   yeah so i said  yeah i mean i didn't told her to photocopy but i mean i don't know if the copyright thing is on it   on the booklet     i think we ' ve but we ' ve said we ' ve said  they can make as many copies as they want   oh okay   they have photocopies  oh one word  but anyway i said they are available as three dollars a copy from san po kong if the students want to get the   personal copies because we said we can only afford twelve complementary   copies per school  so yeah so anyway we ' ll give away these twenty  booklets if the lecturers want them  you know so so david told me last time when he call is they want to talk about these changes in the uh ue oral so updating them    yes   right   yeah   one word  and do they want  uh i mean do they want specifically  i mean it is supposed to be about ue or it ' s supposed to be about anything cause uh a i know there ' s a question of combination of the new  syllabus   yeah no  i think it ' s going to be about anything see because david said oh it ' s is a section of public exams so anything about public exams  so i think is these are questions that people just you know thought of and they    okay   okay  it ' s being a witch actually john ducan call me this morning to say that he ' s doing a section on friday about the new ce oral  oh so soon   and he  has he got the book out for   no no i mean he ' s doing it for ile for their te the teachers that are and i think is the same teacher to tell you the truth it sound alike cause he said something about i noticed you could be up there on  thursday   oh i see  so it ' s the same group of people   i think it may be the same but uhm   so maybe we shouldn't tried to say so  much about     and he wanted to know you know because he said he said  no no he wanted to know about the exam cause he said he didn't know anything about the exam   what we ' re going to say   oh  do you think these people will ask about the exam then and shall we answer questions about them because otherwise david  is it david bunton or  john ducan right  so is he going to have these question     no no no john du   or may we should call him back in friday exactly if he ' s gonna to be with the same one cause of the years  yes   then what  i have told him is basically   yes  uhm did you send him the sample papers   no he said he already have that  he has the sample paper and he has the syllabus and he has the he said he had several the textbooks that will come out   alright right  right or i thought john has written a textbook when he know he ' s done one of the ue oral     i don't think he  he did one for the ue  but i don't think he ' s still done two words  oh i see but is so he is doing it for as a lecturer there see because he use he didn't teach before did he he was in charge of   in charge of the ae i think he still is i mean but i think maybe sometimes it does  in possession  so i ' m not sure  maybe we should call him this afternoon and just  find out   ae yeah   oh oh i see   right   okay   right  and check with him yes  okay because we don't want to be saying you know the same thing   right  right okay so but anyway i mean so it ' s it ' s actually uh david ' s suggestion that we should talk about the ue oral because he said that you know most teachers are interested in it because it ' s a new exam i mean i expect maybe actually questions on the new ninety-six syllabus as well but i mean some of these teachers might have actually already gone to the you know seminars or or you know terry and lowe sessions right so anyway i mean he said it ' s up to us if we want to start by talking about the ue oral giving out those booklists and then just maybe i thought you know since it ' s it ' s already the second year of the exam so if we just may be highlight the the changes you know like the the pregrouping and may be clarify that bit about using formulate it    okay   oh one of the sem   okay  yes that ' s  it means that ' s  right   yeah in fact one of the questions here is about grouping    is about the ue oral  oh okay   good  oh they were these they they talk about this problem with grouping  right     yeah but i ' m letting the whether senior supervisor class the kids do   the the friends yeah  the grouping  okay  right that ' s these question here   some candidates complain that the waiting room supervisor did not help in the grouping of candidates he ask the candidates to form their own group i bet it ' s a lie check  has the year heard of this okay so then we i mean as a response to these question i suppose    so   uhm  yeah so i mean one of the thing we can talk about this is is the fact they gonna be they gonna be grouped by computer  uhm   okay and then  uhm   shall we talk about the also about the memorize the fact that we gonna try to standardize one word     right  yes because i i think that was one of the major concerns remember the section we did uh at the ioe some time ago was it a half that was after the exam already the section we did with all these people arguing about whether we should make content part of the marking     oh yeah what it was because because they have heard from about the chief exam  right okay yes so anyway uhm  so should we do it like you know by question you know following these questions or should we just  let say if we group all the questions about the ue oral  together and say these were questions that people ask and here are our answers and then actually say you know a lot of their answer can be found in this new blue booklet and then maybe give each person a copy   so maybe the first bit will be ue oral anyway so any questions that i hear on ue on the ue oral and then afterwards we can look at the other questions   i don't know how long this going to take it ' s an hour and twenty minutes input from you based on submitted questions  it depends on how many questions they ' ve got see so you    especially   yeah   right   yeah yeah   okay   okay  but we also i think we should probably open questions from the floor as well cause it probably gonna be people who will have being examiners   uhm   uhm  right so actually what we can do is actually say how i mean see how long it takes anyway we ' ll concentrate on the ue oral to begin with and you know give give all the information we can about it answer all the question that i hear and then say do you have any other questions on the ue oral   uhm  and then aim at finishing before the break   at ten twenty and then after the break we can talk about these other questions you know about the listening test or paper four oh one word this is paper four is oral     uhm   yes yes yes it ' s okay  right  and ce language exams yes so that will be after the break so is one hour and twenty minutes and then a twenty minute break and then i suppose another hour and twenty minutes once she said twelve i think   okay  right  yeah alright so let ' s ue oral let ' s see what questions they ' ve got  this is listening test  alright so this is about the listening uh about the  two words oral  right then we can actually cut this out and then clip that together yes that ' s easier than so anyway this question is about will marks be deducted if a candidate tries to make a summary at the end of the group discussion we never said anything about summarizing people are summarizing so may be sort of plays  group leader makes a conclusion yes sometimes teachers have these strange ideas     how about three words why don't i just    we can actually use   no i mean i don't think that ' s at all i mean   right   but they won't also be  they won't ou you know automatically get credit for that easily you know it ' s not uh necessary uh well i mean actually maybe we should say something that might affect that that   uh have credit   yes  uhm   that that a lot of language school and these tutorial schools actually gram has got  someone call him on the day who teaches private privately and he ' s come up with this check list of things  he is given to his students   uhm  so he ' s from a tutorial school   i think he might be from a tutorial school  and he wanted gram to comment on these and in fact the check list is actually quite good i mean it you know it it draws the students ' attention on all sort of things   right  right   but i think and i think in fact it is not a bad thing at all for a student to have but but the thing is they should they have to realize that  the the actual awarding of points is not gonna be by  this check list and then you know if they get  if they do all these things they ' re not gonna necessarily get the highest mark i mean similarly that if they if they summarize at the end  it doesn't necessarily mean they gonna get higher marks and there ' re no formulas   uhm   uhm  right but i mean he doesn't say anything about like putting in the last word   no no no no it ' s not like that it ' s not like that   it ' s not like that  okay now as level use of english these are all questions about you know the grouping of candidates the evaluation report of the ue exam i think they mean the annual report well will it be publish when and such feedback will be invaluable to all of us if there ' s report will there be any seminars on it   oh we do have i mean the report is out there  uhm but have the schools got them   no no  we ' ve got them i think   we can said yeah we have we can  shall we bring along a copy then     shall we call a card  or shall we make a photocopy of the one of  yes why don we okay so we take along the ur oral booklist and then ued   or it could be even ue couldn't it i mean could be the whole or   examination report  okay but if could i mean it ' s is quite a lot   is it  you see how many pages  we ' ve got  so give each person a copy i think each school gets a complementary copy but i get i mean sometimes the the book gets circulated and i  and nobody knows where it ends up is it the ninety four report   yeah  if it is not too many pages you can ask joanne to make a copy it ' s actually quite long   yes  twenty pages and if you did it and that there ' ll be ten pages  if you did back to back it could be fine right   like that that ' s ten papers  yeah why don we give it to them then   yeah  i mean since they ask so   there ' s only twenty copies  yes or actually less than that i think let ' s make eighteen copies because there ' re there ' ll only be sixteen to seventeen  teachers     okay  okay  yes yes if we make eighteen copies we are quite safe okay so ue  ue examiner ' s reports we ' ll bring along eighteen copies  okay so here here are all questions about the uh oral performance about appeal i mean look at the last question i think is about what if they ' re not happy with their performance     oh can they appeal  can they appeal   well i mean answer is yes they can but not really can be done  uhm  but i suppose  we can't tell them about the new  you know procedures we are following because that ' s not confirmed yet you know about  i mean don't it like the ue compo  you know the discrepancy candidate  discrepancy strips i don't know    you know   oh right right right right right right i mean has that been decided  no i mean nobody ' s i mean   i haven't hearding him more about it actual    yeah  everybody was talking about it at the so meeting and then afterwards you know there was this strong objection and we put it in a minute actually oh you weren't here when when we had those meeting yes actually i mean uhm  thomas made i i took the minutes at that meeting and thomas make you know make it very clear that he wants me to incorporate those objections in the minutes so it would be you know for the records  so anyway but then and then rest came up with these other idea right or doing the discrepancy and i i don't know what ' s happening now so i suppose we shouldn't tell them until it ' s is two words that ' s okay this is about the listening tests this is about the validity of the oral exam this is a very general question    right   no   right   no i think yeah  yeah i read that uhm  well i mean the business about personality and things i mean we have talked about in terms of  the fact that we simply accept the fact that personality is part of communication and therefore it ' s you know  but in term of things like appearance school background racial background and such as i mean   uhm   uhm  well i think all we can do is tell examiners you know to try   but but we don't one word   i mean we don't explicitly say  you know don't pay attention to what they ' re wearing because you assume that they wore i mean you know   but is   but we would   say   that ' s that ' s what ' s examiners should do  i think actually if you tell them if actually draw their attention yes     then you draw their attention  yeah i agree  i mean for example some examiners may think all girls are always better boys with spoken english and there ' s nothing you can do to really stop that even if you say you know try not to discriminate against the boys they will do the same thing anyway    yeah  uhm  i mean the thing is i think it is possible that people do discriminate about  subconsciously for things like like dress  it ' s like it ' s uh one is like you know    like handwriting   you know you do   uhm   uhm   or hairstyle   yeah it ' s like  there ' s uhm   and my own feeling about answering a question like this  is it is best although whole business about personality is is the best just to be honest and say yes we do admit that it  it is possible  you know and that we   that it ' s a factor   right  because i ' m and anyway i don't think you can really get rid of those  factors     right  right  if you have human i mean you know if you have human  examiners then you can't get rid of those  right    uhm   right right  okay so it all about the oral  yes this is all about the oral there ' s one more question about the  use of english this is about listening  i mean we can stick it on at the end maybe i mean so these are all oral why don't we put it at the end and just put listening it ' s it ' s really quite a minor question you know we ' ll  $z sneezes about spelling mistakes i really don't know we ' ll have to ask gram  i think it depends on the nature of the mistake because i remember before they say that if the you know if the spelling mistake changes the meaning of the word  or if it ' s so unrecognizable then you don't give it a mark  but if it ' s just you know one l missing or something  else  and if it ' s still recognizable then you give it the mark so actually it depends on the requirement of the task again  it differs from year to year yes  so this is listening one isolated question about the listening  and these are all oral questions  uhm  then there are some questions on the ce so i think so that ' s the first bit of it right talking about all those questions and then talking about the booklet     oh sorry   changes the meaning of the word   right   it differs from year to year as well   okay   right and then we want to talk about  okay the grouping by computer will talk when we address that question  standardizing memorize speech   uhm uhm  so we ' ll say actually that they there will be a film and so and all examiners will be retrained and they will all watch it exam     okay actually that that might be a general thing we should say is  uhm so i i mean it ' s good for standardizing anyway they they may get a bit bored with the film i mean if they do it for several years   what if we said i mean we know we talk at one point about having an old exams come and now later is   later  i think they still can i mean so so they maybe they don't have to come  that ' s why we didn't we didn't want to specify the phone yet but i think if they leave the three hours open for the  meeting and if they we say oh instead of coming four thirty  we come at five thirty they always can come but if you just say pm they would say oh i can't come in the afternoon because i don't finish till three o'clock  then nobody will choose the pm session   so i think is important to put four thirty so they know they can come after school  but if they are required to come only at five thirty  that is still okay    that ' s why we said   we we just put am and pm and then you change that   oh yeah sure several words   yeah right right   right right   yeah   right   right  uhm  yeah i think in the training then maybe if we i mean again we shouldn't be definite about this because we are not sure what we will do but  i think if if at the beginning we show them the procedures that you see because i think the old examiners their experience one would all know early know about you know panic getting the score sheet for each person and you know what to do with the folders how to fill things in like that so they don't really have to go through that  so maybe this year what we do is actually show them the procedures film first to all the new people and then by ten o'clock you know maybe we start at nine then by ten o'clock everybody ' s there then you show the standardization film    right right right   right   yeah   two words standardization  yeah  but i mean we can also say you know if you want to revise that bit of it you can come at nine thirty but just say you know but i think but then signing in could be a problem  because if you are doing that you know people will be coming in unless you set up a table outside and then joanne or eliza  can stand  you know    uhm uhm  would it be  or if you have a break    well would it would it be worthwhile to have everybody come at  nine o'clock i mean have the old rooms do something different like actually talk about some i mean a bit like two words talk about or suggestion or ideas or whatever  but is a bit late with suggestion and ideas because  that was   the same time   experience sharing or something like that   uhm uhm   yes  right  la i mean certainly it makes life easier for us if they all come at the same time  because then i mean  see because attendance is the key thing  they can't work as examiners unless they ' ve come to the training session and we want to make sure that you know everybody goes to the training session so if they all sign in at the same time     uhm   uhm   yeah right   right  yeah several words  maybe they don't mind watching the procedures with begin
