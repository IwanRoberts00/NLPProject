 i like the new hall so much    uhm  really how come  very beautiful   really   yah i think it ' s be much more beautiful than ho tung  and  it ' s seems that more comfortable and more free than wei lun   is it is it for uhm girls only or is it co-edu   no no   co-edu    co-edu   yah   yeah    did you apply for it  if you ' re freshman would you apply here or apply  the new one  uhm  but but i feel it is very risky because if i want to apply for the new hall i need to quit this hall first but if i fail to apply the new hall then i have no hall to live    this hall  you couldn't apply for the student flats and hall  but student flats only for those who live so remote  yeah  far away yah    one-word hall too  yah i know uhm wh uh those who lived in the student flat are mainly lives in uh sheung shui lo wu yah something like that yeah   yes   and it ' s very difficult to enter student flat yah but i think u hall is much better so i ' m in a dilemma now   but i think uh for the new hall that it may not necessarily be more free because it is still under the hall system so they they are actually not too sure whether or not it ' s going to be like this one  but it is a new one and it had no tradition so i think it may be more free   yeah  uh that ' s not i ' m well can we trying to pretend to be freshmen and have a hall tour to the new hall i i i i will try yah are there uh many people apply for this one   i think so  many of my classmate in bba apply for this one how about ho tung i don't know but   i uh i think for hoh dung the name of a dormitory of the university of hong kong it will be the people who are actually affiliated members i think he will apply for it to the because they ' re guaranteed in sport  uh uh but i think several hundred girls live in the same hall so terrible   but then you look at ricci and u hall and several hundred boys living in the same hall so it ' s not the same problem  but for for for ricci it has only about ninety boys but for ho tung we have five hundred girls  but   they ' re the oldest one     oh it ' s good for the ricci boys then  but the girl uh the the boys uhm may not gossip with each other yeah uhm how they   what what do you mean  yah yah uh mosquito boys talk less frequently about the others    i was one-word for a while  i think it depends which group of boys you ' re talking about because someone can be gossipy uhm but anyway uh what do you do over easter holiday   uh  uhm uh uh uhm i ' ve back to home  but  are you really afraid to quit to be quit yeah   why do you say that  i don't know why just afraid afraid yeah are you afraid   no  you won't be quit yah i think so too   because it ' s not that easy to get quit quitted   really   but then it seem    it ' s not that easy  how many peoples were quit last year   only people who really do not contribute to hall or who didn't do a thing or who are really hated by their floor-mates  yes  what do you mean by not contribute to hall   not playing any sports games and cultural  the who wants     uhm  basically for hall the things that they count for when they re-admit you is whether or not you pay your hall fees on time  uh uh   whether or not that ' s not you whether or not you play a part on your floor like were you responsible for everything whether or not you uhm took part in their activities whether or not you attend their meetings high-table dinners it ' s not just based on how much you contribute it ' s based on a lot of factors so it ' s not that easy to get kicked out so don't be scared as i ' m pretty sure they don't kick you out   uh uh  i think the most important thing is to live in harmony with our floor-mate cos you know ken ling   yeah i do   uhm uhm  he told me that uhm wei lun guys does not have hall spirit but their floor spirit is very strong so if you live in harmony with your floor-mate you won't be quit   i think the most important part is to get along you get along with the head of your floor  you get along with your head then you ' re fine   uh     honest   are you in the group uh with ken ling you mean o camp yah no no i mean he ' s not anyway but i know him before i enter wei lun hall secondary school no no no no no i i i know him in one-word day   oh oh   oh  yeah do you really remember those who guides you to the hall tour yes  yah     what did you think did what did you think of the hall when you first saw it   uhm uhm  uhm what i think   did you like it  uhm i like it because it is very new compare to compare to swire and st john    oh  but it ' s not new anymore yes because we have a new hall uh uh yah actually i ' m i like sky more than this hall yeah but sky is very harsh uhm may be i can say that uhm it ' s more convenient   oh for you because you go to school on the main campus   yah  but uhm it ' s only uhm my perception before i enter the hall  aw but now i think i like new the new hall much more so will you apply for it i don't think so i think it ' s not so good for you to quit a hall and jump to another hall   yes    because they actually look at your application and to see to see which halls you admitted before and it will be harder for you to uhm re-accepted   but uhm but will the warden notice that you admit another hall   i ' m not sure i ' m not sure i just know it ' s harder to get in  harder   because they ' ve already accepted you into this hall so they ' re going to ask why you are you moving to another hall   yah   and it is very difficult to answer but uhm but uh does the new hall want to recruit someone who is really good at sports or cultural uhm yah for for uhm existing hall-mates uhm they can guarantee that uhm they can contribute to the new hall what do you mean yah because they involve they can see their involvement in their hall teams and to see that whether this person will is willing to contribute to the new hall or not you mean you mean they want to recruit some some some student who are very very outstanding in sport  yah  i think if they ' re very very outstanding in sport they may quit the existing hall and apply for the new hall and the new hall will accept their application yeah  only if you ' re very good at sport  but    i think you have to look into what the criteria for acceptance is entering new hall  is the same for all the halls at u   then it ' s quite easy to be accepted  yeah is the priority given to to those who haven't get a place at hall  i think so    yeah  will you think that uhm there is someone who would like to apply this the c for current student i mean   i think so i i actually knows students who want to apply  year one year two   yeah one  year one   because they don't like their current hall so they want to move to a new one because with the new one because there are no traditions you are there for in charge of uh dictating what you feel like a hall should be like whereas you put the other halls you don't have uhm that freedom because of peer pressure etcetera from   and will there be anyone who would like to apply wei lun this year uhm i guess not some freshmen   i think medical students might because it ' s closed  to the medical school like uhm all three halls at sassoon road are on the medical campus so that ' s why a lot of medical students apply here   yeah yeah yah  yah   i mean if you are a medical student would you apply for this hall or other halls  i think uh the new hall yah much more beautiful i think they have sea views the two halls have sea views   oh  sea view are you sure i think so   do they go that high  but there is some private housing surround  surround   it ' s it ' s down the hill but  down hill but behind the two halls are the ricci halls which are quite low in height i think just what i think i ' m not sure uh how ' s your leg my leg was beaten by mosquito   oh doesn't matter doesn't mind all over the place   see  uh    but this is really a big bug i ' ve i ' ve   a few words  but there ' s no mosquitoes in my room   there aren't any   there ' s a big mosquito uh  where it is   yeah it lives in this room it refuses to leave the mosquito  will you live in the same room next year   i don't know  have to see   are you too  how to how to choose room how to choose the room next year   uhm it ' s by raffle so basically you put down your top three choices of your room and that they draw and then if you it ' s it ' s just by random   just by random  oh    it ' s like they go for each room and they put in their names and then they the first person they draw out if it ' s you you get it if it ' s not then  oh i see how about if all the three choice uhm cannot be get   i ' m not sure what will happen then but usually it ' s alright  uh huh   usually things work out are you worry about that  no because but but i don't want to move my belongings to another room yah i think i think it ' s troublesome    oh  very very troublesome   yah so that ' s why i would like to apply for summer residence   oh why don't you  i i think so i ' m not decided yet   okay   yeah     but i thought the deadline already passed   #> really   the sixteenth wasn't it the sixteenth  i don't know uh   i think the deadline had already passed  yah have you applied   yes i have  how about you your belongings uhm my my father will help me to take all of them back i think it ' s very troublesome   i agree tape stops and restarts  very terrible and i can't wear dress in the summer   oh it ' s okay just say that it ' s a it ' s a raw wound wild wound when will you when will you can wear dress when yeah in winter  win  i can wear boot i can't wear dress in the summer never mind are you busy now   yeah i ' ve got an exam in a month  yeah when will your first exam be held   exactly in a month may sixteenth   oh   uh    and you  i don't know twenty-first of may  aw     oh i see  to sixteenth no no no no no uhm tut yeah sixteenth of june   oh i finish on the twenty-third of may  uh   and i ' m going home on june first  oh do you mean you ' ll back to vancouver   yeah i ' ll back   vancouver    yeah  when will you be staying in vancouver   at home  when   when   yeah     when i ' ll be going uhm june first  june first   uhm  till the late august   till the august  uh yeah   yeah  will you have lessons   no  on au august   uhm in the middle of august  oh   because every year they take out two weeks from your vacation yeah can you bought some cds for me   oh yeah what do you want   yah because i ' m i ' m i ' m teaching in uhm teaching ballet in a school but uhm since uhm hong kong the hong kong uh records does not uh contain any uh cds about uhm ballet music i would like to buy some  yeah    oh yeah yeah definitely  yah thank you   welcome what do what do you like to listen to for ballet what do you dance to  uhm i ' ll like     like tchaikovsky  no no no i don't want uhm the the pieces but i would like some uhm some cds especially for ballet class   oh okay you teach ballet  yeah    oh     oh very small girls just very easy steps   how long have you been dancing  how long have i been dancing uhm i think about ten years so yah i ' m not sure uhm uhm  ten years wow    do you want to become a dancer  no of course not  i ' m not so talented in dan dancing  why  but you like dancing so much   yah  really if i really like dancing then i ' ll join the hall dance team but you but you are the the the the hong kong u dance team right yah but how do you feel about the hall dance team  uhm    interesting  interesting   and you  have you joined it last year   no no  have you i have join but i haven't attend why it seems that there ' re there are so li uh so few people joining the dance team yes   i think it ' s because they demand they have very demanding practices  but i think one word is much more demanding than choir yeah a few words  do you think so   uhm not really depends i think it depends how committed you are  because if you are committed to it then it shouldn't be matter how many practices there are because if you want to do it then you will make time to do it but if you don't really want to do it then there is not point for you to join because then it is you don't put your heart into it and then it ' s one-word   uh   uhm uhm   is a laser jet   yes it ' s a laser jet  yah how much is it   two thousand  so cheap   really   not really     is that   isn't isn't it ' s not quite  expensive for a laser jet   but   for   two thousand for   laser jet is is about two thousand yah i think it ' s it ' s alright    oh yes yes  really okay   yeah yeah but it ' s better   it ' s faster  yah faster for ink jet it ' s very very slow yah and it cost several hundred dollars yeah   yeah yeah the the cartilage is uhm expensive but it lasts for like fifteen hundred sheets so it ' s it ' s quite worth there  aw uh uh     yeah  how much is the cartilage   uhm mine was given to me with the printer so i don't know how much it costs   uhm  uh huh   do you have a printer in your room  yah ink jet     what kind  ink jet  yah   is it slow  yah very slow yah the the epson would have the promotion at wei lun hall and i bought this   yes they have   and it cost five hundred  dollars     oh   yah five hundred dollars i think it ' s cheap so that i bought it   oh i had that one i still have it but i don't use it because it died on me that ' s why i have that  but i think epson is not good epson is good   it ' s good but just not that model   i  i don't think so because i have another model at home and is which always out of order and for this one it has also out of order and i  which model is it at your home home   stylus three hundred   yes it ' s very it ' s very old one two hundred    oh   oh  but but for the tut but the third month after i bought it it has out order   oh  i ' ve yah in the warranty period i have i have sent it to repair for four times or five times  four times    oh really i ' ve never sent my printer to repair i just hit it and it fixed it itself cos i ' m too lazy  i use hp at home and it is not very  several words i think wil will it    no   hp  i think cannon is good i think hp is   yeah and it ' s very small   yeah   very expen     it ' s fast  what is it sensation conscious unconscious   oh it ' s it ' s my study they ' re my studying charts  yeah   so when i go   are you learning the brain   yes yes the brain the central nervous system and then uhm the female reproduction cycle and then the kidney function and then uhm  sex determination   but  but i think humans do not know much about the brain   they do  they do   they do  yeah   they know a lot why do you think they don't know a lot  yeah because human only use less a only a little part of the brain is it really   oh you sue a lot of it you you use the whole brain when you think  and when you do thing   use the whole brain  we have only use about yah five percent yah   but you need all those parts to to do </[ do this   you mean all those parts are working  together    yeah yeah  but what does it mean only five percent the the the capacity of our brain is very large   yes  but but we ' ve only used about five percent   all right so you ' re saying that we have the potential to use   it or   yeah yeah yeah the potential uh uh   i see  do you feel cold   no  feel cold    do you   yah  actually i ' m not but i ' m just asking because all the other rooms haven't   oh it ' s it ' s because i ' m not used to the heat so i need to turn on the air con   switch on the air con  oh vancouver is much colder   it ' s very cold it ' s it ' s   uhm but it is summer now   it ' s dry and here is very humid  yeah   so the air con keeps it uhm dry  how do you live when in last year when there ' s no air-conditioner   uhm i lived in the library because there is enough conditioning for sleeping   no oh when i slept i turned on the fan to max and i opened the windows needless to say i got bitten by many mosquitoes so   can it be enough   uhm it can be it can be because at night it ' s a little bit cooler do you have the air con on in your room  yeah   yes do you think it ' s better with the air con on  yeah i think so  even though i ' m feel a little bit cold i  still turn it on i don't like opening the windows yah     i see   yeah   do you get a lot of dust  uh a little bit and many mosquito   oh yeah  but i never feel there is any mosquitoes in my room   because you ' re not facing the mountain we ' re facing the mountain and you ' re facing the podium  uh uh uh   so that ' s why right you d   uhm mountain   like the construction site  oh   so we have a lot of bugs  yah is this room your first choice last year   no  just random   uh my first choice was one five and then this is   oh the biggest one   it ' s actually they ' re all the same size they ' re all the same size it just how you uh arrange your furniture  all the same size   all same size   they said one five is bigger  all same    no it ' s not they because they measure it and it ' s exactly the same size it just that it just how you arrange the furniture because if you look at the way they arrange theirs it ' s very space consuming it ' s i mean it ' s very uhm it doesn't take much space so that ' s because they compact everything it on the periphery of the room but then in these rooms it ' s like you have everything all over the place so they are all the same size  aw then it ' s the second   yes  yeah is there many people choosing one five i think  so     i think either one five or one two  one two    uhm   why    because they ' re about the same size  but all are the same size   yeah but then people think that they ' re bigger because of the layout  aw   yeah tape stops and restarts  kong u better or cu   it depends because the systems are different but then people say that the hong kong u medical programme is better because it it reforms its curriculum so that it ' s more up-to-date with what ' s going on in the world are the two curriculums the same   no they ' re completely different because in chinese university it ' s uhm they teach by topic so you learn anatomy physiology etcetera whereas here we learn here by block uhm by system so it ' s like the heart the kidneys etcetera  aw i see   aw aw aw     so it ' s different  then why do you choose hong kong u instead of cu   because cu is in shatin and then very hot and because you have to hike up a hill every morning and i ' m lazy   and the life and the life in cu is very harsh i think it ' s boring   it ' s very boring    it ' s boring   and   very very hot for you to wait for the school bus  it ' s very boring i hate cu a lot that ' s why i don't choose cu  one-word-   and i think there are many mosquitoes when you waiting the bus   yes cu is to too excluded and also i have family members who went to hong kong u so they told i i guess you can say i have a biased opinion yeah what about you why did you choose hong kong u and not cu or ust or poly u   uhm  yeah because it ' s very person uh the first one is that i like hong kong u much more because i don't like waiting for fifteen minutes uh for the school bus and if you ' re in a hurry then uhm it ' s difficult for you to choose whether you wait for fifteen minutes for the school bus or run to the building  in cu  too far away yeah and then because uh i ' m uh uhm well in fact i ' m choosing cu geography and hong kong u ba and but for cu geography i know a person that i hate very much    aw  so you don't choose cu   so i don't choose cu   oh i see  uhm and and and i also choose hong kong u because hong kong u is very famous
