<I>

i heard that you are japanese right
 
uhm i ' m half japanese
my mother ' s japanese my father ' s chinese 
 uhm 
so how how did they meet each other
 
uh both laugh i don't know in details but uhm my
mother told me that they met uhm in a library in japan 
 in a library in japan
so your father studied in japan
 
yeah 
oh i see so they met in the library
 
yeah very studious 
 laughs well it ' s a kind of uhm typical
romance right
 
typical romance uhm i 
 for for college students or
 
for college student
yeah for for for their a age i think 
 back in the what in the fifties 
 uh huh 
fifties wow 
 
 or sixties i think 
i think should be in the sixties 
sixties oh i see
so uhm did did your mom uh follow your father back to
hong kong
 
uhm no i think they got married in
 japan but 
 uh huh 
 in japan
 
but i ' m but let ' s see 
i was born in hong kong so she she got they got
married in japan 
 but daisy told me that you were born in 
japan no
you were born you were born in hong kong but you went back
to japan for for your study
 
 no in hong kong 
uhm i live here till i was six and then i went
back to japan 
 uh huh 
uh huh 
oh i see
you went back to japan to have your primary school
there
 
 yeah 
uh i s i went to school for from first grade to
eleventh grade 
and then you go to america
 
yeah 
oh i see
oh that ' s just pretty strange because uh you were you were
not born in japan but in hong kong
 
i uhm why do you say it ' s strange 
because uh if uhm your dad and mom were met in 
japan and they got married in japan but why didn't you uhm why
weren't you born in japan
 
that ' s a good question 
$a laughs maybe i ' ll ask them next time 
well yeah because uh you you said that they uh got
married in japan so i think of it ' s quite
natural for you to to be born in japan too 
you know what i mean
 
 uh huh 
 uhm 
i haven't think of it that way 
$a laughs 
okay maybe i ' ll ask them 
oh i see
uh huh so uhm you were born in hong kong so uh that
means uh your your dad and mom uh came back to hong kong
 
to have me
 yeah 
 yeah i see
so why what did your father uh go to japan to have her
 have his college
 
what was he studying 
uhm uhm
 
i think he was studying politics 
oh politics
 
i ' m not i ' m i ' m not really sure 
he said he used to study medicine but he didn't continue and
 and then he went to japan 
oh i see uh that ' s quite funny
 
what about your parents 
well my parents uhm they got a kind of very traditional
romance you see a kind of uh matching
 
uh huh 
uhm
 
is it the kind like uhm they they didn't meet each other until
the night of their wedding their wedding night 
 oh no no no no no 
uhm my grandmother arranged a meeting with uhm i think with
my dad ' s mother so uhm they met each other went out and uhm
well it ' s quite uh traditional you see but uhm when my dad uh
met my mom uhm he was still smoking and uhm he had to quit in order to
marry my mom you see 
 
 because your mother didn't like him
 smoking 
 yep that ' s 
that ' s right so 
yeah he had to quit smoking you know
i i think he ' s been smoking for about ten ten or
something years
 
 laughs 
wow your mom must be really attractive 
oh i think so both laugh 
and uh that ' s why uh my dad has to quit smoking and uh
actually my mom didn't want to marry him a 
uhm in fact my mom didn't want to get married in that age cos
uh she ' s very free and uhm sh 
 
 oh no 
 how old was how old was she when she got married
uhm it ' s about twenty something very young 
and uh she didn't really want to get married at that age
 
uh huh 
uhm she
 
was she working or was studying 
 yeah she is she was working and uh she could
earn her living and uh she she could buy lots of pretty
clothes something like that and she didn't want to be
 uh become a trap 
 
 uh huh 
 become a housewife 
yeah trap by somebody else and uh but my
grandmother warned her that uh if you didn't get married laughs uh
 then uhm i won't i won't let you to stay at home until you
get married you see
and uh so uh she has to she ' s forced to get married i think
 and uh actually uhm at first she ' s she was not
very happy about marriage 
she didn't want to get married you see and uh my dad was
smoking at that moment and uh she hates smoking 
so uhm she asked my dad okay i will marry you only if you quit
 smoking so my dad has to quit smoking because uh my dad ' s mother
 uh really want want wants my dad to get married cos uh she he ' s about
 thirty maybe thirty something cos uh he ' s ten years older than my
mom
 
 oh no 
wow 
so uhm you s you know at that 
during that years uh thirty something is quite old and
uh if you don't get married you ' ll you will become a bachelor or
something laughs 
 so 
 
 uh huh 
 you you ' ll be the leftover laughs 
yeah so uh they get married and uhm uh that ' s why 
uh and my mom had me when she was uh twenty-two something 
 yeah 
 
 twenty two
 wow 
 yeah 
yeah and then uh when she was twenty-three she had my younger
sister and that ' s all
 
two daughters 
and that ' s all
and you are the only child
 
no i have a older brother and a younger brother
i ' m in between i ' m in i ' m in the middle 
 oh i see 
but i heard that i heard that only heard that if you have uh
brothers and you are the only girl in the family you will become
very boyish and uh very i don't know very uh boy-like i think
 two-words 
 
 like a tomboy 
not a tomboy but uhm pretty active just like 
naughty boys
 
naughty boys laughs 
because i ' ve been uh because i have uh some
friends who have uh brothers and uh they are the only girl in the
family and they always fight with their brothers
 
uh huh 
i don't know if if you only have male siblings would uhm
 would affect you that way but i think i ' ve been
really active 
$a laughs since i was really young
i mean i think i ' m a really active person i like to make
people laugh and i like to do things 
i ' m not the kind that like to uhm sit around and read a book
 i like to like see things learn new things and
 do all sorts of stuff uhm 
yeah i guess i ' m on the active side laughs 
 uh huh 
 uh huh 
 uh huh 
oh that ' s 
because uhm i heard that if you are the only girl in the
family you ' ll be very close to your brothers and you will imitate
their actions their behaviour is that so
because uhm the atmosphere is so uhm masculine you see uh
very manly uh very active fightings all the time
 
 uhm 
well fighting all the time is true both laugh 
really
 
we used to fight a lot
i mean the physical kind of he punched me and i
punched him back that kind of type
but uhm uhm i don't well laughs i
forgot what i was going to say both laugh 
i was looking at my brother ' s picture 
 yeah 
oh
 
that ' s my younger brother 
this one
 
yeah 
oh your uh younger brother and how about your elder
brother
 
uhm this two-words with my grandma 
wow
 
he lives in europe right now 
in europe
which city
 
uhm he lives in belgium 
oh that ' s great
 
which city
i i ' m not sure which city he ' s living in 
belgium
so he ' s doing business in belgium or he ' s studying in
belgium
 
uhm he he ' s a businessman
he ' s working 
oh i see uh huh
but your grandma looks like a chinese
 
uhm yes
she ' s my she ' s my chinese grandma 
oh i see
that means your your dad ' s mom
 
right 
uh huh
that ' s why i i think uh she really looks like a
chinese rather than a japanese 
 
 she she is chinese 
uh huh so uhm when you communicate uh so but your 
your brothers can speak uh cantonese
 
uh huh
 he speaks he speaks uhm dutch english 
and chinese 
 uhm 
wow three language trilingual
uh huh
 
he he doesn't he doesn't speak j japanese 
fluently as uhm my brother and i because he he
sort of uhm grew up separate separately with from us
because uhm he went to school i think he went to school in europe when he was
 really young 
 uh huh 
 uh 
oh i see 
so uhm he has his education in belgium that ' s why uhm 
he speaks less fluently than you and your younger
brother
 
 yeah 
i guess i guess that ' s the reason 
uhm we forgot something break-in-recording 
okay
 
so what are your plans after you graduate 
well uh actually i didn't think about it seriously 
really 
really i didn't think about it seriously 
uhm i myself want to do something in the business field
 uh in the commerce or even pr the public relations 
field 
uh you see uhm i ' m not graduated in the bba department or
 some other economics or finance so i think i may be uhm less
 advantageous than other uh economic or bba students cos 
 i am only doing language courses translation not uh something
about economic or finance
well maybe language is uhm well it ' s good for some business
 because uhm some business will require the applicants with uh 
good language skills uhm uh or acquire some other languages like
uh japanese or french something like that
but uhm that ' s not much for us you see
somebody uhm not somebody uhm many people think that we have a
very good prospectus prospects for translation because uh translation
is getting much popular in hong kong now
but uhm i don't agree with them because uhm you can see from
the outside reaction from the employers that uhm that ' s not 
there ' s not a very big demand for translation students
besides we are not the only translation graduates in hong kong
 uh there are also uh some graduates from polytechnics
 and they are popular
they are more popular than us because uh their courses their
syllabus is more practical than those in the hong kong u
that ' s why the employers will uhm think they are more capable
than us
 
 uh huh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh huh 
how different how different are the courses compared to
well you see uhm
i think uh the first year students in translation this year
 are luckier than us because uh in our first year we did a
lot of uh literary translation which is uh not very practical
indeed
you see no one will uh pay you uh eight thousand dollars
to laughs to uhm for you to uh translate uh three words in
cantonese or some other uh chinese literary works for them 
they will ask you to translate uh journalisms uh journals uh
 newspapers uh some uh telegraphs for them 
that ' s something practical 
we are not doing something practical but rather literary you see
 and that ' s not very good for us because uh we may not be as
competitive as those of uh polytechnics because they did a lot of uh uh
newspapers journals sort of uh practical works you know
 
 uh huh 
 uhm 
but if you did if you practise a lot in translating
literature uhm it won't that be an advantage if you try and look for
a job like for uhm a publisher you know translating uh 
english book into chinese stuff like that
because uhm i know a lady in japan she started out
translating uhm english into japanese for uhm children children ' s
 book 
and then later on she i think all the uhm movies
foreign movies especially american movies they ask
her to uhm translate it for them 
you know you know sometimes they have subtitles 
 in the bottom
this uhm i think she does most of the movies in japan 
 into japanese
english into japanese 
 uh huh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 translate 
 yeah 
 oh 
ah but because uhm because i heard that uhm many
japanese uh do not have a very high level of uh english so
 that ' s why they 
well there are many courses uh english courses for
japanese but uh some people say that they still have some japan
accent or uhm there are not many japanese in japan who can speak
fluent english and write good english is that right 
 
that ' s why uh such kind of uh translators may become very
popular very uhm well demanded by the movie
 
 uhm 
 uh 
 i 
see i i ' m not i ' m not really sure cos i ' ve never been to a
japanese school but this is what i heard from my japanese friends 
 
 uh huh they they take uhm they take english
courses from uhm uhm from seventh grade until 
until they graduate at twelfth grade so that ' s six years of 
education in english but what they study is most of the time is
like they study grammar and uh written english instead of spoken engl
 english so they don't really have a chance to practise
their uhm s their speaking 
 s i think that ' s why they say they when
they speak english they have a weird accent but be 
but uhm when i was in college in in the states uhm a lot of
people that i took classes japanese students they write papers 
better than i did and they they have a wide range of vocabularies
they use 
 uh huh 
 oh i see 
 spoken
uh huh 
 yeah 
because they have more practice in uh written 
english 
 
 written english 
yeah 
well i think so because uh when i was in my 
matriculation uh there was once a a team of uh japanese students
coming to our s to our school
 
exchange student 
yeah and uh just for one-day visit and uh we 
we had to be their host and to bring them around the 
school campus and uh i found that they are they ' re they ' re
 they ' re sort of difficult to express themselves express themselves
clearly i mean
uhm they really want to say something but they didn't know
 what to say how to say it 
uhm they may use some kind of uhm simple words and uh so i
think uh that ' s that may be right they have better written english
 ability than the spoken one 
i think so
 
 uh huh 
uhm uhm
did they try did they bring a dictionary along with them and
try to 
 laughs no
 
try to point out the word they are trying to say 
no no no no
but uh uh actually we asked them to teach us some japanese
words indeed
uhm but i think yes they maybe have a better written
english ability cos they have more practice but uh for
spoken english i think uh maybe they need more practice or
because uhm i think hong kong is an international city you
see so we have to be good in english in order to communicate with 
other people or to compete in the society for jobs
 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
yeah cos like if you watch tv there 
there is the uhm english channel and the chinese channel so like
 you you ' re exposed to more uhm more environment to use 
to lis to even listen to english 
 yeah 
yeah
 
so that ' s good i think 
 i think uh english becomes a basic
requirement of the employers
if you don't know english or you can't uhm write english
or speak english well then you are out of the game cos uh that ' s
the basic the most basic requirement 
you know it is taken for granted that you must know 
uhm or you must write or speak english uh in a very good
level or not very good but in a fair level uh before you can apply
for a job 
 they are still one-word 
 
did they test you 
 did they test you when you apply for a job 
well uhm i just uh had an examination for
the government posts recently 
 
 uh huh 
what kind of examination was it 
oh it ' s exhausting you know
that ' s crazy you know
you can't stand it 
 
 how many hours was it
how many hours 
uhm it starts at about at nine-thirty and it ends
at uhm four-forty and in between there ' s an hour for lunch
 but that ' s too much you know
 
 wow 
what about if you want to go to bathroom 
you just go you you don't have to say anything 
no you can't go out there
you you can't go to the bathroom 
uh you can you have to go to the bathroom uh beforehand
 
beforehand 
yap before you go into the
 
 uhm 
 start the exam 
yeah go into centre to sit for the exam 
and the first part is the use of english 
well i think uh it ' s uh it ' s intelligible-sound one
and a half hour but it it ' s not enough
the time is not enough 
you know the passage is not is not difficult but it ' s
rather it ' s indirect 
its meaning is not directly showing to you y you
know 
you have to think about it 
and uh the most difficult thing is that uh when you
write your answer you have to limit your words 
uh because there ' s a bracket uh writing uhm maybe
twenty-five in the bracket and so your answer should be twenty-five
words or less than twenty-five words
otherwise those uh more than twenty-five words will not be
marked
 
 uhm 
really what kind of questions were they 
 yeah 
uhm about the comprehension 
uh sort of uhm an essay 
 
 so you read a story and they ask you questions
about the story 
yeah
oh 
and you have to find some phrases similar to the meaning
or of some terms
and then you have to fill in the blanks 
and when this paper is over you have about ten minutes 
ten minutes ' rest and uhm people will just go crazily to the
bathroom
 
oh is that like sat
is it similar to sat exam 
uhm sort of i think
and then after you after ten minutes ' rest you have to go
back again and to take the aptitude test
the aptitude test is to test your logic 
and uh but i don't think it can test anybody ' s logic because you
have to finish about uhm sixty sixty questions 
uh it divides into two parts 
the first part have about fifteen questions and
you have uh forty-five minutes for it but don't be so happy because you ' ll
never finish it within that forty-five minutes because that fifteen
questions are very difficult 
and uh you have to read a lot before you can answer and
you have to think a lot before you can answer 
so uhm maybe it requires you about uh two minutes to
do one question but that ' s not enough actually and
then after the forty-five minutes you have to turn to part b and you have
about i don't know how many maybe twenty something uh twenty
graphic and data questions statistics data graphs
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 so it ' s like mathematical 
questions 
 yep not mathematical but uh ya but with
some kind of logic inside
 you have to think about it and uhm actually
it ' s not it ' s totally impossible for us to finish it within that 
time that kind of time because uh that ' s too difficult
and uhm except for those i think i it may be good for
those science students because uhm they can think very fast and uhm
 they can work out an answer very quickly
 
 oh 
uh huh
they i think they are used to uhm with problem-solving 
yeah which is statistics data
 
 because 
yeah they do a lot of math and uhm physics and all that
stuff 
yeah sort of uh calculation and we are the arts
students laughs 
huh i think the last time that i did mathematics is uhm in my
form five 
you know it ' s about five years ago i forgot
everything almost everything and uh i don't think that even if i fail
in this logic test uhm it means that i ' m illogical 
$z laughs 
it doesn't mean that but uhm i think it may be a fair game 
for the science students
you know because uhm they may not be good in writing 
in english so uhm in order to be fair to these science students
they have to make out s such kind of uh logic test 
so uh even they didn't do well in the writing test
 they can do well in the mathematics and the logic test 
and uh so a kind of fair because uh if everything is uhm
 only good for the arts students writing uh composition
 essays comprehension sort of uh writing things uh then it may
be it may become unfair to the science students because they seldom
write essays writings or uhm they will not do sort of a
comprehension but we did a lot of comprehension in our courses
you s you know arts students have to read a lot
 
 uhm 
yeah 
you know so that ' s why it ' s a fair game
and the last part is uhm two questions one in chinese and one
in english you have to answer both 
and uh it ' s about sort of uh situation questions 
you have to maybe write a letter for for some uh chief
commissioner something like that solve the problems
uh they are not real problem but they are realistic
problem 
yeah it may happen in when you work in a government 
and uh that ' s why they have to test about your analytical uhm 
your ability to analyze things you know and to work out a solution a very
quick solution for the problem and you have to write it out 
and i think that part is maybe maybe good for some social
science students because they have to do a lot of uh
problem-solving 
so uh nobody is the most uhm advantageous 
 in in the game
 
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
 oh wow
