good evening and welcome to this week ' s edition of newsline
i ' m sally blythe and with me as usual is political commentator t l
tsim
oh one of the main stories in the news this week were the new
funding proposals for the airport
it ' s the fourth time the proposals have been revised
and this time the government is suggesting it ' d to be prepared to
pump an extra fifteen billion dollars into the project in a bid to try and
 one-word china ' s fears over the level of government
borrowing 
well what remains to be seen is whether china will find this new
proposal acceptable and whether they ' ll be agreeable to the legislative
council
in newsline this week we ' ll be finding out the views of the three
main political parties
joining us now is the representative from the pro-china party the
democratic alliance for betterment of hong kong mr chan yuk fak good evening
 and also spokesman from united democrats of hong
kong albert chan and from the liberal party we have steven poon
 good evening to all 
well first of all perhaps i can address the first question to you
mrchan and ask you what is the reaction of the democratic alliance
betterment of hong kong to these latest proposals 
 one-word 
 good evening good evening 
we don't have any knowledge of the details of the latest
funding proposal
but if you if what is said in the paper of uh injecting uh
additional amount of fifteen billion is true uh 
we think it ' s a move in about right direction and certainly will
narrow the gap of differences and will uh hope uh try to break
the deadlock
 
your views do they actually reflect the views of china 
no i ' m not working for china so i ka i can't 
 say for china 
but well you might say so but i ' m talking on
behalf on dab not for china
 
 but your party has close allegiances with beijing 
uhm albert chan uhm talking on behalf of the united democrats
what is your party ' s reaction to the new set of proposals
i i rather gather you ' re opposed to it
well uh one thing i would like to clarify is that the the new
equity injection is not fifteen billion as mentioned
if if we compare the original proposal put forward by the
government back in nineteen ninety one and that that was the the financial
package which legco had been uh endorsing in in the past
the the new equity injected as proposes by exco is
forty billions
uh that is increasing from twenty billions as in ninety one to
sixty billions in this year
so that means that the people of hong kong in the next few years
have to put in more than forty billions into the airport and airport railway
that means that every hong kong citizen had to contribute more than
seven thousand dollars individually
so the you know this we think we create lots of uh financial
pressure on the government as well as on social services 
 but is that the only reason why your party is
opposed to it
uh is is there another reason why
 uhm 
well one of our main uh concern is the effect on people ' s
livelihood and also we found that for the hong kong government to change the
position uh so drastically you know in in such a short time
you know in the last year and half the hong kong administration
changed the financial proposal three times
you know and i think they are making a joke out of themself
 in uhm you know just because they want to the meet the need or the
demand of the chinese government 
 
 well we ' ll come back and pick you up for a few
these points
let ' s first of all hear the views from the liberal party and
steven poon
do you find now the amount which the government is proposing to
inject into the project too much 
uh sally i think uh liberal party ' s position is we welcome
this uh proposal
uh as you might know that we have been pushing the hong kong
government to inject more equity into both the airport and the airport
railway
i might just uh quote some figure in airport railway
the first proposal will inject three point seven billion
the job however is forty billion
so the ratio of that equity that to equity ratio is about ten to
one uh so i don't think uh such a high that equity ratio is you know uh
appropriate for such a large project
so we have been asking the hong kong government to put more equity
and i think the equity level now is much better
uh i think i think the borrowing would be uh roughly uh one to
two uh in other words put in two dollars equity to borrow one dollar uh of
loan
i think that ' s more one-word 
 you you you say 
yes you say your party welcome this proposal now
but if we go by your past record uhm if china object
to the proposals still
i think your party may change its view accordingly
 
 i think that ' s total totally unfair statement
uh t l
we have never change our proposal our our position in airport
we support our airport
we want the airport to be built we lobby the hong kong government
as well as the chinese government so 
 
 well are you prepared to support it at all costs to
the hong kong tax payers which is the concern which uh the united democratic
is putting uh uh waste 
i don't think uh uh it ' s fair to say that it ' s at all cost
uh when the memorandum was signed uh it was only uhm suggested in
the memorandum there will be twenty five billion saving the reserve
okay today the reserve is one hundred and thirty billion
now this is a an enormous amount of increase and it should be uh
distributed or located to various projects in hong kong and airport project
must be one of the most important project for hong kong
and i think to inject another forty billion into this project is
not going to affect the reserve that much is not going to affect the
livelihood of the people
so i don't think it ' s a it ' s a justifiable claim that the airport
injection uh in terms of equity is going to affect hong kong ' s uh uh 
econ economy and livelihood i think
 
mrchan from the dab
do you think the government proposal go far enough because initial
reaction from your member in the legislative council tam yiu chung indicated
that in fact it didn't
they still like to see the government put more money into the
airport project 
i would say if it ' s not far enough it won't be far away
i i think the good chance of negotiation and both
government are hope and uh uh really uh we ' re very optimistic that they
will strike a a right figure agreeable to both sides
and i fully agree with steven ' s comment that latest
proposed funding will not affect the livelihood of the hong kong people now
or in the near future
 
albert you ' re shaking your head 
 you don't you don't agree albert
uhm you know i ' m i ' m very surprise you know for a grass
organization like the dab will support such a uh massive equity uh an equity
injection
because you know if you look at the the government expenditure in
the past lots of political party including the udhk had demanding that the
hong kong government to put more uh support financial support into the
services to the elderly to the uhm uh uh in the health sector as well
as in the education sector
you know but the government in the past refuse to the put in more
uh capital investment as well as uh uh expenditure in this sector
because they claim the government claim you know that they don't
have sufficient financial resources
you know if the government have such a huge surplus as mrpoon
mention you know hundred and thirty billion
then i do think that they should uh put more money in the social
service sector if after they put all those investment in the social ser
 service sector and if after then they have additional or knew
 the surplus then i don't mind the government to put more money 
in the airport 
 
 but we had assurance from the financial sec 
uh secretary himself say that other services social services will not be
affected
already the government in the last two budgets and the governor in
his annual policy address has pledged a huge amount of money into this uh
backing up the social welfare services 
and i think that is only pure rhetoric from the government
side
if you look at the recent development for example sewage charges if
the government has sufficient financial resources why does the government
contemplating charging every single household for sewage charges
you know so that means that you know the government is putting
their financial expenditure into you know the the wrong priority
be mainly that they want to put more money you know in the airport
in the air airport railway but not on the social service area
i would argue that uhm most people in hong kong would like to
see the airport being constructed
because this would bring economic benefit to hong kong
it means uh on an average one point two five percent to our 
gdp growth 
so the spin of the the ripple effect of wealth creation will
benefit the whole community
uh if your party is going to vote against the proposal uh this
would make it very difficult
 right 
well the udhk is in strong support of the new airport and the
airport railway you know we are the first political party you know to
express our support
you know but we have to look 
 
 but from what ' s you ' re saying it doesn't seem to
 indicate that you ' re putting social welfare and other issues
above that 
 now okay 
you know but we have to look at the financial package presented by
the government on the airport and the airport financing 
in the past two and a half years the government have mention
again and again that the package put forward in nineteen ninety one was the
best financial package you know which had been uh uh studied by financial
consultant and by expert
and uh even the mtrc you know with the old financing package that
is only to the use about three point seven billion dollars as equity
injection strongly believe that they can build the new airport railway with
that amount of equity injection
you know so that you know if we believe that the the financial
package put forward by the government in the past are supported by the
liberal party you know in legco you you know in the past two years
why suddenly you know we have to scrap all the the old proposal and
 and the put in additional forty billions
 yeah 
mrpoon i ' m afraid the government the hong kong government
doesn't come out of this very well
i mean as as mrchan said there ' s been four proposals
why a change at this juncture now 
 i think it ' s totally unfair for albert to say
lb uh liberal party have supported previously
i mean i have never said that uh al liberal party
also always said equity is not enough right from the very very beginning
and i think well i ' m certainly pleased to see more equity
injected into the into the business
i think uh you know ud ' s position uh certainly have two problems
one is not been respecting the memorandum of understanding which
governs the airport and airport railway and other other airport core
programme which says there is a limit of the borrowing and that has been a
controversial item uh topic and that ' s number one
and unless we inject more equity into the job is not going to
resolve this problem
the second problem or of their argument is that uh the money has
to be in the reserve and therefore has to be spent in the in the in the you
know uh grass root and and those things
so we agree to that
but we must realize the difference between ld uh ud and uh
and lp i mean liberal party is that we believe the best thing to for hong
kong is to get the cake bigger not to argue to get the cakes smaller and
how to how to how to how to uh allocate the cake
we believe the airport and the airport core programmes uh
their implementation is going to generate more uhm economic activities in
hong kong will increase gdp for hong kong
uh we know the the recent increase in in reserve is really
generated by activities in the stock market
it generates tremendous amount of money for the hong kong
government
 so i will yeah i believe that uh you know if we might
taking out money from the reserve to into the airport project but at the end
we ' ll actually be generating more money into reserve by the additional
activities in the economic uh front
 property value 
 
well we ' ll just have to wind up the discussion for this
half of the programme but do join us again we ' ll be continuing with it in
just a few minutes a long pause and music 
welcome back to newsline and we ' re discussing with the three
main political parties their responses to the latest funding proposals for
the new airport
in the first half of the programme we heard from the democratic
alliance for betterment of hong kong mrchan that you supported to it and
the same from the liberal party steven poon
but albert chan from united democrats so strongly opposed it and
you expressed surprise that in fact the dab will supporting something which
would dump affect the grass expenditure of for the grass roots
uh you want to to respond to that didn't you mr
chan 
 yes 
i think mrchan ' s comment on dab is completely wrong and his
argument can't stand it uh good reasoning
we dab do care about the grass root people not less than
mr ka chan claim he ' s trying to 
on the argument about the social welfare 
well this it very difficult to put a demarcation line or what
level of social welfare benefit you should put into the second 
one-word 
you want to be a social state like some other european countries
and make hong kong bankrupt or 
so there must be some you must strike some balance on putting
money into infrastructure in uh as mrpoon said you put into some project
which you ' ll earn money
one dollar you put in you ' ll you will get back few dollars at
least
or you just spend the money taking for uh care for the old now
 and uh ma not left with no money in the future and 
 
 mrchan can i just ask you if these proposals put
to legco for their endorsement
would united democrats vote them down 
well we are still discussing with the government you know we
we just met with the secretary of treasury yesterday put forward
udhk ' s proposal on the additional uh capital investment for the year ninety
four ninety five
the amount of those proposal is about twenty billions dollars
and the udhk would like to see the hong kong government uhm 
on the the overall uh social concern
you know if they can look after the other issues such as education
health welfare and also other infrastructure other than the the airport core
project
the udhk may not object to additional equity injected
 
 but 
but when it comes to the crunch on the basis as it stands at the
moment would you be prepared to vote down these proposals
and thereby endanger an agreement between britain and china over
the airport which is mrpoon has pointed out is going to be beneficial for
the whole community 
well you know we are still waiting for the government ' s
response to our proposal
you know if the government uh meet our demand you know is
willing to put in more money in the other social service sector and
infrastructure
you know then the udhk may not oppose to the new equity
suggested by the hong kong government 
 but but of course it ' s 
 i i found this most amazing
i ' m sorry i ' m sorry about injection
you know on the one hand you object on the other hand you you
not have do not have the you know courage to vote it down
