during the last lecture we ' ve talked about the output and expense which are available for deduction under salary tax  all output and expense when they are not of domestic private or capital nature and they are in wholly exclusively and hurry incur for the production of accessible income with qualify for deduction from the accessible income of a tax payer and they will continue to look at this  the first uh the car the commissioner of inland revenue has issued a departmental uh departmental interpretation and practice note number nine which talk about uh all the allowance sections for uh for accessible income under salary tax and uh a number of specific items has been mention okay so let ' s go through this items within the special input of it a long pause  the first specific item being mentioned by the uh departmental interpretation note is the reinvestment of expense reinvestment  of expense  when the employee is required to work say away from uh his  normal base of work and he has uh some uh he has incur port on subsistent traveling and accommodation and if the employer reinverse an reasonable amount to him in order to cover such cost  usually the reinvestment of such expense they are not accessible they are not accessible  but this case only apply when the employee is uh required to working away from his usual working base for example if usually he ' s working in hong kong and then he is uh  one-word to work in china for a couple of weeks et cetera then almost uh uh cost which used as incur on subsistent traveling and accommodation while he ' s working away from hong kong then the reinvestment of such expense would be uh would be uh would not be accessible under salary tax if it is reinvestment of any other expense and those expense does not qualify for deduction that means it does not satisfy the tax as provide under section twelve subsection one a that means they are not at uh wholly exclusively and necessarily incur in the production of income then the reinvestment of such expense would be taxable would be taxable okay only reinvestment of such uh reasonable uh re uh reinvestment of expense would not be accessible and if the tax payer that is the employee claim for uh expenses which are insensitive inexpensive of the reinvestment usually the plain the de uh the claim of expense for deduction would not be qualify because it will fail the necessarily tax  so if the expense is not necessarily incur then of course it won't be qualify for deduction from the accessible income of a tax payer  this is the first specific item mention under the note  and the second one is professional subscription  if anyone is a member to a professional body then of course he he is required to pay a professional subscription annually generally speaking this professional subscription is not deductible is not deductible because uh it is not incurred in the production of income you pay subscription only because you are a member of a professional body okay you does not incur the subscription while you are performing your duties okay so strictly speaking the professional subscription does not qualify for deduction it fail the tax as provided under section twelve subsection one a but in factors in factors the inland revenue department as a concession will allow will allow deduction of subscription to one professional body to one professional body if the following tax are satisfy if the following tax are satisfy so even you are a member to more than one professional body then you are onl only entitled to deduction of subscription to one professional body only and the tax are the first tax is if the holding of the professional qualification is the prerequisite of the employment holding of the professional qualification is the prerequisite of the employment that means you must be a member uh to the to a professional body before you are employed this is one of the tax and uh second the second tax is when retention of membership and keeping a rest of the current development in that particular profession they are of regular use and benefit in performance of the duties  then uh only if both tax are satisfied then the subscription to that professional body will be allow for deduction  for example if you are a member of the hong kong s a and then if if you work in a audit firm as an auditor then usually this deduct uh this uh subscription will be deductible  but before uh of course before are allowed for deduction the inland revenue has to examine whether you satisfy both conditions or not okay so if you are a professional uh if you are in the profession of a say a doctor okay you are with profession body but you work as a citizen okay so that professional body in in fact is uh does not of regulate you and benefit in the performance of your duties the knowledge in that professional in that case the uh inland revenue can prejudge the deduction and because it does not satisfy both conditions as lay out  and in order to qualify for deduction you must a full member you must be a full member of the professional body as a student member you would not be qualified for the deduction  even it is prerequisites for the employ  and also under the de departmental interpretation and practice note number nine the commissioner has listed out a number of employees who are uh in a number of employments a flat rate allowance this flat rate allowance is provided because uh uh the inland revenue want to reduce the time in examine those numerous frames on uh small items on small items the first flat rate allowance provided is a flat rate of seven hundred dollars seven hundred dollars to cover the maintenance of equipment  to cover the maintenance of equipment to members of the following bodies this included the first one is the royal hong kong regiment any member of the royal regiment can claim a amount of  sub seven hundred dollars for maintenance of his equipment and second one is the auxiliary police force auxiliary police force and third one is the auxiliary fire services and auxiliary medical services civil aids services the royal hong kong auxiliary air force as well as any uniform members any uniform members of the immigration department the royal hong kong police force the fire services and trade industry and customs department  and in order to qualify for deduction that it is you must be a uniform member of the of these four government departments if you are only uh say a clerical staff there you don't have to wear uniform of course then you can't claim the deduction because the the flat rate allowance is to cover the maintenance cost of the special equipment to si uh the following members of the following body  but uh of course the tax payer they have right to claim more so if they think that seven hundred is not enough for the real maintenance cost they have incur in relating to his employment then he could claim more but uh he has to provide evidence okay he has to provide evidence to the inland revenue department in order to substantiate his claim  and this seven hundred dollars would be granted if any uh the members of the following bodies has claimed the maintenance cost uh they don't have to submit any evidence to the set of this and another flat rate allowance is a flat rate of five hundred dollars five hundred dollars in order to cover the cost of uniforms each woman charge et cetera to those sea one-word airline pilots and crews and the airline crews because of the special nature of their employment uh they may need to uh incur a cost on the uniforms and instruments or special charge they have to use and a uniform growth of five hundred dollars is allowed for sea one-word the airline pilot and air crews  and again if the claim for more they have to substantiate the claim by providing evidence  the departmental interpretation and practice note number nine also provide a number of specific items also mention a specific i a list of specific items uh for the treatment of the deduction uh throu i go through this very quickly because you can read them up in the appendix in your appendix nine in the two-words  okay so first of all it ' s a clothing usually uh any expense on special clothing in relation to employment for example for those actors or the singers if they have incurs uh expense on the clothing usually this is not allowed because they did not qualify for the tax  usually they uh you cannot qualify the tax wholly exclusively and necessarily incur in the production of income and however if it is a replacement of uh special clothes which is required by the employment then this may be uh deductible okay any on special circumstances and then commission pay any commission pay in earning your income and again usually this is not deductible but only if uh the the payment of commission is uh is really directly related uh to obtain of an income then it will be deductible otherwise it won't be deductible it must be directly pay in order to obtain sick a contract et cetera in early income and entertainment expense again usually this is not deductible unless unless it have it is unnecessarily incur unless it is necessarily incur and when claim an entertainment expense you have to provide for example the details of the name of the puzzle you are entertaining and also the nature of the business that you have been transacted uh from spending this entertainment expense et cetera okay so the tax is very straight and in order to qualify you have to provide all the details to the inland revenue department and the payment to assistants payment to assistants again usually this is not this is not necessary incurs so uh usually this is not deductible but again if uh if you can prove to the uh a inland revenue department that uh due to the last volume of the work you are involve and you are earn on the commission bases that means the more transactions then you will earn more uh then the payment for this uh assistant may be deductible okay if you can prove that uh this is uh expense having deduct to the large one of transactions and as result of this by hiring assistants you can earn more income and it may be deductible and subscription to professional societies so we have mention this already okay uh as a concession this will be deductible when the both conditions are satisfied and also any travel expense and the use of a motor car any travel expense from home to office of course it is private expenditure and won't be deductible however uh if it is due to nature of employment that employee needs to travels okay he he need to travel a lot and incur a travel expense and if the employer does not reverse the expense then uhm usually the travel expense may be deductible if it can satisfy the tax of course and if he provide his own car he ' s provide his own car to travel the travel trip is employment then uh we may apportion we may apportion uh his travel expense between uh the expense which is incur of business purposes and for private purposes lastly it ' s the use of the standard prem premises uh this is very rear okay when an employment requires an employee to work uh to work at home that means there is no office provided uh then if this is the necessary requirement then only the save the additional cost of the light take one-word et cetera incur will be deductible however if a specific area are distinct and separate area in his home has been use for the employment of the carry out of his work or the performance of the duties then may be apportion of the rent and rates pay may be deductible that depends on circumstances so these are the list of items which are specifically mention under the de departmental interpretation and practice note  other than the output and expense there is another deduction available under the inland revenue ordinance and this is provided under section twelve subsection one b and this is the depreciation allowance for capital expenditure depreciation allowance for capital expenditure  it must flat of any capital expenditure incur on plant and machinery common eight uh common example of plant machineries are motor vehicle motor vehicle okay and the use of supplant machinery is essential to the production of income is essential to the production of income that is it is essential to the performance of duties  then the depreciation allowance on such capital expenditure would be deductible would be deductible you can see there ' s some one-word of tax provided under section twelve subsection one a this is a more simple the tax is much simpler here okay you can see that we only have to satisfy one tax which is as long as the plant machinery is the use of such plant machinery is essential to the production of income or is essential to the performance of duties uh then the depreciation allowance will be qualified for deduction so there is no such tax as are wholly necessary and uh exclusively incur in the production of income as long as you can prove that it is essential the use of such is essential then it will qualify the deduction  and there are special rules there are special rules provided under the inland revenue ordinance in computing the depreciation allowance in computing depreciation allowance on plant machinery and this is mention under part six under part six of the inland revenue ordinance uh and later you would learn the details of this so i won't discuss this again  as i ' ve mentioned the tax provided under this section is is much simpler as compared with the tax provided under section four one a so apportionment of depreciation allowance if specifically allowed is specially allowed under section twelve subsection two that means if your plant machinery for example your motor vehicle they are used both for private and business purposes then when you compute the depreciation allowance uh we would apportion the depreciation allowance and only those portion which is applicable to business purposes will be uh deducted okay so if you use uhm your motor vehicle half a business purpose and half for private purpose then only half of the depreciation allowance will be qualified for deduction  this is provided under section twelve subsection two  and upon disposal of the plant abd machinery uh uhm we have to compute a balancing adjustment according to part six of the inland revenue ordinance the balancing adjustment uh is either a balancing allowance or balancing charge in respect of balancing charge it is treated as an additional income because balancing charge uh roughly speaking is the excess of depreciation allowance granted excess of depreciation allowance granted on that particular plant and machinery okay so because uh in uh in do of the inland revenue department has write the excess depreciation allowance on the particular plant of machinery upon disposal of that plant of machinery the balancing charge will be included as an additional income under section twelve subsection five  so you have to be careful although you don't know how to calculate exactly how to calculate uh the the depreciation allowance and also the balancing adjustment et cetera but uh whenever you see the word balancing charge make sure you add this back to your accessible income
