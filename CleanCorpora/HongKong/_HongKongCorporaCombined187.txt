good evening atv viewers and welcome to trackside wednesday evening at happy valley  the runners are already at the start for race three let ' s go and pick up the live action  so the next one in the paddock parade is uh going to be the five horse here lucky king  his first up this season  looks a big long three year old by rhythm  gary ng prepares big price one hundred and seventy to one  suppose it ' s uh simply a matter of watching him and hopefully he does something nice  yeah i think uh he showed on his barrier trial that he was probably going to need a little bit longer yet  and uh he doesn't look as though uh he ' s completely finished growing or should we say growing up at uh any rate  he ' s uh just showing all the signs of a bit of a baby uh here in the paddock at the moment  he ' s having a good look at the crowd he ' s taking it all in around him  he he looks to be in pretty good order  looks very healthy but uh also looks a bit soft i think he ' s going to need the run  well fair enough  two trials latest behind legend away drawn high in gate eight stepping up now to the 1650 metres  that first run was on a soft track when he was well and truly beaten  so seventeen hundred and seventy five dollars about him at the moment  now horse number one being wonderful life  can this the interesting runner of the race  he ' s come uh back heavier than he was last season when he went out a winner beating we know when and uh i note when he had his very first race start he was heavy like he is tonight and he was well beaten  yes and amazing to think he ' s heavy because he certainly doesn't look heavy in any way  uh i was actually thinking he looked as though uh he was a little bit on the light side  uh not really taken by him wonderful light  but he hasn't made his way uh past our position by the side of the paddock here at the moment he ' s uh just going to come past us now  and uh not overly taken darren quite frankly uh definitely prefer others yes and the ones not getting a rap first time out here  first up this season and uh sixty four dollars fifty for wonderful life  i thought you ' d have to include him but  i dunno  first up i ' m quite concerned about and the point darren made is quite solid  he ' s a well ender too i ' m i ' m still struggling to sort them out they always seem a bit big and raw and seem as though they take a little bit to really get rolling  indy ' s gem number two he fired up really keenly last time maybe he ' s going to travel a bit better  he ' s got a good barrier draw  the race plan says that he ' s going to have every chance to night and he ' s only sixty six fifty yes he should get into an ideal position drawn two just get a little bit of cover and uh well he ' s certainly one of the uh main serious chances in this  douglas white aboard uh for david oughton  he looks to be okay uh again uh he ' s just getting a fraction warm he ' s a horse that uh can seat up quite badly but uh he looks fit and he looks as if he ' s ready to do a job here again tonight darren and let ' s hope he gets a bit more luck uh in the early part of the race  he ' s got that nice draw again  beaten four lengths at the end after getting rather fired up and douglas white goes on him here tonight  that ' s a positive aspect  six point six in the betting  number three me and you got a nice run to win here two starts back the sha tin race was beyond him over the eighteen hundred but he now returns to the venue and the distance where he tends to do his best racing  yes he certainly seems to be at his best or reserves his best for the mile here at happy valley  he always takes the eye he ' s a nice type of horse  he ' s a big rangy galloper  he does have problems that he has to overcome but uh he ' s done pretty well and raced fairly consistently uh i don't i don't think he ' s ever a particularly good win bet but as regards a price proposition  again here tonight i think i ' d want to keep him safe  yeah i ' d agree with that he ' s not the sort of horse i ' d ever be saying go out and win bet on  won two of thirty one and for a long time looked as if he was going to be a nice horse  he wasn't a cheapy  definitely not a cheapy  the american came here at a big price tag  and uh unfortunately hasn't lived up to the expectations  the seven horse fortune tycoon wasn't beaten a hopeless margin first time out but he ' s got an awkward barrier draw here and he ' s one hundred and eighty three dollars fifty  not overly struck by him either fortune tycoon just getting a little bit warm uh  the trips okay but this is really a horse that seems to show his best fresh and first up and the fact that he threw in  what i would have said was just an average run first time out uh he ' s yet to really prove it second time out normally  i ' m not going to be with here tonight darren  yeah i was expecting a little more from him first up in a race that looked uh quite suitable he went out at five to one but if he won i wouldn't be totally surprised  could we read anything into it that they ' ve left for so long to back him up  in the past they ' re quite happy to back him up fairly quickly  is there anything from the paddock that says that mark  which fortune  yeah  no uh to be honest he ' s a he ' s such a long he ' s a bit of a long backed horse  he he doesn't he normally trains up a bit light  uhm i ' m actually very happy with him here tonight but ah  uhm  now we ' ve been looking at eight for a bit now how is he parading at forty four fifty  i thought that ' s just what we were just talking about no no seven fortune tycoon  i ' m just saying that they ' ve left it so long to back him up is there anything from the paddock to say why  you know his first race was race twenty i would have thought he would have backed up a lot sooner  yeah but he doesn't back up does he  that ' s what we were saying he doesn't  his second runs up are normally very bad so uh i wouldn't be if he ' s not fresh today i wouldn't have been interested in him anyway  uh fortune glory on the other hand i think  as i say he ' s a bit of a long backed horse  uh he does look fit  he looks well  it doesn't always impress me with the way he carries his head but uh i also feel that uh he ' s run fairly decently in his last two outings darren  yeah ran home really well particularly first up behind mascot and this is now the race that uh looks suitable  sixteen fifty here  he ' s run into the placings on a few occasions  nine applied supreme i thought ran the best race of his life last time  and i thought the key was it the key to it was the fact that that he didn't try and lead  he took the sit behind the speed and he had a had a kick there at the end  i suppose he could do the same here again he needs to work his way across from gate seven  uhm he doesn't look great in his coat at the moment but as you say he probably did put up the best performance of his life last time out  so uh i don't suppose i should be taking a too blunt an attitude over it  uhm i ' m not really taken by him but as i say that was a good effort last time  yeah i think you ' d have to find a place for him because of that last run  he ' s got an awkward barrier draw but uh that might set a few people off  uh martial hero  he ' s got some quick track work gallops down to his name in the uhm write ups  a few runs he ' s dashed home in twenty three and a half and twenty two seven  is going round at nine hundred and fifty dollars though he ' s weak  he ' s weak behind the saddle  he ' s got no depth behind the saddle at the moment uh i don't like the way he walks either he tends to just stumble along behind he doesn't get his hocks underneath him  uhm not for me not at the moment just  not fully matured and not strong enough  beaten a dozen first up on the soft going uh behind refreshingly blinkers applied to him for the first time  stephen baster riding for wong siu tang is nine hundred and forty three dollars  number eleven millennium legend has had the benefit of three runs this season he ' s got a bit of pace but he just doesn't seem to be going as well as he was last year  is that millennium legend  millennium  ha ha uh i don't like him he ' s got very very warm here tonight  again he can do this from time to time i just thought  early on this season he had really settled down and uh he was remarkably cool but uh  tonight he ' s getting back to normal and he ' s absolutely black with sweat uh not taken by him uh i didn't think he had the easiest of runs last time though okay that ' s the eleven horse uh he ' s one hundred and twenty dollars  as you can see twelve on screen at the moment telecom twin one o five and twelve dollars fifty  uh he sat forward in midfield first time out and uh he got a bump at the three hundred metres he was angling out and uh i i had sorted had questioned how  well he was going to finish off that time and then last time out i think he did his best running fifth here over the eighteen hundred metres  comes back in trip tonight  think he ' s got a slim chance but i don't know if you could run out and win bet him  i think this is a good jockey booking actually  shane dye i think will suit telecom twin ideally  i think he needs to be ridden cold he ' s quite an excitable type of horse  he ' s just uh getting into a bit of a sweat now  but again he ' s looking far stronger than he has done for quite some time he ' s keeping the condition on him  ahh i ' d be more than happy that he could uh run well here telecom twin  uh i do say i don't think he ' s a win bet but i do think he ' s one of those horses that could finish in the frame and uh i think he ' s a horse that shane dye will suit
