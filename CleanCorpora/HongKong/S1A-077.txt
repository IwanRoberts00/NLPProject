<I>
 
hello my name is colin
what ' s your name 
 and
 laugh 
oh my name is sherman
uh i ' m annissa
okay
let ' s let ' s continue our discussion
yes 
$b-laughs 
okay
uh you ' re you ' re talking
you you want to talk about uh the cartoon characters or
 
or sexual orientation 
you ' re you ' re interested in sexual orientation right
 
 no no 
just taking out the last conversation two-words
 
 laughs 
yeah yeah so 
 okay i want to ask you what ' s your opinion
about uh being gay or lesbian
uhm i think it ' s quite okay
uh ha 
 uh but uh
have you heard of uhm tut old story that uhm
actually uhm in the past everyone uh has another half
that means they have uh two head two heads uh four hands and uhm
 four legs 
 and then uhm they uhm how can i say
they have uh a pairs actually they are 
 they are pairs yes being separated 
so uhm nowadays uh the people need to find another half 
so if uh if the if they are original
if the the original pair is uh two men
then uh he need to find another half that is a man
 if uh two girl then another half is a girl
so uh i think it ' s uh quite natural 
$b-laughs 
 four legs 
 
 uh ha 
 they are pairs but something separated
 
 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
here you go quite natural
 i heard this story as well
but actually what it really means the story means is that
everybody is looking for themselves 
 yeah 
 yes i agree
 uhm 
where did you heard this story
uh actually uh because uhm this year i have taken a course
called uh sexuality
 
oh 
yeah 
$b-laughs 
 
talking otherwise talking otherwise 
 and
 laugh 
so uhm this story uhm told by uhm my lecturer
 
uh ha 
yeah
uhm uhm
uh do you know the origin of it
i can't remember
uhm uhm
uhm maybe from uh egypt or i don't know
 
why did you choose to take that course
did you ever chose it or not 
oh 
$b-laughs 
 
is it your choice 
yes
 
why 
uh because i think it ' s quite interesting uhm
because uhm it talks about uhm homosexuality 
 bisexuality uh transexuality 
 
 uh ha 
oh really okay 
uh crime
uh uh uh uh uh uhm about the sexual crime
 
uh ha 
 uhm 
 
 why you 
 everything about sex
 yeah everything about 
 
 why why would you interested 
because my boyfriend choose this 
$b-laughs 
 
uh your boyfriend wanted you to do it
so you did it because your boyfriend wanted you to do it
 right 
 right 
yes i just go there
 
why you think your boyfriend wanted you to do it 
 i think i think everybody are interested in sex
 you think 
yeah
 
well if if they are
then why you never hear much about it in hong kong
do you think people in hong kong are repressed 
 because most of the people think that uhm sex
is a taboo
uh they won't uh they do not want to talk uh 
openly
 uhm 
 yeah 
 
uh ha 
and uh so uh when you heard some uh sex jokes they would
laugh 
because uhm uh actually they want to express this
but uh but they think that it is a taboo so uh they just uh use
another way
 to use the sex jokes to express the feeling
 
 uh ha 
 i see 
or or so why do you think that is
why why is it so
because it ' s quite normal for people to talk about sex in
western countries 
yes i think it ' s the culture 
 yeah 
 people of culture
 different culture
 
wow
have you every talked to your parents about sex 
we won't talk to our parents about sex
 we won't 
 
why not 
yeah
i think uh it ' s a taboo between uh parents and children to
talk about sex in china 
 in in chi i mean i mean
in for chinese people
 
 have they evens 
 would they 
 uh 
then how did you learn about making babies and all of that 
we just learn it from biolo biology lessons
yeah 
$b-laughs 
 
from biology lessons 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah 
 
 how old were you 
uhm when i ' m when i was in high school i think
sixteen
sixteen maybe yeah
fifteen or sixteen yeah 
 yeah 
 
before you were fifteen did you know where babies come from 
just know uh it ' s uh come from mother
yeah
we just have some idea
maybe uh we get we get this idea 
 
 you know anything 
you didn't know anything about sex at all until you were 
fifteen or sixteen 
 we didn't we didn't know much
because uh in in chinese culture 
 
 know what ' s sex was before you were fifteen or
sixteen 
just very little
may maybe we can uh have some information in those magazines
 and we ' ll read the magazines and some people uh
send the questions to the editor
to arc ask the question about sex 
and we ' ll just read it and in some uh teenage magazines
uh so we get some idea about it
but for uh very uh precise details of uh how to have a baby or
 whatever we don't know
until we take the biology lessons
 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 right 
 
yeah 
yeah
 
wow 
$b-laughs 
then how about you when when
when did you uh get the idea about sex
 
uh when i was seven 
seven
 
yeah 
how did you know it
 
i ask my parents 
 uh 
 and your parents respond to you very naturally
 
they told me exactly what happen 
uh ha 
 uh ha 
 
 and then show me some books
and then say that if i was interested i can go up to
the library and take out some more books
so i did 
 uh 
i see
i see
but our parents won't do that 
they just they just say one-word it ' s not uh
suitable for children to know about it 
just forget it when you grow up you ' ll know
 yeah 
 yeah 
yeah
 
oh okay 
so i think uh culture has uhm play a very important
role yeah 
it ' s influencing people ' s idea on sex
maybe uh some people think uh sex is dirty and sex is just uhm 
an issue for adults
 important role yeah 
yeah
yeah
 
but you don't feel embarrass talking about it now 
it depends on who i ' m talking i ' m who i ' m
talking to
i won't talk i won't talk it about it to my with my parents
 yeah 
yeah
it is quite embarrass to told
yeah
 
 but uh if you embarrass talking about sex to a boy
 with your parents 
uhm all depends uh who ' s the boy
 
oh 
if the boy is is like you i i don't mind
may maybe uh 
 
 like me
what ' s like me like 
maybe a westerner one-word yeah
 a western
 
 uh okay 
 a westerner 
yeah i think a westerner are more open
 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
and uh we won't talk to it 
 
 won't you talk about it to your boyfriends 
 uhm 
 i don't have boyfriend 
 and
 laugh 
that ' s the point
 
because you are lesbian 
no 
 laughs 
 
uh what ' s three words 
two-words 
 i know i know
 
because you prefer girls right 
but uh uh sometimes uh my boyfriend say say said me uhm i ' m
why i don't know so many many things about sex
 
uh ha
do you think he knows a lot 
i think so 
$b-laughs 
 because i always teaches me uhm uh why uh uh
something uh
i i i don't know how to express it
uhm he always uh teach me new things 
$b-laughs 
 
 why 
uh okay 
i think guys are know better than boys
oh sorry than girls
yeah
 
 tut yeah but girls mature faster than boys
and actually woman are able to procreate are able to have
children before boys are
 they ' re actually sexually mature mature 
 sexually faster than boys
so maybe that ' s not true maybe that ' s that ' s the social
thing as well maybe 
 uhm yeah 
 yeah yeah 
uhm
it seems to me that guys are more interested in this topic
 than girls do
yeah
 yes 
 
why aren't girls interested in it
because girls are interested in it in other countries 
i think uh girls are more passive and more shy so uh
 
not necessary 
i don't know because uhm i study in a girl ' s school 
 
and uhm i think uhm most of our classmates uh do not talk
about this topic
 
 uh ha 
so why do you want a boyfriend then 
sorry
 
why why do you want a boyfriend 
$b-laughs 
i don't know
 
what ' s what ' s the purpose of that
what ' s the purpose of having a boyfriend 
i think there is no purpose
you just like the guy and then just get along 
 that is
 yeah choose him 
 
 uhm 
but what ' s the result
are you supposed to uh you get married or what 
yeah so one-word 
 
 so you automatically think about as soon as you
have a boyfriend
you automatically assume that you gone to get married to that
person
is that what you think 
 yes 
yes
 
so you never think about just going out with different people
to find out who you like the most or to experimental to do
anything like that 
no i just uh i think uhm
if i choose him then i uh uhm i will play a very very 
$b-laughs 
you will be very loyal to him 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 
 but there are so many different people in the
world
how do you know that you chosen a right person 
uhm 
but i think it ' s a kind of responsibility for us to loyal to
our lover
 
if you what if you find somebody else that you like
well it depends what you mean by lover as well
but you know what lover is 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 
not someone that you go to the movies with
but somebody who share one-word
 okay 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah
 
okay that ' s one
so we can differentiate between boyfriend lover husbands
 oh different categories obviously
but then how do you know that the first choice that you make
a little girl who who only learn about sex in high school when
she was fifteen or sixteen
and god gets her frog first boyfriend when she ' s
eighteen or nineteen
and she decides this is the only man in her life who she
should go to get marry and spend the rest of her life with
how do you know that it ' s the right choice when you have so
little experience 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
i think it ' s difficult to know
time proves 
 
 i ' m not say whether it ' s right or
wrong
i ' m just want to know why how how
 makes you so certain 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 argue 
 yeah 
uhm i think uh through uhm 
maybe uhm time can prove
because uhm sometimes uh
actually uhm uh i have uh i have three boyfriends in the past
 
 and uh 
 
 uh ha 
 i can so see how ' s your first boyfriend 
uh no the first one
uhm for the first one i think that uhm
uh our characters are very different
 we have a different point of view
 so i think that uhm he cannot be the one
uh he should not be the one that uhm i will be marry 
and uh for the second one because uhm uh he ' s not a loyal
person 
$b-laughs 
he goes together with another girl 
so uhm i uh uhm break our relationship 
 with him
and now it ' s the third one
uhm up till now i think it ' s quite okay
because uhm we have uhm same interest same 
hobbies and uhm
we have a same religion and uhm i think uh he treats me very
well 
so uh i hope he will be my husband but i i don't know either
 
 okay 
 uh ha 
 uh 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 i see 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
so that ' s what you think about when go out with somebody how
you don't actually think about i want to go out with a boy
because i like him
you think about i ' m looking for a a future husband 
yeah
 
really 
yeah
 
so when you look at a boy
you think i wonder he may a good husband
you don't think i wonder he may a good boyfriend or if he he
would be friends
but you actually thinking about whether he could be a good
husband 
uh
i think if you get along with a guy for a period of time
you will think about it whether uh he will be my husband or not
 but at very first moment you ' ll just treat him
as a boyfriend
 wow 
yeah
 
the rest of your life is quite a long period of time 
$b-laughs isn't it 
yeah
 
especially when you are only twenty two 
uhm
 
forty years fifty years sixty
long time 
for period of time i mean uh maybe two two or one or two
years
 
uh ha 
because uh time can prove a per how a person is
 
you ' re looking for change over time as well 
yeah
so uh after uh after first sight or after the uhm some
i don't know how to say
the just uhm the relationship are just uh go out or just uhm
go shopping
or just uh go to watch a movie 
and then you should uhm develop a relationship
that means uhm this is not only love but also responsibility
 
that means you are loyal to this one to the person that
uhm yeah get along to
and uhm 
$b-laughs do you know what i mean
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
i know what you mean 
yeah
so i think i ' m after the first sight
and uh after you have uh uh go with this person
you need to develop a a relationship
to uh develop a responsibility to that guy
 
uh ha 
yeah 
so that uh if he uhm
he maybe change but uh you have to uhm
maybe you have to change either
 
oh what ' s happen if you meet somebody else who you like more 
then what 
$b-laughs 
uh
i think i ' ll i may shift to that guy
 
uh ha ha ha 
$a-and-$b-laugh two-words 
uhm for me uhm if i have i ' ve married uh i will just uhm
be loyal to the relationship 
 yeah be loyal to the relationship
but uh if i haven't married uh maybe i will shift to another
guy
 
okay 
yeah
yeah
 
so what if this keep happening for the rest of your life 
$b-laughs 
i think marriage is an end to our choice 
 laughs 
 
okay
so how old are you when you get marry
how you decide when you get marry 
before thirty
 
before thirty 
yeah
 
why 
you mean after thirty i think
 
after 
yeah
just around thirty something 
because uh uh 
because after marr uh because after marriage uhm
maybe i want to have a baby
 so uh if uh 
$b-laughs 
 
 why 
 uh ha 
if you are too old then it will be very dangerous
 yeah 
yes
 
yeah but actually you can do that right after the age of forty or
or or older nowadays 
 i know that
but uhm if you have a a baby then you will have a
if you are too too old to have a baby then you will have a gen
 generation gap
 
a generation gap 
 yeah 
$b-laughs between the children
 
i don't believe that
i think maybe that ' s a good point
i think that children get along with their grandparents better
than they get along with their parents sometimes
 because there isn't generation gap 
$b-laughs 
what are my own experience 
 uhm 
 uh yeah 
i don't know but uhm maybe uhm
if the parents too old then they will not have energy to
uh take care of their children
 
sure but they have more experience
so they know how better to look after them 
yes
yeah i agree
 yeah i agree 
 
 what are may be more establish their career and
have more money to look after them 
yes 
$b-laughs 
 
so if you feel rush
what about yourself
i mean what what about what the things are you want to do in your
own life 
uhm
 
don't you have any things that you want to do
don't you want to travel or other things that you like to
experience to yourself
after all you got your own mind as well 
yeah
uhm
at this moment i want to get a good job
yeah
yeah
but it ' s difficult to find jobs in hong kong
if i if you ' re not par uh particularly good in
academic and the
if you don't know any anyb anyone who is working in uhm
some companies
 and it ' s uh if you don't have any relations
 with others 
it ' s difficult to find a job in hong kong
yeah
 yes 
 
 uhm uhm 
when do you graduating 
this summer 
 uh this summer
 yes 
 like gloria
 
uh ha 
 yeah
 
what sort of job you want to do 
uhm i don't know
some maybe some jobs are work
maybe working about people instead of working with paper works
yeah
yeah
because uhm 
 
 have you decided yet of what you ' re going to do
i ' m not decided
uh because uh for our field of study uh the choices are very
limited
uh in those we are we are 
uh i ' m studying english and french and uh the
field uh
 
 what ' s study 
 uh ha 
it shouldn't be limited
i mean it ' s quite easy to get a job if you speak english chinese
 and french 
 no because uh if those jobs that we can do
that means everybody can do that 
because uh if those jobs we apply is open to any discipline
and many people will complete with us and it ' s very competitive
 yeah 
 yeah 
 
 yeah but actually in hong kong there aren't many
people who speaks good english 
i don't speak any i don't speak good english either even
though i ' m taking a major in english 
 and
 laugh 
you know whether you are majoring in that subject or not
it it doesn't mean it doesn't mean you ' ll speak you ' ll
do uh particularly good in that aspect
 it doesn't matter yeah 
 
i know 
yeah
 
i just graduated in chinese 
 and
 laugh i 
but it ' s different but it ' s different
because uh we ' re we ' ve we ' ve been educated in
english for so many years
and it ' s it is supposed that uh we must have speak good english
 it 
especially we are uh an university graduate 
but uh in rea in re in reality it ' s not case
 yeah 
 yeah 
 
 uh ha 
why do you think that is 
pardon
 
why why 
uh because we do not have practice
 yeah 
 yeah 
 
 uh 
and we do not have enough enough practices
we just uh speak english in those tutorial classes
 and uh we are spend most time on listening
rather than speaking
i think uh speaking is very important to learn a
new language
 and 
 yeah 
 
 yeah 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
and uh we just uh maybe in our daily life conversation
we use cantonese rather than english
so uhm uh we do not have any chances
just uh maybe uh listen to the lecturer or gives
uh some comments that ' s all
so uhm for those uh who are studying uhm in other maybe
majoring in other subjects
then they find that uh for them oral english really a big
problem for them uhm to have a interview when they are
 for uh when they are interview for the job application
 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
 
 uh ha 
yeah yeah
 job interview yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 so i ' m quite worry about that
yes
i will be unemployed after after a few months
 
uh i don't think you should worry about that
i ' m sure there ' ll be jobs 
 uhm 
 there are many jobs uh available
but uh the salary is not attractive
you know it ' s just the maybe about uh six
thousand or five thousand dollars
it ' s not enough for for maintain a living i think 
 yeah 
 
 yeah 
 yes 
 
 yeah sure
it ' s not much money at all 
yeah
yeah
yeah
i want to uhm
usually i want to be a teacher and i uh apply uhm 
i have send uh almost eighty eighty letters to uh 
 
 eighty 
 eighty letters yeah
 
yeah 
to uh
because i ' m a catholic so i send letters to the catholic school
 
uh but uh but up till now i just have uhm few responds 
$b-laughs 
i uh went to a few interviews
 uhm most of them said oh you are fresh graduated
