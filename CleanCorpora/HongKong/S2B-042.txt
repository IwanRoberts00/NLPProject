<I>
good afternoon everybody 
welcome to my presentation 
today i ' m going to present as the title suggests dimensions of the
chinese person perception 
first of all i will talk about the reasons for carrying out this
research 
secondly i will tell you about how the research was conducted
then it is followed by some results discussion as well as some
future research directions 
first of all why this research is carried out 
first of all i want to tell how many dimensions of person perception
do hong kong chinese use 
that means how do hong kong chinese use the the factors the
personality perception factor to describe somebody 
second do indigenous measures produce the same results as the
imported measures 
that is uh what ' s the relationship between the instrument that
is imported from the west and the instrument that is developed locally or
by some chinese psychologists 
then this is followed by does a culturally balanced scale produce
different or better results than those previous measure 
that is the indigenous and the imported 
now it comes to how the research was conducted 
first of all i will factor analyze two sets of representative
descriptives and as i told you before one is indigenous in nature that is
we call out this items from some chinese psychologists whi uh who
developed the items locally
and the other is imported i mean other instrument is imported in
nature
that is we translate the instrument from the west
and then after the factor analyses we obtain or we select salient
descriptives that is uh representative of each of the factors
and uhm uh i ' ll use secondly i ' ll use both indigenous and
imported items with the same subjects
that is i skim i mean i gleaned the salient description from the
indigenous and the imported instruments and then mix them up in the
questionnaire and then ask the same subject to fill them in
and in in that way the relationship between these two sets of items
can be studied by means of multiple regression economical correlation 
and thirdly i ' ll regress each set of scale that is indigenous and
imported against some real life criterion variables which were requested from
the same subjects 
and then finally i ' ll repeat the procedure c that is to
regress the scale against some criterion variables
but this time i ' m using some a culturally balance scale which i ' ll
explain afterwards
and then in this way the relative effectiveness of the three sets
of scale that is indigenous imported and the culturally balanced scale in
explaining the criterion variable 
and uh now i ' ll talk about that is what have i used in the study
they are the natural language traits lexicons that is as the source
of the descriptives in use
i use it because people very often use them natural language to
describe somebody as a personality description questionnaire
i think we have the responsibility to include these because it ' s
 be rather useful by the people to use it in the daily life 
and then what ' s the result
that is number four american using english dutch using dutch
germans using german 
that is for the big five dimension which is well-establish in the
west
people from from uh holland people from germany they also i mean
they under their research they also discover these five dimensions 
but for long for the last factor that is some people will describe
it as culture somebody will describe it as intellect they and some more more
some people will describe it as openness to experience because of the
nature of their factors
but then in my studies that of i mean giving an accurate or correct
answers for we why should or we what should call for the last factor
i ' ll include the big five dimensions plus the openness to experience
dimension to let the subject rate it and then factor analyze to see how the
factor uhm i mean the fifth factor or the sixth factor should be named
so totally i will include six scales in my first study
that is extroversion agreeableness conscientiousness neuroticism
culture and openness to experience 
and then for here i ' d like to thank luke goldberg for
providing me the big five trait measures
and also i ' ll thank jeff mccrae for providing me the
openness to experience trait measure so that my study can be carried out
and as the factor analysis result pointed out i discover six factor
which is really has a clear correspondence to the big five plus the openness
to experience in the west
okay secondly i ' ll report on the chinese i mean the indigenous to
how is the factor how are the factor i mean what factors are discovered in
this study 
in nineteen seventy-three yen and lee called it an amount
of uh more than five hundred personality descriptives
and then in nineteen eighty-five yen and bond choose some uh one
hundred and fifty and then let the subject do and then factor analyze it
and then fro from the factor analysis table i get out
some of the salient or important ones 
and then for william liu in nineteen eighty-five also he he
included some items in his scale for saying that oh for the he ' ll add some
item which is in compensation for yen and bond nineteen eighty-one for
example like concern about face nationalism something like that
and then from yen and bond nineteen eighty-five and from liu
nineteen eighty-five i try to call out some i mean glean out some salient
description
that is who has the a high factor loading in each factor
respectively
and then mix them up and then include it in a questionnaire and let
the subject do 
so what ' s the result 
i discover two four six six chinese dimensions of chinese
perception 
the first one is dominance social certainty expressiveness
 educated morality neuroticism and finally heterosexual interest
and the and this is the i mean the six dimension by our that i uh
discovered from an indigenous instrument 
so af after that i am going to tell about how do i create
the complements that is the culturally balanced scale
how do i do it
first of all i ' ll select four to eight exemplars with high factor
loading that is around point four o or above form the twelve factor which
come form the indigenous and imported instrument
that is six from each of the instrument
and then i ' ll let the subject do i mean filled in the ratings plus
some personal information for example their academic performance and uh
uh degree of westernization leadership friendship latent 
etcetera etcetera 
then the next step is to factor analyze the resulting pool of items
the result is as follow
i extracted eight factor with acceptably high combat alpha
the eight factors are emotional stability extroversion 
application openness to experience assertiveness restraint 
helpfulness and intellect
so the next is concerning are the factors from the indigenous and
imported instrument
are they the same or what ' s the relationship between the six
factors from each of the instrument 
as you can see from the figure the relationship among the imported
factor and the indigenous factors are mixed
 with as you can have a look on the r square the highest is
sixty-six
that is the indigenous factor of expressiveness is explained by the
imported extroversion emotional stability and openness
and the lowest r square is ten percent which is represented
indigenous heterosexual interest is explained by extroversion only 
and this is so-called the the relationship among the imported and
the indigenous factors
finally we ' ll talking about how well do the predicted variable
that is the three sets of scale that is indigenous imported and as
culturally balance scale in explain the target the criterion variable
that is the one that i describe to you before 
as you can have a look this one represented the imported imp
imported scale and then indigenous
this is followed by sa
sa is the culturally balanced scale
that is the eight dimension
as you can see none of the scale none of the set none set no set of
scale is i mean very powerful in explaining the criterion variables 
except it for the indigenous scale
they account for twenty-two percent i mean they explain twenty
 perce twenty-two percent of the variance for the degree of
westernization with the rest for from the fewest to zero one per
cent 
that is one percent
and uhm for this as you can have a look on table three
it is self-explanatory 
so what ' s the conclusion 
for long in nineteen ninety in nineteen ninety yen and bond explain
they try to explore the relationship between the indigenous and the imported
scales 
and uh it is supposed that the indigenous scale can take the
individual differences more fully because it ' s develop locally i mean it ' s
indigenous in nature
and for at at present study we do replicate this problem and i mean
replicate the study and then see what ' s the relationship between the
indigenous and ex the imported scale
as you can see it ' s like a mixed picture with the lowest ten
percent of r square and with the highest sixty-six percent
and then finally when you have a look on the table we hope that
maybe even for the indigenous they do not account for more variance in the
criterion variable
maybe the culturally balanced one is better because the cons
 the scale consists of items i mean the salient item form imported and
indigenous
and it is hoped that it can take the full range of individual
differences in the chinese culture 
but nonetheless i mean if replicated with other criterion
variable and other samples the present results would challenge the 
investment required to develop local instrumentation on scientific 
brands 
and this the end of my presentation
and it ' s the time for me to entertain some of your questions 
thank you 
good morning mr chan lady and gentlemen 
it is my pleasure to take this opportunity today to say a
few word at the opening of this conference 
as hong kong ' s largest employer and exporter earner the
clothing industry makes an indispensable contribution to the economy
 and there ' s no doubt that our clothing manufacture have done well
 to have maintained their position
however a growing awareness that our original labours are
acting their way into stronger competitive position have brought changes 
and inevitably there will be more 
some companies are opting to have to move part of their
operation to low-cost area in the region 
other are adjusting their production method to rise their
productivity level whichever route or combination of option a company choose
a common concern is surfacing among this intent on staying ahead of
the competition
they decide to improve their value-added performance 
investigating the application of information technology the
subject of this conference is a positive step towards a higher
value-added mode of the production 
and ninety some technology is not industry specific 
however with the new software application being developed all the
time 
it ' s particularly useful to focus upon example problems and
solutions provided by those who are expert in the field 
we are very fortune to have with us today and tomorrow 
number of experts in this field besides company directors and academics
familiar with the local scenes 
severals oversea guests has been invited to bring us their
perspective on a variety of issues related to the subject 
i would like to express my appreciation to both hong kong
productivity council and the clothing institute clothing and footwear
institute for their joint effort in organizing this event 
i hope all our participants will be able to share the experience
and technical expertise of our prominent speaker in today and tomorrow
presentation 
without further ado i declare the clothing industry convention
ninety-two open 
thank you 
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen uhm
as the clothing industry conference draws to a close i wish to
thank the speakers and all who attended for making this year ' s forum
such a worthwhile experience 
on behalf of the organizers i would also like to express our
gratitude to the five sponsoring organizations for their past and
continuing support namely the federation of hong kong garment
manufacturers hong kong garment manufacturer association hong kong
knitwear exporter and manufacturing association limited hong kong woollen
and synthetic knitters knitting manufacturers association limited and the
textile council of hong kong limited 
this conference as implied by its theme a new horizon in the
clothing industry was intended to give participants a new insight to
enhance their understanding of the users of information technology 
the application of information technology in the clothing industry
 are diverse and varied and it is impossible to cover all the options
in two days 
however it is our aim that the conference programme would
be able to provide some solutions or inspirations to participants in
the area of technology management quality and productivity
enhancement 
as organizers both hong kong productivity council and the clothing
and footwear institute will be delighted to hear your comments and
feedback is always appreciated and helpful in planning future events 
also as the government ' s uh principle technology transfer agent
 the hong kong productivity council will be happy to assist the clothing
industry should manufacturers require related information or consultancy
advisors 
their consultancy staff come from a wide range of science and
business backgrounds and they take an integral integrated approach to
cater to the needs of their clients 
many small and medium size enterprises in hong kong have
benefitted from their indu industrial support services 
as hong kong ' s garment industry move further into the phase of
value added manufacturing it will need to become more innovative and
skillful in the area of design sourcing marketing and so forth
as discussed earlier in the conference presentations information
technology can be applied to these activities for improved productivity
and quality 
it is now it is now up to individual participants to pursue the
options and implement changes 
thank you
