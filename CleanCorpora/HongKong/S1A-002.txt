""
 uhm  
""
and how
""
did you try to get into one of the hotels for foreigners 
""
""
yes but uh it  ' s extremely expensive and they don't have the
""
they don't have place except for the  very expensive hotel like
uhm hyatt    uhm 
""
hyatt sheraton
 
""
 uhm  
""
how expensive are they   long pause 
""
""
well  a hundred a hundred us dollar per night
""
""
oh
 
""
right right 
""
""
it  ' s very expensive
 
""
but  as you say you should book your hotels ahead 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
uhm  but  you  ' re not able to book one of the hotels for the
locals
""
how can she  organise her accommodation in a cheap hotel 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
uhm i know there  ' s a very a rather cheap hotel in uhm 
call  yue shu fan dian 
""
""
are there any youth hostels
""
""
no
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
uh the hotel is uh relatively cheap
""
uhm it cost for  just about  uhm 
""
i i can't recall exactly the amount
""
about  three hundred dollar
 
""
hong kong 
""
""
hong kong dollar per night
""
double room
""
and  if  uh if you  ' re sharing a room with uhm you can just
book a double room and  you can  uh three persons can live there
""
they won't  charge you extra money    
""
and the manager of the hotel are hong kong people
""
  you can speak  in cantonese
""
they are very nice
""
uhm  they will teach you uh how to  how to get to the scenic
spots
""
uh they will make some  arrangement for your transportation if
you want them if you ask them
""
they are really nice
""
""
 uhm  
""
 oh really   
$b laughed 
""
uh uh
 
""
do you speak mandarin 
""
""
no
 
""
how is she going to get by  in beijing   without any
mandarin  
""
""
 is it a big   problem if i don't speak mandarin
""
uh because i just finished uhm beginner  ' s course 
$z laughed  and i i don't think i can  tackle the real problem 
$z laughed 
""
""
uh i think that  ' s a real problem for you
""
i speak mandarin
""
i  ' ve finished the advance course  but  i think the local 
bei  beijing people speak  the the  the mandarin they speak is a
little bit different because uhm  the putonghua we we speak  uhm 
include just part of the beijing dialect
""
but in beijing most people especially the  uhm people who are
less educated they speak beijing dialect which is really difficult for us to
understand
""
even i myself i finished advance course i  can't hear what they
say 
""
so if you don't  know mandarin that will be a big problem
""
you have to write all the time
""
""
oh  laughed 
 
""
uhm 
""
""
so i have to prepare a lot of  paper  laughed 
""
""
yes 
""
i   think  so
""
""
 oh  
""
how long is your trip
""
""
uhm  twenty days
""
""
twenty days
""
""
i  i went to beijing then i  then i travelled by train
to  uh  shandong    
""
uhm up
""
do you know the shandong peninsula
""
""
 uhm  
""
  no 
 
""
 no    laughed  
""
""
uh  well
""
i went to  ji nan     qianghai  one word
spoken in mandarin      qingdao  four words spoken in
mandarin   laughed 
""
then i
""
""
 uh uh    uh uh  
 
""
sorry    what was that  
""
""
  laughed  
""
""
 then i   went back to beijing
""
but it  ' s very difficult to uhm  get a ticket
""
uhm  get a train ticket     uh from  north
down south    
""
and it  ' s  uhm  a problem if you want to travel from beijing
to the south
""
""
 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
is it  difficult  to uh buy a  ticket
""
""
there  ' s there  ' s a special office for  foreign visitors
in uh beijing uhm train station    
""
you can get a  you can bet you can get better seats and at a
lower at a higher price 
$b and
$z laughed  at the at the  foreign visitors  tic  uh ticket
office
""
uhm  last uh when i  went there last year they use the uhm
 exchange coupon     but  that  ' s that  ' s no longer use
now
""
  i don't know  whether the  pri  but i assume
the price will be  much higher than
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
because uh some of my friends told me that uhm it  ' s a 
big confusion to have uhm  seats in the train  is it
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uhm  you get no problem if you book your seat in hong kong
    then  you travel from hong kong to uhm  guangzhou
""
uh then from guangzhou to beijing
""
no problem   because  the train is run by  and
supervised by  uhm  south south people
""
  but if  you want to get a train from beijing down
to   guangzhou   that  ' s a big problem    
""
uhm  no order at all 
$b laughed 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
what was the quality of the train like 
""
""
uhm
""
""
  is it dirty 
""
""
 that depends  
""
that depends what kind of  uhm  ticket you got
""
  if you  got the  four words spoken in mandarin
 that  ' s the the soft
""
you have   soft bed  uh   hard bed and 
soft seat hard seat
""
if you got the bed  category  it  ' s  okay people are uhm
""
""
the people even they  ' re  local people they are  more
educated     richer   uhm     more
polite  
$z laughed 
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 soft bed  
""
 hard bed  two-words   
""
 uh uh  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 more polite  
""
""
the  tr  the train compartment is cleaner
""
no problem
""
but  if you got the  a hard seat or soft seat   
     the problem  is that uh terrible   uhm
""
""
maybe there  ' re people who have  who don't have a seat
""
they just got the ticket    
""
uhm the the ticket is for them to stand in the train compartment
""
they will ask you  to let them sit    for  a
few  wh  uh for a while    
""
don't let them
""
""
 uh  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
 
""
oh   you don't get  your seat back 
""
""
 they will take  
""
yeah   uhm  
""
some of them may just  uh lie down on the on the  
floor  so   you  
""
it  ' s very difficult for  for you to move especially when you
when you have to go to the washroom
""
  it  ' s    it  ' s very difficult 
""
""
 oh 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  the  
""
the reason i asked about that was because last year my son 
   did the silk road trip 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yep
 
""
he went from xian     to islamabad   
 in pakistan    
""
and he travelled some by  by plane   and  by
train and even on camels
""
uhm but he wasn't terribly impressed with the trains 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh huh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 oh yeah 
""
the food is  uhm  is a problem
""
you have to bring some food    yourself 
 
""
 that  
""
did you get sick  at all 
""
""
about the food
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i i  ' ve travelled by train in china  uh before so i 
get some   precaution  i think
""
i know  uhm my  trip is for about train trip is for about
three days   so  i brought food with  with me   and
  didn't eat anything in the train
 
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
 and  one-word   
""
cos my son was away for four weeks     and he lost
fourteen pounds  in weight 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
how old is your son
 
""
sixteen 
""
""
oh
""
""
the food is  
$b laughed  uh i think
""
""
no one   can accept 
 
""
 well    my son my son came back and said that he
had decided that uhm  in in the past he had always said he liked chinese
food     he said now mum i don't like chinese food 
$b laughed 
""
i like cantonese food
""
  there  is a difference 
$a and
$b laughed  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
yes 
""
and  some people may have sleep problem during the train 
trip     uhm  because it  ' s always moving and  some some
people find it difficult to sleep
""
""
 uh  
 
""
it  ' s not like the kcr 
""
""
of course not  all laughed 
""
and  uhm during the night some people  uhm  will  will
 some people will not sleep during the trip and they will  t  they
will be talking during the night     and  maybe that that
will disturb disturb you
 
""
 uh   
""
""
uh uh
 
""
what kind of people travel 
""
""
uhm  you mean from south to north or
 
""
oh just in your trip that you took from  from beijing
""
i was just wondering what  i mean presumably that ordinary 
chinese farm worker     would he have uh or she have an
opportunity to travel 
""
""
 uh uh  
""
""
yes
""
uhm i  ' ve i  ' ve met  business men  uhm  university
students uhm some  chinese officials uh
 
""
but not ordinary  farm workers 
""
""
yes they   s 
""
uh farm workers  do travel but they  ' re in uhm  uh hard seat
  compartment 
 
""
 oh   right 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
uhm  uhm 
""
""
so did you travel in soft  compartment or hard  depart
 compartment
""
""
uh hard bed
""
""
hard beds 
""
uhm uhm
""
""
are there many  heavy smokers around you
""
""
yes
 
""
uhm 
""
i would hate that 
""
""
yes
""
""
uhm
""
""
but you can't ask them to stop because all the people smoke
there
 
""
are there non-smoking compartments 
""
""
no
 
""
and you said you wanted to go to japan also 
""
""
yes
 
""
why do you want to go to japan 
""
""
uhm
 
""
do you speak japanese 
""
""
no
 
""
you don't speak mandarin and you don't speak    laughed
  
""
""
 but i   appreciate uhm that they are polite 
 and  the city is very clean  and
 
""
 uhm  
""
have you been before 
""
""
no but my sister went to japan for three times
 
""
oh really 
""
""
yes and she appreciate  japan very much and she always
encourage me to  visit japan
 
""
yes 
""
""
so i want to visit japan very much
 
""
do  chinese people have any trouble  in japan with being
accepted 
""
""
oh
 
""
is there any racial prejudice 
""
""
no uhm  they  ' re treated as  foreigners   and
 there  ' s no racial prejudice
 
""
 yes   
""
i once took a train from tokyo  down to hiroshima 
""
and  it was a very beautiful train    
""
but we went into the dining car to have lunch and uhm my children
were quite small at the time and very blonde 
""
and uhm  the way the dining car is organized is that there is a
a hallway a   corridor  going along the side and then there  ' s a
glass wall   and  then the dining compartment   
""
""
uhm and then the corridor is very narrow  uh so people wanting
to go from one carriage to another pass the dining car have to go along that
narrow
""
but they can look through the glass window     and
see the people having their lunch
""
and these japanese men were stopping to take photographs of me and
my children because we are blonde
  laughed 
""
i was sitting there eating my lunch and they  ' re taking
photographs of me
""
i got such a shock
""
oh 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
but i know uhm  they like foreigners very much especially
the us people
 
""
that i found that the japanese people were very polite even just
coming from narita airport we went by train and to tokyo city   
""
""
and we had suitcases and the children were very little
""
and  this man could see that  that was a bit of a problem
and he was so nice
""
he came out of his way
""
he didn't get off the train when he should have
""
and he came with us  to help us with our bags everything
""
and then he was so nice so polite    
""
i can't imagine that happening in hong kong  laughed  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
so do you do you like japan
 
""
i did
""
i did
""
i mean it was long time ago
""
it  ' s in nineteen eighty  four 
""
uhm so it  ' s ten years ago    
""
uhm  but i did like it    
""
i particularly liked the trains 
""
they are so efficient     because when we came
back from hiroshima we were supposed to get on a train that left hiroshima at
one minute past four    
""
and so we went to the platform and at about  one minute to
four  the train came in  and we got on the train 
""
and it left almost straight away at four o'clock and we had heard
these wonderful stories about how  absolutely accurate japanese trains
are  never late but i thought this was a bit poor cos it left one minute
early 
$a and
$b laughed 
""
that if it hadn't been one minute early it was the wrong train
""
right behind the train we got on was another train   
that was  going to leave at one minute past    and  we
were on the wrong train     so we had to at the next station
we had to get off the train stand on the platform wait for one minute  all
laughed  to get on the next train 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yes  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh
""
 two-words   
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm  
""
how  ' s it compared with the trains in france or germany
 
""
oh  much better
""
i don't
""
i i don't think there are any better trains  than the ones in
in japan
""
i mean i  ' ve been on trains through europe
""
i  ' ve been on trains uhm  in australia
""
i  ' ve i  ' ve trained right across australia 
""
very comfortable but not like the japanese trains 
""
do you think you  ' ll go to japan 
""
""
no
 
""
never 
""
""
never
 
""
no desire 
""
""
no
 
""
why not 
""
""
uhm  uhm that  ' s my prejudice    
""
i hate japanese
""
""
 uh  
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i can never forgive them for what they do during the 
world war two to chinese people 
""
uhm
 
""
my uncle is like that 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
yeah
""
""
and  i think they are hypocrites
 
""
even today 
""
""
uhm some of them 
""
but uhm  well  i don't want to talk about japanese
""
i get rather emotional when i talk about them
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and  i think 
""
uhm i don't think they  ' re as perfect as you  ' re talking about
   
""
uh one of my friend go to japan last year  and when she get
there  uhm she feel she felt very uncomfortable she  she  fe 
""
uhm  she said every people  was uh were staring at her 
 because  she is a foreigner
 she is a  chinese
""
""
 uh  
 
""
 like  
""
maybe the japanese are more prejudiced against chinese than they
are against europeans 
""
""
yes
 
""
because i didn't really feel any  prejudice   
 when i was there 
""
uhm but then the japanese men do  love blonde hair
""
maybe you should dye your hair before you go    all
laughed  
""
uhm but i know my uncle
""
uhm i mean he fought in the war    
""
uhm he wasn't actually in japan he was in  italy   
 uhm and in the african desert
""
uhm but the attitude of  new zealanders who  were alive
during the war like my mother and her brothers and sisters is that although
japan  didn't take new zealand   during  the war  
  they  ' re buying it now 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 oh  
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
huh
""
""
uh not only new zealand
 
""
oh not at all only new zealand but that  ' s all it bothers my
family  laughed 
""
they don't care  of course about   other countries 
laughed 
""
uhm 
""
""
do they hate hong kong people because many people 
emigrate to australia this year
 
""
well  uhm i  ' m not sure about australia
""
uhm in new zealand  there there are a few problems
""
uhm  but the problem aren't really racial 
""
uhm there are problems like uhm hong kong families have taken
their children down  so that they can go to school and get new zealand
passports
""
but the family doesn't stay down there
 the children stay on
their own
""
they live in a house by themselves  and uh of course they get
into a lot of trouble 
""
no mother or father to look after them
""
nobody 
""
so you  ' ve get these teenage children who can just  run riot
   
""
and and a lot of these children have been going to the school
where my  brother  ' s children go and and there  ' s been a lot of trouble in
the school
""
uhm and the other problem is  new zealanders are fairly
relaxed     and hong kong people are fairly hard working 
all laughed  and the combination doesn't always work well because the
hong kong children come in  they work very hard at school   
 they get as and the new zealand children  are a little bit
""
well they begrudge  it
""
they say you know why should you come in here and and get a
grades
""
uhm why don't you learn to do nothing like  laughed 
""
and i think it  ' s probably worse in australia cos i think
australians are even more lazy than new zealanders 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
uhm
 
""
uhm 
""
""
how about the estate market
 
""
the which 
""
""
uh the property market
 
""
in new zealand 
""
""
yeah because i i  ' ve heard  uhm  when hong kong go when
hong kong people go to a place  they will make the property market the
price of the property market to go up
 
""
well  that  ' s true
""
  uhm   i think that would happen anywhere 
""
uhm it  ' s not  particularly a big problem in new zealand 
  
""
uhm  because we  ' ve got a lot of land 
""
see our our country is  the size of great britain  
 
""
we have three million people half the population of hong kong
   
""
seventy million sheep 
$a and
$b laughed  but they don't take up much space 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm
