hello welcome back uh runners are heading to out to the barriers uh here is number one the one-word profit gain have have three winners uh three runners uh through them we talk about that is number six uh ricky well harry this horse is a very good sandhorse but uh he ' s uh certainly been off form for a while he ' s been racing poorly for a long time franco i couldn't make a case for him whatsoever number seven is pleasure giver it ' s come up with barrier one saddle slipped forward in the run last start he was beaten six and three quarters behind to each his own so it was inconvenient on the same day flying dragon uh was in the lead at palace run and they ran well a good half second quicker so  some excuses for one-word pleasure giver gets a bit weak at the finish but he had he ' s a winner at the distance and barrier one that ' s going to help yes and probably he will lead them that uh draw uh of course stephen cheung ' s a very good barrier jockey so no worries for him and finally as number ten uh metal gear he ' s a stayer and he ' s definitely heading for class five again and he hasn't had much preparation franco hard to make a case for him so harry your selections for the race franco originally i put number nine on top the windfall i i think he ' s a very very good racehorse just a wee concern over his fitness and i ' m going to go the way now with the value of number eight  all smooth i ' m gonna put eight all smooth on top to beat nine the windfall  and number one profit gain next best now having said that i ' m leaving out flying dragon and well known who both have good records on the sand but you can't pick them all so little bit of one-word  i ' m going eight nine and one as runners make their way towards the start we ' re three minutes away from uh starting race seven well harry you stole my thoughts and i also like the chances of number eight all smooth in this race i thought this was a very tricky race so i ' ve gone a bit of value now he was around the mark of thirty-one it ' s now down to nineteen so all smooth the horse to beat in the race from a numb  number seven pleasure giver probably he can lead from barrier one uh definitely he would like to run on this kind of surface now pleasure giver uhm for third uhm it ' s gonna be very hard to leave out number nine horse uh the windfall horse with lot of ability but it doesn't uh show that he has good form so far maybe perhaps he uh needs a bit further but still very short at the market now four-words  and with the well with respect for number four well known he has a very good jockey louise corrales on in the saddle so it ' s hard to leave him out too so i ' ve gone for eight seven and nine and four  it ' s currently about uh two or three minutes away from start of race seven the favourite is still number nine the windfall and he ' s ahead of two horses number two flying dragon and number four well known as we now welcome back captain steve mooney with his selections for race number seven  thanks franco uh again there appear to be a a few legitimate winning chances in the race i thought profit gain is a touch of value at ten to one he ' s run well his past two starts including his latest second at repulse bay over a thousand and fifty surely might be suited by the thirteen hundred metre trip tonight so profit gain for me to defeat two flying dragon  leaden fought on well last time when second to lido palace he was helped a little by the bias but i think once again tonight it is an advantage to be leading he ' ll also have to do a bit of work uh to cross  two-words  you ' d still though have to rate him one of the stronger chances the windfall number nine i ' d throw in for third a chance again uhm good effort behind toy ' s dragon last time over a thousand and fifty but just happens each and every race the uh favourites are always just uh too well supported he ' s by no means an odds-on chance  gone one two nine and i thought number seven pleasure giver another that could run well in a double figure quote  uh the saddle did slip last start he was entitled to finish a little clo closer than he did then under the circumstances to finish fifth was actually quite a good performance  he would like you know to take up the running from barrier one and uh if that ' s the case he ' d have to uh be given a strong chance in the race so i ' ll go one two nine and seven as the main chances in this seventh event  well no and you can't tip them all but he continues to finish close up i was looking at him more towards the minor end all smooth didn't have uhm much luck his first run back this season and he ' s another uh looked uh logical improver  he ' s a big quote at twenty to one  this uh on paper really was one of the more difficult contests of the night i went one two nine and seven  profit gain good quote of around twelve to one  he ' d do me  louis corrales is riding four well known had six races and louis has been victorious in four of them so far  doubles to trainer paul chan and also trainer stephen cheung  well known is strong in the qs with the windfall he ' s met with good support both his uh starts the windfall did run better last time  has the services of robbie burke he ' s a son of naturalism out of the sir tristram mare sensual so pretty good breeding there for the windfall  beginning looks uh a strong chance in the race but i wouldn't rate him anywhere near even money  but again the favourites are jumping unders all night and they still can win they don't know what price they are  you see well known in the white cap there at the back of your screen  fifty-four dollars he ' s on the turn  louis corrales aboard all smooth the grey the pink cap  metal gear couldn't be having him on the sand he deserves to be a good uh a big quote in this and also should be dropping in grade after the run  ricky is another out of form he needs more ground so hard to see ricky getting close to these at all  there ' s the favorite the windfall as you can see uh it ' s very much on the turn  robbie burke to guide the windfall for k k sin  just on the turn and and the barrier attendant ' s going to bring him closer to the starting stalls  all smooth ' s sweating up a little but that ' s understandable it ' s uh little warm outside  here ' s a good look at all smooth the son our poetic prince and didn't have much luck at all in his most recent appearance of the race it ' s uh look like one that could run a little better this evening and big odds to do so at twenty to one blue light is now flashing for the seventh event and there ' s the windfall really he ' s on the turn and the impression that he he will improve with this run under his belt tonight  he ' s been like that since he ' s got to the barriers  just playing up a little  there ' s not really too much uh else i think we can say about the race  there ' s been spending out for all smooth his quote uh twenties down to twelves now so he ' s the favourite get down to twenty-five dollars profit gain got down to a double figure quote but again he ' s just been specked in slightly to ninety-seven dollars  spot market getting a a little more true now as we are close to a start and good calls for this race also already uh over half a million dollars in the win pool  and the q sees the four and nine combination favourite still at five to one the next best two and nine that quinella currently showing six to one  so we get the red light they ' ll start loading it ' s twenty five dollars now for the windfall little bit of specking for all smooth at uh one hundred and twenty-eight dollars  they are now starting to load as we cross over to harry troy for the call of race number seven thanks steve it ' s been a good betting contest even though the windfall is favourite  it ' s been plenty of confident support for profit gain flying dragon eell supported well known of course with louis corrales shooting for five wins and even number five millennium falcon has been well supported again tonight so good betting contest the best outsider the best backed outsider has been all smooth  now this favourite ' s been on the tote right from the word go the windfall and whatever he does tonight he ' s gonna to improve uh upon that just looks like the run might just top him off but he ' s a very promising type and they ' re set and ready  off and running getting out quickly on the outside pleasure giver metal gear with no speed and likewise all smooth gets back and nearly par with ricky now coming out in front is the windfall and he leads them as they go by the one thousand very hard ridden on the inside millennium falcon trying to go with him getting to third is uh flying dragon followed then by grandia who ' s prominent tonight as they go by the eight hundred just on the backs of them was uh pleasure giver followed then by profit gain well known ' s a good way out of his ground all smooth tacking on followed by ricky and metal gear the tail-ender they ' re going along at a pretty good clip and as they go to the six hundred getting up on the inside millennium falcon joins the favourite the windfall having the runner of the race back behind them flying dragon in third followed then by grandia profit gain then came pleasure giver he ' s never been going that well well known with plenty of work to do and all smooth ' s taking some ground on the rails from ricky and metal gear on towards the corner favourite looks good the windfall he strides clear getting into second spot is flying dragon running on just fairly grandia and profit gain but nicely clear as they run at the two hundred the windfall is out by two lengths in second spot flying dragon running on just fairly then pleasure giver but in front the windfall kept going by robbie burke and he ' s going to win quite comfortably the windfall is going to win by four on the wire to flying dragon now running on well for third is pleasure giver followed then by  all smooth grandia not too far away profit gain well known didn't run on followed by metal gear next to the wire then was ricky and last of all millennium falcon a nice racehorse and he strode nicely clear  in the final two hundred got away from flying dragon pleasure giver ' s run on ok and he finds himself in third spot and the best of the rest would be uh grandia all smooth didn't run on that well likewise well known and even profit gain who ' s normally a very consistent horse  over this distance but all honours with the winner number nine  and that ' s the windfall robbie burke running for k k sin a three-year-old bay a brown australian big gelding by naturalism from the sir tristram mare sensual  and robbie burke riding for k k sin number two is second flying dragon peter lao alan ngai  and winding up in third i think you ' ll find is number seven pleasure giver stephen cheung riding for alan leung officially fourth number three grandia  and christian reith rode grandia for joe barnes so nine two seven and three nice type good win and plenty more wins in store this eye steve it was a nice effort i was very on edge uh from the time they got into the parade ring uh to the time they jumped so uh as soon as he learns to settle and learn a little bit more about the game of racing he certainly has a good future should have good speed out of the gates and and robbie burke in the stride just having a look uh  on his outside to see uh how they were going behind him because i think he knew he had a lapful of horse and just gave the windfall a couple of persuaders and he really has won quite well at only his third career start and what ' s resuming tonight really could only improve with that run officially won by three and quarter lengths there ' s another three and a quarter lengths between second and third and the first two horses were both strongly supported again uh  closer to the one-word jumping evens in three to one and there was a big betting race the pool ended up very big and at one point seven million for the win pool  nine two seven officially fourth number three grandia ' s run a little better on the sand tonight  the windfall australian-bred colt by naturalism out of the sir tristram mare sensual owned by po ying wai cheung yin and partners k k sin and robbie burke combining  robbie burke ' s had a good uh start to the season  currently second in the jockey ' s premiership behind louis corrales with four winners tonight they ' ve run one at twenty point two over the thirteen hundred metre trip and the other division ran one twenty point five the event taken out by toy ' s dragon so he has run quite a bit quicker nine two and seven the windfall returning twenty dollars and ten fifty flying dragon ten sixty and pleasure giver running in third at fifteen forty the quinella fifty three fifty that is seven hundred and seventeen dollars three and a quarter by three and a quarter won twenty point two just repeating it was a touch quicker than toy ' s dragon who uh ran one twenty point five in the fifth event  so that should uh get another winning list growing the windfall and looks to have a nice future that ' s only his third run his all his runs are being spaced so they ' ve taken their time uh with this three- year-old  of course it did come here as an uh as an australian-bred two- year-old so he ' s still maturing and evidence tonight he really is still learning what it ' s all about sweated up was on the tote prior to the uh running of the race  but it didn't matter he showed good speed out of the gates travelled very well and he ' s gone to the line how a favourite should few disappointing runs in the race profit gain got back and didn't run on and even all smooth and well known a little disappointing nine two and seven though are the numbers we ' re just about to head to a commercial break we ' ll be back with the confirmation shortly commercial break welcome back live to tai po racecourse still awaiting the weighed in sign for the seventh event was taken out by the windfall for k k sin and robbie burke in fact it is all now official twenty dollars to win ten fifty to place for the windfall running in second was flying dragon at ten sixty pleasure giver third at fifteen forty the q fifty-three fifty that is seven hundred and seventeen dollars three and a quarter by three and a quarter one twenty point two was the run time  should we have a look at the head on replay if you have a look about now robbie burke just had a peek to his uh outside just to see if anything else is uh travelling well behind him here he was and uh flying dragon was the only chaser and just hands and heels  he ' s still he ' s still a young horse doing a bit wrong here changed strides a couple of times but uh essentially he ' s uh  been able to do the job again tonight uhm he ' s a horse that ' s just going only going to improve with racing flying tur dragon sticks on well and pleasure giver really the only horse just making up some ground to grab third profit gain ' s the widest runner out wide but he ' s failed to really impress
