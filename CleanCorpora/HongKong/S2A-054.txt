""
""
uh let me start by calling up    my new system  
""
right    let me give you a briefing a little bit of the background in
the beginning 
""
uh how does cad cam come from
""
well it  ' s uh not actually quite    uh fixed on the date
  it all
begin with the uh    spare    technology    o    after
the second world war
""
uh the radar technology which is used for the display    and all the
computer technology 
""
this is the uh computer in those days 
""
and it  ' s in    walls    and    room full    of it
""
and this is probably just one meg of memory 
""
and of course today you can fit all of those into a little pcb
board like that and already most more than the uh uh last two pictures in
this middle area 
""
and until the nineteen fifty this man probably is    recognized as the
father of cad
""
he joined the computer technology and the uh    radar technology and
he draw lines    on    interactive 
""
he put in    points    join them erase them move them about
""
and that  ' s about the recognized beginning of the cad  
  he is
called ivan sunderland
""
and these are the uh mini computers in those days and it  ' s very
large
""
and you can see it  ' s quite similar to the radars 
""
and that is the mainframe computer 
""
and this is quite modern one is in the sixties    end of sixties 
""
  we  ' re    using that already to uh do computer aided design
""
the example is that it is a goblet being uhm drawn on the
computer
""
it is in the form of a wire frame  
""
and to uh provide a surface and the solid model onto this wire
frame you can present it to the computer as an object 
""
and in those days    they are already using advanced technology like
texture mapping onto the goblet so that you can see it  ' s a uh
actually on the surface of the goblet
""
but it  ' s actually not the same thing
""
it is by a technique called texture uh    texture mapping  
""
so they are already doing things like uh uh futuristic
architectural design visualizations 
""
uh in those days the fly through of     
one-word    try to fly through of of the city uh all done in
wire frame form
""
they do not provide    solid    surface because it  ' s
just cannot    codified by    computer  
""
uh advanced simulation is uh also being used in those days
""
i apologize for the quality of some of these pictures because i use
a uhm amateur scanner to uh video scanner to capture these pictures 
""
and uh    another application in uh those days are in advertising
""
this is a uh computer simulation of a uh animation of a uh shaver
""
it is a uh milestone in those days that means cutting actually
  one words    according to the power in cutting all the
little bits of    one-word    area
""
doing that kind of advertising uh film is quite expensive
""
it takes a long time to calculate and work out the uh each picture
and frame the picture    con    consecutively then you will have the
animated picture
""
i think doing that frame in    is i was told that it is seventy
thousand us dollars per set    multiple words  
""
and also if you are doing things like uh    scientific
visualization which can only be done in the in the cad because you cannot
take a camera and go to the    place    and take a picture  
""
they were using computers like these 
""
this is probably the most powerful computer in those days
""
it  ' s called the play one
""
and uh you see areas of    bands    of discs to support it
""
it is for arrange in a circular form because uh it is a
multi-processor and between the processors they want to get the wires as close
to each other as possible
  the shorter distance there is less time for the
electron to travel
""
and because    two words    the central core to put
  in    superconductor so that you can just add the bit little bit of uh
speed to your computer  
""
and they were doing things like uh natural phenomenon simulations
on uh uh and it  ' s taking a lot of calculation and working out the uh uh
natural phenomenon like sunsets clouds water and the new newly powerful
computer can do this in those days  
""
but of course these are old times and the new style is to do on
desktop
""
this is generated from desktop computer
""
and uh it  ' s doing quite remarkable uhm animations and which is
quite demanding for for for for the computing power 
""
the some of the things that is uh up to up to this date are still
cannot be done by    com    uh desktop computers uh these applications
which are uh simulations 
""
it takes a lot of calculation to work out the air flow and
the turbulence
""
for example    onto    uh this sort of uhm simulations
  that is
nineteen eighty-nine  
""
and another uh film is is the uh actual uh animation film
""
in those days they use work station to do it
""
but again    only about two five five years back
""
now uh everything is can be done on the desktop pc
""
they are also using uh    human beings together with and uh actual
uh computer generated pictures
""
and that  ' s growing into what we call    vtual    virtual
reality nowadays and this is virtual reality in the computer
""
and you can see that it  ' s quite realistic and two persons are walking
but you notice that they uh only got a    one-word  
""
and of course the real    gains    of the virtual realities uh
up to today is uh demonstrated onto this uh few things    such as a  
recognized in terminator two which the uh metal man actually is forming a
metal to man and uh man to metal and changing shapes all the time
""
and it  ' s really state of the art technology being demonstrated on
virtual reality is on the screen 
""
jurassic park which you will not believe this    dinosaur is being
drawn on is the cad model  
""
now back to reality and uh i come from uh hong kong productivity
council which uhm is uh semi government organization    with the    uh aim
to improve the uh productivity in hong kong industry
""
and i look after the tax service center
""
and this is the hong kong pc unit    in kowloon tong
""
we have uh quite a number of departments from environmental to
electronics to computer services 
""
so uh and cad cam is part of it 
""
so what is cad cam
""
it comes from cad
""
cad  
""
before they call it computer aided drafting because they just use
the computer to draft
""
but later on they found drafting can be used as design as well so
they call it    cadd    c a d d computer aided design and drafting
""
so uh on    ano    on another scheme    it it    combine it
together nowadays it is called cad computer aided design because drafting
comes with it
""
the other scheme is called nc numerical control    which you control
the movement of the a machine cutting by    nume    numerics and putting
computer to it you call it cnc
""
and if you join the computer directly to it we call it dnc direct
numerical control
""
so you work on the calculating part etcetera by data not by moving
you hand    one-word  
""
but this are now called cam cad computer aided manufacturer  
""
now joining cad and cam together we call it cad cam
""
so uhm but cad actually has got the data that the cam machine can
use
""
so if you not using the cad data into cam then you wasting half the
data away  
""
give you an example very simple one of the cad cam applications
""
you can see this in the hong kong pc logo sitting on a curved
surface
""
and you draw that by forming a model on the computer    and uh to
manufacture this thing out is quite difficult because to cut this surface is
  veri    very simple
""
but to cut it with this hong kong pc logo in the center is very
difficult
""
but it  ' s a piece of cake by a computer  
""
what we do is we use the    one-word    cut control
machine that this is actually a two part
""
  two-words    two actually is turning
""
  this is a particular    one is the model  ' s tool
""
if you follow this    plane and do lines across doing that zig zag
cutting then when that tool is turning and cutting then you remove the metal
""
but how it move can be    compu con    controlled by the
computer
""
and you can move x y and link the two with z
""
so in three dimensional you can form any form that you like  
""
but this is called the three axes machining
""
but if you add the dimension on    tilting the head    the x y
the x z plane and the y z plane then you got two    farth    two more
degrees of freedom which we are called we call that
five axes machining
""
and most of this can be produced by five axes machining including
uhm aerodynamic shapes turbine blades etcetera
""
but in hong kong a lot of applications are mould making
""
mould making you know
""
once you make the mould you have to turn it out in one direction so
uh so three axes is quite enough 
""
remember the hong kong pc    few    uh hong kong pc logo in here
and you cut it by forming the two parts
""
so what the two does is cutting there and lift it up go across go
down and cut again
""
so doing this six    second    action you cut the piece out
""
and of course how it move is controlled by the computer
""
and you have quite a lot of    hindrance    of uh doing your
cut
""
this is going down cutting it  
""
moving up going across going across go down cutting it moving up
going across cut down go down moving up so it  ' s one direction cutting
""
sometimes    one-word    you have to do one
direction cutting only
""
but the choice of various cuts that you can do is enormous
""
this is doing    rounding    and when you hit the surface you
  lift    the tool
""
and if you hit that way you just follow it through  
""
another way of doing it    is to cut it by    regulate  
""
so it  ' s uh it  ' s a lot of control that you can you can you can
use on cad cam
""
and this is the    best way of cutting it because the two is
actually moving on the surface itself not like the just now sometimes you are
cutting air and it  ' s worse time it  ' s more time    one-word
""
""
so actually two parts is doing that sort of cutting it out  
cutting    it out until it    reach    that and it moves to another one
clearing that and then it go round and cutting it 
""
these are the same we go down going round and lift the two
""
these are the same
""
so once you got the model    view    up in the computer you can
cut it up quite easily 
""
that is the final product which the i particularly make the uh two
parts quite coarse so that you can see the actual tool    cutting parts of it
""
but it didn't make it progressively very thin and you can have a
very smooth surface  
""
look at that  
""
since the television screen is very easy
""
but it  ' s very difficult to do it in manual manual means
""
operation is the same
""
you work out two parts on the model and    one-word
""
""
and you can    uh accept the part and put it into uh the pnc
machines cnc machines and you can ask the tool to cut the surface out 
""
this is the typical machine which we call a cnc machine
center
""
and it has got a machining deck in there
""
the tool is underneath here
""
and it  ' s called a machining center because it  ' s got a  
two-words    of tools that means you can uh the machine will change a
little robot arm to rotate it
""
these discs will rotate until the right tool is at the right
position and the little robot arm will take the tool and lower it
in the in in the machine in the cutting cutting deck
""
and with different shape and different places you use different tool
""
so this can be run virtually in an unmanned operation throughout
until the complete job is done
""
this is the the controller to control this machine
""
it has got a computer in it and it will accept data from and
communicate with other machines  
""
this is another type of uh cnc machine which is the cnc    fuel
  is the    one-word  
""
and it has got multiple tools and in profile of the actual cut is
at first controlled by the computers    within    as well  
""
this is an electrode of a camera uh
""
sometimes you don't cut the actual uh       uch    actual
product out
""
you cut the electrode and use something called a  
one-word    machine electrode    restarting    machine    if  
""
the principle is simple that this becomes one electrode
  the work piece is another electrical
""
you put heavy voltage across it current across it and when you get
the two next to each other the mould is then produced spark and it erodes
the metal and then forms the shape of the the uh the electrode 
""
so cutting this out is the same whether it  ' s electrode or
a product we do the same thing
""
we model it and then we move about the two parts and you take the
two parts to uh to to generate the    tool
