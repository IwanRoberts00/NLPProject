""
""
uhm there  ' ll be three reports   
""
one  is the graph   one  is the individual 
 and one  is the management
""
  i  ' ll briefly  explain what they are first and i  ' ll
leave you a few minutes to read   on your own  and  so that
 it won't be so uh strange when i  re  refer to it
""
they this is uhm if you  ' re familiar you say you  ' ve done
assessments   before right
""
if  you could tell me something about what you  ' ve done so that
would be i won't be like talking teaching telling you   things 
you already know
""
""
 oh okay okay  
""
 okay  
""
 alright  
""
 okay  
""
 okay  
""
 uh yeah  
""
 well  
""
okay now this is uhm  it 
""
this is some assessment i  ' d done in just like nineteen ninety 
 this kind 
""
uhm ninety two and ninety two
""
""
 oh right  
""
uhm where did you do   it 
""
""
 this   is in london
""
  at  that time was like everybody was doing it
""
and   when  you went to see a recruitment company 
 the first  thing they did is like hand you this  
questionnaire and you tick tick tick tick tick  and they give you
something   like this uhm 
""
""
 oh  
""
 yeah  
""
 uh ha  
""
 oh right uh ha  
""
 alright okay oh   just a one page then   or
two  pages
""
""
 yeah  
""
just one page that was one place   this was another place
""
""
""
 uhm uhm alright  oh
""
""
and uhm then this one was with a career consultant in uhm uhm
london back then
""
""
alright uhm uhm uhm
""
""
and uhm i don't if you familiar with roger hamilton  ' s uhm
stealth wealth
""
  well i was there this weekend  yeah
""
and that   yeah 
""
""
 you did you did this  
""
 oh   you did the
""
""
gave him my profile
""
""
oh
""
did you have to work  give  pay for this one
""
""
yeah
""
  like three  thousand five hundred dollars  oh god
 but uhm i looked at it worse comes to worse  if i don't learn
anything i can make lots of  contacts 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yup   that  ' s very true
""
""
so
""
""
sometime you go for the contacts more than
""
""
yeah i went there with a mind of the contacts   and
uhm  also you know you always pick up   something 
""
i think you have to be really closed if you can't learn anything
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah i think you for you you  ' d be very enough uhm open  
anyway 
""
""
 right   so uhm i   thought  it was
  hey  something different to do on a weekend
""
it  ' s not something i will do my whole life you know going to
courses all the time
""
no no no
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uh so you went for a weekend is   it 
""
""
 yeah  
""
i know it  ' s interesting it was good fun
""
""
i think he  ' s very motivational
""
""
yeah it  ' s   motivational and you know  gets you
say okay
""
the   best thing i took away  is that you just got to
go out and do it just do it
""
go out   take action  take action
""
  and  the more times people drums that into you and
the more people you meet    that  say
""
okay let  ' s take action   you  know it just  fuels
it    
""
so that that helps
""
it  ' s really good
""
""
  motiva  uhm uhm  
""
 the  random   
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
alright okay
""
  so  you are anyway you familiar with   all
these 
""
""
 okay  
""
 i  ' ve done   some   of it 
""
""
 yeah you  ' ve   done
""
 but  have you come across uhm cause see from there
""
have you come across the d i s c
""
  disc 
""
""
 yeah   that  ' s the   one uhm 
""
""
 yeah
""
i think    you have    some of  them
  they 
""
""
 this one  
""
 uh   this one had the disc at the back i think 
 
""
yeah  the disc here
""
""
 oh did it uh  
""
oh   right  one word  
""
""
 dominance influence   security and  
compliance 
""
""
 yeah   okay good    
""
okay so you you you familiar with this    i think 
""
""
but  i bet their our this for    is  the disc
    except that for ours there is an extra element here which
is the motivational     uh energy because they have found
that   uhm sometime   human may  need different uhm
similar in the d i s c   but  you need uh uh drive that that
drive sometimes is very high in  it  a person from internal whereas
others the drive is to come from it   external 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 okay  
""
 uh okay  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 oh   okay   okay 
""
""
 alright   okay
""
so uhm then you have this report of management and individual
""
  now  normally if this a corporate environment 
 then  the management will see this and we only give the individual
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
individual right   okay 
""
""
 so   but your case is is you are the person 
 you  can both  
""
now basically they are the same   except  in terms of
language
""
  this  one will be speaking in a direct  way you
directly and this one will  cord  if you see you as a third person
""
""
 uhm okay  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 okay  
""
right   okay 
""
""
 and   there is one extra element in here one
extra section in here which is called the work motivation
""
  this is  not found in the individual   for
 the reason being that this is supposed to be uhm an initiative of uhm
management    
""
alright okay
""
so basically those are the   differences
""
so  for our purposes we will focus on this one   it
has uhm  more things inside   so you might  like to have a
look at this
""
  i  ' ll give you ten  minutes and then i  ' ll come
back
""
""
 okay  
""
 uh  
""
 okay  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 okay good  
""
 okay that is  
""
 okay great  
""
okay   great 
""
""
 alright  
""
""
alright
""
""
thank you  the tape stops 
""
  okay let  ' s  have your comments
""
""
  take care   
""
uhm struck by the thing about like  she would accept changes
slowly
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
um i  ' m just sort of like try to think back because normally
 i was like quick to accept change compared to a lot my  
colleagues
""
most  of them refuse to   change 
""
and you know so this sort of like jumped up and  
surprised me 
""
but maybe  i may be slow to accept change in another kind of
environment
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 oh right  
""
yeah i think that here they are not comparing it you
""
here you are looking at yourself
""
""
right  right but you know   it was just worry
 i was just doubt was one   thing  really funny  
 
""
uhm  two words  conscientious like some of the
words here just like well uhm methodical uhm  i  ' m i  ' m very messy at work
  which it mean  you know my desk is a mess   and you
know  uhm filing system is   pile of papers 
""
but uhm yeah suppose there is a  system to the mess
""
""
 i know  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
i saw it you yeah because if you could be messy but   that  ' s
 just in your things   but  in your thoughts   
""
how do you think 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 yeah yes it  ' s   much more uhm you know okay one
  i  cannot do three until i  ' ve done one   you know but
yeah yeah that  ' s true 
""
""
 uh  
""
 yeah yeah yeah uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
""
""
conscientious attitude regarding policies and
responsibilities
""
my responsibilities yes     uhm policies just for
the sake of policies you know   not necessarily so that  you  ' ve
got really a bit annoyed at some of it
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
yup
""
""
  yeah and  uhm
""
consistent predictable quality of work 
""
yes i suppose it  ' s like i always turned out a high quality 
 standard  uhm details yes uhm  uhm i like the bit about like
being bullied by some other people and and yeah because that that is true
""
  because  it comes at a point you know just like
look guys you know we can all sit here and argue  and nothing  ' s going to
get done or if you want to do it your way fine do it your way   and
 i  ' ll sit back and then two months later when it goes wrong i  ' ll say i
told you so
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
okay the joy of    one thing  
""
""
 yeah   you know sometimes it  ' s just like you
know uh i say okay i  ' ll say it i  ' ll say it one more one   last time
""
""
you know these are the dangers and if you choose to  
ignore  it  you  ' re in charge   not  my problem
""
you know it  ' s not mean not my problem you know   you
 want to be in charge then you be   in charge 
""
""
 oh oh  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah you   have been told
""
""
yeah yeah   so uhm yeah  i do realise  
that that  ' s  difficult   sometimes 
""
uh at this uh roger hamilton weekend there were lot of very strong
willed people   then 
""
oh yeah it was like they were flying all over the place
""
  you know  that style
""
""
 uhm yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 is it  
""
 yeah  
""
right i i can see your point to i mean sometimes i say oh what  ' s
the point    i think so 
""
i  suppose different people
""
""
 yeah uhm and  
""
different people some people think so much faster and they know
exactly what they   want to do  i mean or maybe they just want
to do it their way without thinking of   anybody else 
""
and uhm yeah whenever i tried to do anything my way before at work
it was like oh no no no i had to sit back and think of what the boss wants
what the owner wants what your colleagues want or what your you know  uhm
the partner wants so just like or don't upset this person don't upset that
  person so yeah  i can see that
""
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah right  
""
uhm   and 
""
""
 yup   i do like low risk  situa 
""
uhm i don't know if i really rely one hundred percent only on the
past
""
uhm i  ' m not that that uhm you   know  sort of like
uh i  ' m not that kind of financial analyst type person but   uhm
 i won't go for very high risk   solutions that  ' s for sure
""
because that  ' s not me 
""
not with my money not with anybody   else  just like
""
so maybe that  ' s why i  ' m not rich today
""
i just don't take that risk   i recognize  it
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 yes  
""
 yeah  
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm okay
""
""
 oh  that it  ' s a low key non-dramatic person that
makes things happen without any fuss    
""
that was one of my unofficial jobs just like just like somebody
made a big mess and i say okay let  ' s go and clean it up
""
""
 uhm  
""
uh
""
""
and there  ' s a lot of things that you know they were going to
go wrong   and you just  say okay very quietly tell somebody
without going   through the official channels 
""
and so   you  you you sorted it out   before
 and it went really really wrong
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 oh that yes that  ' s true  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
uhm
""
""
and that  ' s why you been why i did
""
""
yeah
""
""
yeah this is uhm  quite interesting   yeah 
""
""
 okay   so this this first section  
actually  sort of gives a   summary  of   what you
 are
""
the second section is the one that uhm    people 
would like to look at in the same that because it  ' s suggestion on what you
could   do
""
increase  the effectiveness this is all working in the
context of a work environment
""
  because  i think they are quite a few of uh what
you  ' ve done  involve  some of them and also the others too they are
more on a social in a social context     so like being a good
mixer being a quiet person   and something  in a social
environment
""
well this one they have sort of uhm  uhm adjusted it so that it
would then fit in into   these five criteria yeah  so that in
terms of productivity these are   the things that 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 oh yeah  criteria  uh ha  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
that could be so true
""
""
oh   is it do  you do you have a   uh uh
 issue
""
""
 uh  
""
 time  
""
sometimes   because like  okay i know there  ' s x
amount of things well x amount of regular stuff that needed to be done and
then there will be this amount of ad hoc and then   that will 
be amount of like trying to avoid   a problem in the future  and
i usually wound it up wound up staying until like nine o'clock just to finish
the regular things
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
yeah okay
""
""
the whole day was spent you know  dealing with other
people  ' s problems
""
yeah that  ' s better i could deal better with my time in  
that 
""
""
 yeah  
""
i think that that seems to come up quite   a fair bit 
in your management of time
""
""
 yeah i know  
""
and also some of the regular things will be a bit boring as well
and i really didn't want to do it   so  okay later later okay okay
got to get the report in
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah uh uh   uhm uhm  uhm
""
and this will be your quality of work i think uh yeah but you have
a very high uhm  one word  commitment to quality
""
""
 i know  
""
of my own   work and  work that you know i put my
name   to you know  and that like uhm i don't allow  sloppy
  things 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah right  
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm
""
""
challenges the status quo asks why
""
i used to ask why why why and they tell you shut up you know be
quiet don't ask the wrong question
""
i had very strong character boss     who was uhm
 he had very creative ideas but he never  thought about  the
practical   implementation 
""
""
 uh  
""
 alright   so he  seem alike    the top
 the overall that  ' s all
""
""
  the same   
""
yeah and the problem was there were a lot of other people within
the organisation that were that type   well  they were like oh
you are you know we do this we do that and i  ' ve been sitting there you know
as one of the people that had to implement and be like hey  nice but and
then they didn't like that   
""
it  ' s all your   squashing creativity  which yes and no
i don't know you don't know
""
i don't know how that uh    how  that would
translate in another work environment
""
""
 oh  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
yeah uhm uhm
""
""
the  companies 
""
""
yeah it is it  ' s a matter of then you  ' re adjusting  
to each  culture of   the company sometimes  you just can't
question it anyway because    uh  you know but you say and
you you have bosses like that
""
you  ' re not going to get anywhere    they  just
let you down
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 that  ' s right  
""
and then you got colleagues that  uhm sometimes you wanted uh
wanted to try you know make some minor     changes but
because it was  it has something to do with like 
""
you step on administration  you know just little things you
know really so minor and they  ' ll turn it into big oh no into the policies
and procedures and you go to get permission and  just like  come on 
""
uh it  ' s also like i  ' ve been stepping on somebody   else  ' s
territory
""
uhm  so in the end you know you just don't bother
""
  just  too much work
""
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah that  ' s right uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
that  ' s true i think
""
uhm a lot of times that people have said okay you know this is
also very like uhm time dependent depending on where you   are 
at the time which is true   yeah 
""
""
 okay  
""
 uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm
""
""
so i mean if you were working in a different environment you
find it you may answer the questions    yeah uhm uhm   uhm
uhm
""
""
 totally different yeah i can i can see that  
""
uhm i  ' m just taking like what i  ' ve complicate   yeah
 basing on past experience   there  i go
""
""
 yeah  
""
  one word   
""
yeah to certain extent you can't help    
""
uh i know it  ' s a matter of how far people   that
influences  your development and your growth   yeah 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah uh  
""
 uhm   uhm
""
""
uh look beyond routine jobs  identify percent 
opportunities that would be nice
""
yup
""
""
uhm uhm
""
i love learning
""
""
yup yeah it
""
""
i just love it uhm
""
""
you know i think it yeah
""
""
  so more time  i  ' d learn more things you 
 know 
""
""
 how do you  
""
 you   continue with it
""
""
yeah
""
""
and your team   work 
""
""
 uhm  
""
yeah uh that that is sometimes  be  problem being sensitive
people
""
""
uhm
""
""
yeah
""
because like maybe i  ' m not i don't feel as though i have all the
answers so i  ' m not that confident and     you know sort like
i don't want to get yelled down for you you know uh you don't know what 
 you  ' re saying  
""
but i know in my heart that you know i  ' ve got  seventy percent
of it right    but that  that thirty percent that  ' s somebody
is going to just like  kill me  up there  yeah
""
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uh but you just don't  
""
possibly possibly also because you  ' re a very people person
""
""
yeah it  ' s funny you know   as i no  no it  ' s
true it  ' s   true 
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 yeah   it
""
it says you  ' re friendly and uh you  ' re a team player so i think
sometime that comes in that stops the person from too assertive   
 because very often people uhm equate assertiveness with  
aggressiveness 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah   there  ' s a very fine line    
and you know uhm especially in hong kong  where once you know it sort of
be nervous  one word   certainly out like  you are
like so bossy
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
""
 several words  same thing you know
""
  oh  you  ' re just  one word  you
know one of the senior managers so that that  ' s why you know you don't say
 several things 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
""
because i  ' m right and you  ' re wrong
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh
""
""
and your problem is solving you know yeah and
""
""
you know it
""
reading it like this it sounds that i  ' m not that creative 
 but uhm  it in my company i was like  a lot more creative than
 most    pe  so  it  ' s just the way
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
i think you are  ever judging from what i  ' ve heard about you
and what kk showed me a bit of what you  ' ve done
""
i think you are  uhm in this case it  ' s more of i think it
""
it it  ' s a problem solving thing rather than just a creativity
thing   because you  ' re  creative in uh how would i say  in
thinking uhm along different lines but   they  may not
necessarily be towards problem solving   immediate  problem
solving    well i see  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 okay  
""
 right okay   okay
""
""
yeah yeah
""
so like you you say for example you have a problem now so your uhm
creativity doesn't come up   immediately  to face that problem
now but you  ' re creative in saying okay i want to do this i can look at
alternative ways of doing   it 
""
but at that point in time but all this i find very often they are
linked together is because sometimes because of your uhm team  teamateship
     that can uhm affect the way you solve problems
""
""
 uh ha  
""
 right  
""
 right
