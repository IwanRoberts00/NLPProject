oh so you how long have you learn german 
since i ' m in year one
 
oh that means three years already 
three years
 
wow i also i learn french for five years
so i wonder how was your experience in learn learning german
was it harder to get up the beginning 
yeah quite hard quite hard
because as you know uhm it ' s similar to french that
 everything can be divided into male female and 
and the one more one more for german is uhm things can also
divided into uh neutral neutral
 
 uh ha 
 yes 
 male and female yes exactly 
 oh yeah 
uh oh uh let me see in french 
i don't think we can call it neutral but maybe in german it maybe
a quite different 
and i see that in german there are some letter 
one-word z and a j or k something like that which we rarely use in
english words 
 yeah yeah
 
 two-words v and all that 
 and the spelling is very difficult
 
yeah
so how do you remember the spellings 
not uh easy right 
uhm it ' s never an easy thing
 uh just write and write and write till i can
remember
 
 uh ha 
oh i see
so you ' ve learn german so i wonder if you like to go

 uhm actually the school i have the uh course is
not a a big school

england 
 
 uh ha 
 uh

uh uh school plan the whole thing from 
one-word 
oh you planned it yourself 
oh so you group yourself among yourselves 
and then went to went to these places
 yeah 
 no 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah 
uhm we divide we divided us into small groups
of course with your friends with your most ultimate
 friends
and then uh the school uhm i mean hong kong u
hong kong u only uhm only help us to apply for the 
 institutes there 
and then uh for the other things including the fees 
 laughs all are uh
 
 uh ha 
 oh 
 yeah 
self-paid 
yeah self-paid and how much you pay that
 
 so cost 
so it must cost a lot 
cool really really
uh for the for the course

the whole trip 
no only for the course

so what do you plan
what ' s your 
 ba 
 it ' s very broad you know 
since as you know i ' ve study ba
it ' s not a it ' s not a professional it ' s not a 
tut 
yeah uh quite right
it ' s not a professional job
uhm i don't think i can enter some enter into some
professional firms
 i don't know but uh tut 
so in this moment i ' m just busying at my homework
i ' ve no time to find a job yeah
 
 yeah one-word yeah
 uh ha yeah uh ha 
 to think 
uh so how so i want to ask you
so will you find a job in the summer vacation or will you have
another uh outing
 will you go to some other places or you wait for
i mean are you going or you will find a job after your exam
or will you go for ho another holiday 
 outing 
i do want to have another holiday and or another
traveling 
yeah but uh tut uhm
maybe in reality i can't do that
because i think i have to find a job
because uh i think usual my exam at in
the in early june
 
 uh yeah cause they don't come two-words 
 
yeah 
and after that i ' ve two camps to go i ' ve apply 
 ap 
 
 you mean the church camp for 
uhm the the 
 
 one-word orientation camp 
uh the camp of the christian association in hong kong u

 yeah 
so uh it ' s not church but the christian association the
fellowship in hong kong u
uhm i ' ve two camps to go and then uh
maybe i don i don have time in june 
but if i go travelling in july and august
i think it ' s too late for me to to to find a job

 oh 
 too much uh yeah too much 
uh ha
so what do you plan to do
what what job do you take
i i mean uh like teaching or you know in
 one-word 
 oh merchandising 
 what job 
 merchandising 
 yeah 
 oh no no no no
i just
 
oh okay
i thought you like merchandising 
no uhm i haven't considered yet but 
actually actually uhm i ' ve planned to teach in primary
school
 
 oh okay you start to think one-word 
uh ha 
because uhm i found that i uh
 
like children 
 laughs 
to a some extent yeah so uhm 
i ' ve uhm i think i i would like to to have contact with
children 
uh i like to communicate with them
 i want to uhm if they cry or i want to uhm tut
i would like to talk with them and to understand them more 
 uhm 
 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah that ' s right 
 so uhm so primary teaching is one of my 
 my career or my something yeah my goal
 you ' re right 
and and i don't know
 
 uh ha 
 goal yeah 
 uh ha 
yeah we have to wait you have to wait
i think it doesn't matter just work hard first
get good result and then things 
will work out later 
 yeah 
 so 
i think the most thing i have to tackle now is my assignment
you know 
 
 yeah 
you mean this one uh 
yes it ' s one of the one of them
one of them two more
 
 one of them uh ha 
two more wow 
 two more are coming 
 
 one-word especially during
this time you have to prepare for exam 
 so you must be very headache 
 yeah 
yeah tut 
and you know many relatives and many friends ask me
hey gladys what are you going to do 
how are you going to spend your holiday
it ' s 
 
 uh ha 
 oh everyone asks you this question 
everyone ask me this question and and everyone i
you know each time i answer i don't know uh uh 
 
 or and do you feel bad
i mean do you feel uh when someone everyone ask asks you the
same question
do you feel a bit annoy ac actually
because you haven't decided many things
and they keep on asking you
do you feel pressurize or 
 uhm 
 i don't feel pressurize because i 
know all of them concern about me
 they want 
 
 okay i just 
 okay so they really concern 
yeah uh i know i know what they
i know what they mean
i know they they really want to concern about me
uh but the only thing is i really don't know when where
will i go and tut and what will i do
 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
i see so
by the way have they decided
or uh any of them find a job 
you you mean my friends 
uhm some of them some of them
 and i know i know very strange
i know a friend uhm studying law also final
year this year
i thought also final year
 
 yeah 
 they had 
 okay 
you mean okay yeah 
actually she is not my friend but a friend of my friend 
 you know 
wow uh you know she has applied for some jobs
and the one of them has uh has has uh given her uh a
post uh which with four two-words 
forty two thousand forty two thousand a month
 
 okay uh ha 
 wow 
wow really how 
she is study 
 no way 
 really 
law
 
uh bb or
sorry
uh is it llb or 
llb
but not pcll 
i think llb
 
only llb 
only llb
 
wow that ' s so much 
see llb only
 
but what job is it 
i ' m not sure because
when i heard what forty two thousand a month and i ' m shocking
 you know
i don't know 
 
 yeah i know
is she is she the one of the best students ex 
 extraordinary 
 i think so
i think i think she is in the top ten or top fifteen 
 something like that
 
 oh okay 
 oh 
yeah
law is really difficult 
 laughs 
yeah
 
so wow
but that ' s a lot right 
 i can't compare with her you know 
i ' m just ba you know
 
 yeah 
yeah 
 laughs 
wow but many tertiary students earn about like
if they get about twenty thousand it ' s already a big thing 
twenty thousand it ' s 
 
 it ' s already good
but she has double 
yeah it seems to be a dream for me 
 it ' s only a dream 
 it ' s only a dream
actually uhm i ' ve asked some uh some graduate last from last
year
they said that the average the average amount is only 
something like ten thousand uh around ten
thousands only
 
 uh ha yeah 
so low uh ha
so by the way as you will be leaving
you know your university life and that all the
you know university schoolmates
and you will be facing another another environment in the
future
so i ' m one-word to ask you
what do you think you will miss the most during these three
years of you know in you ' re your tertiary life 
 uhm definitely my friends 
because uhm i would say i am very lucky
i can meet three very one-word close
friends very ultimate friends here
uhm before i enter university uhm many many people told me
that
uhm it ' s hard to find true friends in in the u 
yeah because uh tut you know we are over twenty
and it ' s hard to find friends over twenty anymore
because most of our friends are uhm are 
like uh tut 
i can't say that uh but
 
 uh ha 
 yeah yeah exactly 
 dating 
self-centred 
self-centred right
 self-centred and not eager to help 
others
but i ' m very very very very lucky to have uhm 
three friends 
three good friends that are very very very very true
is that true 
 true yeah
 
 uh ha 
 oh yeah yeah yeah i know 
 three good friends 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 true 
so it ' s one-word uh so loyal 
 sincere and loyal yeah 
 
 so are they are they from uh your bba as well or
from other faculties one-word 
okay so they ' re more closer you know 
 uh ba 
 yeah 
and four uh four of us are studying uh majoring in english
 
and three of us are minor min uhm minor 
in german
 
 uhm uhm 
 minor 
oh so was it the three of you went europe 
okay i see 
so besides the student how about the lecturer
let me ask you two-words 
 laughs of for the three years
you must have face different 
lecturers 
 two- words before we go to the lecturer
let me ask you subject
which subject do you like the most
did you like did you enjoy or did you learn the most 
 yes one-word 
 yeah 
 okay 
 yeah lecturers 
i don't know
 
oh i would nearly the same 
i mean nearly the same 
 uh 
 i don't know 
it ' s it ' s a quite it ' s a a 
it ' s hard to answer you know 
 
 uh ha 
okay how about how about the lect the lecturers
the pe uh which of them give you a good impression
you want me to tell you here all speakers laugh 
you want me to tell you now or behind the mic
 you know all speaker laugh 
 
 or or well maybe 
people will hear right 
 yeah 
uh it ' s quite embarrassing to answer you here you
know
 
 yeah uh 
okay so how long you go to say
what what quality did you uh
as well as you see you said you want to be a primary school
teacher
 and this is one of your goal
 so what what do you think you could learn
from your lecturer
the way i mean the way they taught you
the way they uh put everything it
organize things and all that
so what do you think you can learn from them tut 
 that you didn't know before
what yeah what good qualities did they process 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uh 
 i think being a lecturer it ' s very very very
much different different from being a primary teacher
yeah uh tut 
uh i don't think i can i can apply the
teaching method uh from the university to the primary school
because uh uh if i ' m really a primary teacher
the target uhm the students are all kids uhm or 
yeah under ten under ten uh
i have to really i have to love them
i have to take care of them
uhm i have to uh if there are some problem in my uh and in
my students
i have to contact their parents 
i have to communicate with their parents communicate with them
uh please tut it ' s very much different from the
life in university
 
 yeah that ' s right 
 apply 
 uh ha 
 yeah and you guys your one-word young
 one-word 
 yeah 
uhm
okay let me let me help you analysis your ability
will you what do you know we have the one-word /
unclear> things call swot analysis s w o t swot 
have you heard of this before
it ' s very it ' s quite common you know
s means strength w means weakness 
yeah o means opportunities and t means threat
okay these four things
so first of all what do you think of your strength for being
a primary school teacher 
 s w o t 
 weakness 
strength
 
yeah 
uh i would say i love no i love but i like children
 
uh ha 
i like children 
 
 yeah 
love like
you know if you do not like them it will be very hard for 
 you to face them
yes that ' s true 
 yeah 
 impossible 
and since you know i i teach children in church in
the some in the sunday meeting for the
children
and i i use to contact with children
i use to have contact with children 
 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah you can use yeah 
use yeah
so you have experience of
uh so you must
you also knowing that the problem you may face so
what are do you think are your weaknesses 
 yeah yeah 
i don't look like a te teacher 
 laughs 
 
oh how how
you can act like one-word 
many many friends told me that uhm i don't look like a
teacher
 
uh ha uh what what
why do you say that
what what do you think a teacher should look like 
uhm mature uh tut matu
i think the most important thing is mature
 but i am not mature enough
 
 uh 
 but 
 oh no 
uh ha or you don't think about cause
well you can change your appearance
you can change appear 
you can change your appearance
uhm you can wear you know
may perhaps your clothing you can just have a change 
 one-word 
you know i like t-shirt blue jeans and something
 i i ne i never dress in uh tut
 
 oh 
skirt 
yes skirt
 
 not not because you ' re fat in the 
 uh well sunny all speakers laugh
 
the the chinese people like that
they don't want to show their leg
 their leg are fat 
 the legs 
it ' s one of my problem
 
really one-word i don't
think so
 it ' s okay 
 really 
 really 
it ' s one of my problem
and uh well yeah
 
oh so you mean you ' re not mature
 how about what what opportunities opportunities
do you think you have 
 yeah 
uh tut actually i don't think there ' s much opportunities
because it ' s quite uh it ' s quite hard to compete with with
the graduates 
 
 yeah 
it ' s very hard right
uhm you see there ' re one-word some people
 are who are
i mean i mean they they ' re studying some teaching
uh aim at professionally for teaching right 
so they may have priority or greater priority 
 yeah hong kong i ed and for 
for example the one-word in chinese u
the lang the language they have of of a major
no what one-word they that
i had a friend who study chinese but she later on had a
certificate one-word 
we need to have a certificate right
 that ' s the main problem 
 yeah 
 you mean the hong kong i ed 
 and 
 yeah we need 
but uhm it uh i can had
i can study the course
 
and get get it later on or while it ' s 
 oh 
 later on 
 on the job
on the job training 
 
 okay okay
uh by the way i want to ask you uhm 
is it necessary to have a degree for teaching
it ' s a must is is it 
 it ' s a trend
it ' s a trend 
 
 oh but it ' s not a must 
not a must
 
oh it ' s not required by government 
but you know uhm know uh
if you have only got a certificate uh the the most probably
will you teach in pri primary school
 and but if you have a degree most probably will
you go to the college secondary school
 
 oh 
 uh ha 
how about if i have a high dip 
high dip 
 
can i 
uh i think if you have a high dip and a
and you also have a cert then you can to go to primary
 school 
 
 oh 
oh but not to secondary school 
actually i ' m not quite sure
but i also have a friend really have a friend
she ' s a girl and she only got a certificate a cert
as i mean the certificate
 
 two-words but but they 
two-words 
in in what
in teaching or 
in teaching in 
and then she and she ' s now teaching in a secondary school
 
 oh okay 
oh
but no degree 
not degree
 
wow so i can also be a teacher 
yeah right
 
oh
uh that ' s interesting i don't know that
as i thought that you know having a high dip can
never give me a way to study
you know one-word to teach 
two-words 
 i think you can try to apply for them 
 and then you
uhm i think you have to to take the course at night
 
 oh 
yeah yeah night time
yeah that ' s the only way 
oh i may try that 
yeah that ' s a good idea uh ha uh ha
okay so you 
 yeah 
 at night time 
 a part-time will do 
 uhm 
 it ' s also a way to go
 
yeah another way wow so uh
by the way what do you usually do at home
i mean i mean not now 
 sleeping eating
 
yeah that ' s why you ' re fat uh 
yeah all speakers laugh yeah yeah
i like i like eating very much
 
uh ha
