my hobbies is listen to music and go out to play football with
my friends
""
if uh i listen i like to listen in japanese music uh english music
and chinese music also
""
and i like to play football because uhm my friends also like to
play it
 
""
what are your foods preference
""
would you like to prefer uh chinese uh dishes or japanese dishes
""
""
""
  i 
 
""
 or   western dishes 
""
""
i prefer japanese uh dishes because their food will be uhm 
will be hotter  and spicier
 
""
which country do you want to travel 
""
""
i want to travel to japan because there have many  advance
technology and there have many games station and there had uh disland and the
and the  dis  inside  dis  disland uhm have  many good games
to play
 
""
you want to visit disneyland once once once again 
""
""
yes
 
""
why 
""
""
because there have many games that i have uh not yet play
""
and the view of there is very beautiful
""
and there have some hotel
""
and there have  manys  things about disland  i can  i
 i can go to buy
 
""
do you think of any advantages if disneyland is constructed in
hong kong 
""
""
yes i think disland can build in hong kong because there uh if
disland build in hong kong there will be more job to give the people in hong
kong and there will be more tourist come to hong to visit hong kong
 
""
uhm you can say it can attract many tourists then how could you
communicate with them if they ask you questions 
""
""
i will use english to communicate with them because english is
a international language
 
""
then how do you think about your english 
""
""
my english is  quite bad
 
""
do you think learning english is important 
""
""
yes because english is an international language and when we
trade with the foreigner we usually use english to talk with them
 
""
okay now the medium of instruction of your school is english do
you think it  ' s good 
""
""
yes uh because we can learn more english
 
""
or you want to be taught through your mother tongue 
""
""
uh what is mother tongue
 
""
uh that is chinese or cantonese 
""
""
uhm use chinese or cantonese is also okay because  i 
uh when you use chinese and cantonese  you can  dis  you can
discuss with your teacher easily and will not shy with that
""
if you use english sometimes you don't know that english word and
you  and you are shy to discuss with your teacher
 
""
how do you think your classmates  '  attitudes towards medium of
instruction 
""
""
i some of my classmates uh don't like english because english
for them is too hard to study
""
uh like some of  m  like some of my classmates uhm cannot uh
go forward to form two and they stay in form one
""
they think that english is too hard for them so i suggest them to
change to uh an chinese uh  ngh haih  an  s  secondary
school taught by chinese but their mother uh dislike dislike uh secondary
school talk by chinese
 
""
do you think teachers have to share a great responsibility of the
results of the student 
""
""
uh some of the  s  teachers need because when they 
when they take the lesson they just read through the book and give some notes
to the student and tell them to write down something and don't explain
anything
""
so if the students  '  result is uh quite bad they need to
responsible for that that but but if the teacher is quite good uh they
explain all the things in the book and  when the student ask them question
they will they will answer it
""
uh if the student result is also bad  uh they need not to
responsible for that
""
it  ' s the student responsibility
 
""
do you think teachers of your school are good 
""
""
uh some of them are good and some of them are bad
""
and i the
 
""
which teacher do you hate 
""
""
uhm the arts teacher
""
his nickname is leung  baak  
baak=an-elderly-person 
""
because when i attend the lesson he always say something is very
boring make us make us want to sleep and the some of the student sit at the
back  a  always take some homework to the art room to do and don't
listen to uh the teacher
 
""
which teacher do you like best 
""
""
uhm uh uhm about two teachers
""
one is my music teacher his uh his name  ngh haih 
her name is call  candy
""
and then and i like her because  sh  uh she  ' s kind and will
not punish student uhm easily
""
and then one more teacher
""
that one is my history teacher
""
because when there is exam uhm she will tell us many hints and and
he will  ngh haih  she will uhm  uhm make us have uh get a
good results on the exam

it needs to uh five thousand five hundred to attend the course but
just the course just last uh five days

uhm 
""
""
yeah do you think it  ' s expensive

and he and she invite me to  a  also attend the course and
i say wow it  ' s really expensive

but but she said uhm uhm it  ' s really worth to attend
""
uh after attending the course uh you will you will you will know
yourself more
 
""
yah 
""
""
yeah but i but i argue with her i say uh uh  if the course
the aim of the course is really want to help you to know yourself more uh no
need to uhm charge us five thousand five hundred
 
""
uhm 
""
""
you see what i mean
 
""
  yeah  
""
""
 it  ' s   not worth
 
""
  uhm  
""
""
 it  ' s   not worth
""
uh huh
""
and  when i ask her uh uh where did the five thousand five
hundred spend  yeah
""
i mean i mean uh spend to where
""
you see what i mean
 
""
uhm 
""
""
yeah
""
and she said it  ' s secret
""
she make a promise with the uh with the  or  uh
organization
""
uh i think she  ' s being cheated
""
 uh uhm as i said before uh i think she  ' s being cheated  by
the course
""
but uh because uh i know the course is uh divided into three parts
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
yeah  ngh haih   no  three levels 
yeah
""
the basic level five thousand five hundred uh  adva  uh the
the advance level or the     the upper but i don't know
""
uh i know it  ' s uh it  ' s expensive more more expensive yeah
""
uh she always phone to him  ngh haih  phone to me
and said uh why don't you attend the course
""
uh the course is uh uhm good for you
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
""
""
good for you
""
know yourself more
""
but and i i argue with her uh
""
may be i also know  myself more but uh i don't think five
thousand five hundred is uh really reliable
""
you know i don't i i don't think the course is reliable
""
and he said uhm may be you will uh know some uh uh theory
 
""
uhm 
""
""
yeah
""
in in this five  da  in this five-day course
""
so i said i  ' ll i  ' ll i  ' m i think i can i will also know uh in
the future yeah
""
it  ' s meaningless to spend to spend this uh five thousand to
attend the course
""
uh i i uh i hope you can get my point
 
""
yes yes
