welcome atv viewers to trackside
this wednesday evening we are at happy valley 
without any more ado let ' s go and pick up the live action with race
two 
so they are circling around behind the gates for the second at
happy valley 
number three billion delight is the race favourite at four point one
he has come down but the main move in the race has been for number five
rangeela 
he ' s tightened down to fifty six dollars 
enormous way has drifted a point in the last five minutes he ' s out
to sixty 
american champion steady at seventy eight 
the top one bon la vie just been a little easy at fifty nine 
enormous way uh the horse on screen at the moment at the moment has
been the real drifter 
yes i don't think it ' s got anything to do with the fact
that the uh the farrier is having a look at his foot at the moment 
he ' s obviously removed a plate or something and that is uh why
we ' ve got a slight delay to this race 
you can see the rest of the field walking around quite quietly
relaxed out the back of the starting gates there 
that ' s prodigy uh in shot at the moment 
those pink and cerise check colours 
they ' re uh pretty easily spotted 
go around with great consistency and this horse is a credit to all
concerned 
he uh very rarely runs a bad race darren 
but uh enormous way the horse who the farrier is looking at at the
moment is making is uh comeback for the season here tonight and uh there
weren't to many as uh improved horses as him towards the back end of last
year 
a winner of two of his last three and very much on the up 
however i ' m very much tempted to feel that the 1800 here tonight
maybe the minimum of his requirements now 
he ' s uh a horse that seems to benefit from a strongly run race and
a little bit further than just the mile the mile or a mile and a quarter 
he he ' s better over a mile and a half even 
okay well they ' re rounding them up in to the gates now for
the second race of the night 
let ' s take you to david

guscott second american champion comes out three deep 
bon la vie the rails 
next prodigy as they pack up 
from out wide enormous way rangeela next 
billion delight between runners 
super splendid cupid last 
they run the bend 
sir galway ' s still in front 
sticking on in the outside american champion bon la vie guscott the
middle 
behind them prodigy billion delight comes from a long way back 
battling on prodigy picking up with him 
on the outside american champion ' s sweep to the leader sir galway
sir galway battles hard but american champion went to him 
cupid prodigy coming late 
american champion just in front 
prodigy is trying hard with cupid and sir galway but american
champion wins a head 
sir galway fought hard second 
a neck cupid the middle third prodigy a head fourth the outside 
bon la vie behind them followed by billion delight guscott 
followed by enormous way and rangeela has pulled up last of all 
it was a competitive old go 
sir galway refused to give up but american champion had him covered
about 200 meters out 
they were stride for stride 
and whilst all that was happening cupid and prodigy continued to
stay on hard down the outside 
but it ' s american champion from the good gate in a perfect
position proving too good over the final stages 
american champion david oughton and douglas white combining again
barrier number one has helped them get in the prime spot 
he ' s battled on hard to the wire 
sir galway at no stage has given up he was in front and ridden
desperately by john egan 
he ' s just missed out in second 
it will be a half head margin if that 
and cupid in the middle has run third with a head fourth on the
outside to number seven prodigy 
as you can see he ' s only beaten a half a length if that 
it ' s a good four way finish 
and right behind them billion delight bon la vie 
and what ' s that on the rail 
uhm super splendid was it 
just looking at the book then when the last couple went past the
post 
anyway number eight first that ' s all that matters if you ' ve had
a bet 
it ' s still a photo finish and here comes the number eight is
first 
eight nine two and seven 
number eight is first american champion 
david oughton douglas white 
that ' s four from sixty nine his record now 
and it ' s his first win here over the eighteen hundred metres 
nine seconds sir galway 
a much better run tonight 
that ' s the second race we ' ve seen that he ' s on the speed doing
really well and two cupid who came home really nicely third 
hopefully he ' ll start to put things together now and he ' ll break
his hong kong maiden status soon 
so it ' s eight nine two and seven after the running of race two
it was only a short head by a head 
douglas white put him into the race a long way out uh
american champion took off leaving the back turn 
at that pint tsang was trying to improve on prodigy as well and he
was finding a few dead ends coming up to the home turn and uh american
champion 
an unimpeded run around the field and he finished best to win that
narrowly from sir galway given a heavy ride by john egan 
that ' s what he ' s like sir galway 
no pace tonight 
it was an easy lead and he ' s just been headed on the line 
chalk and cheese compared to his run here last time wasn't it
yes uh there was pace in that race and you just had to look
at this race tonight 
there was no speed so it changes the complexion for him 
but this horse the winner uh american champion has been
ridden far more prominently by douglas white than has been the norm for a
long while now 
and uh well to be perfectly honest i think he ' d improve again
from the run here tonight because he was definitely carrying far more
condition than he was 
for virtually the whole of last season i think he can uh still
improve a bit more and may just even win again now 
i don't think uh i still don't think he was fully wound up for
this tonight but a much much better improved performance 
and as you say just by ridden closer on the pace didn't have quite
so much work to do in the closing stages 
and that was very important in a race where there wasn't going to
be a great deal of pace 
it ' s amazing the previous race mark we saw them battle away
but they ran such a good time but in this race where the leader 
he kept rolling but he wasn't pressured hard in the middle stages as you said
he ' s set up a time that ' s equalled the class record 
one fifty and two is the record jointly held by po on power 
a very quick course indeed then tonight no doubt about it 
 commercial break 
so the placings on the second at the valley 
eight nine and two it ' s a big tierce seventeen thousand two
hundred and twenty seven in just the field of ten but uh all the favourites
have missed out 
bon la vie billion delight enormous way and rangeela 
so you certainly deserve your big collect there at least uh the
winner was some what in the market 
at sixty eight dollars fifty for those uh claimers six up to nine
they equalled the class record one fifty point two 
it ' s also a second inside standard 
fourth home was number seven prodigy
