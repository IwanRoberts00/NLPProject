how then is it possible to build up our history as a
respectable scholarly discipline
the same can be arts or literary history or cultural history if its
various objects come into being by in irrational and subjective process
it seems it ' s very very big question
in other words if this is the truth that we feel things that are
beautiful or we study things that that ' s more or less rational
uh uh through processes that are subjective right then we we
 one-word them in our mind or through our central
organs
so these are more or less subjective
if it ' s not purely subjectively because it depends on what is being
project projected to
for example if i if i uh if i open in your spotlighted 
just just direct them as you in in in in the dark wall tutorial
then you would have certain sensations that and not purely
subjective
you may subjective because we call but this is because i project his
life up to you so many what of light alright
so there are there are objective bases but still the reception of
these images these ways and the way it rest in your memory is can be
moves we call subjective alright
but the point then is as historian if the object of study is not
simply the projector and the and the uh at this
of course you can study how how uh this technology you know develop
you can dis you know there is always means and reasons for studying
that but this is not what we ' re talking about
we ' re talking about how how culture develops right
we we want to study how you as a au in as part of the
audience one-word this experience and what it means to
you
why you think that these kind of movies are really good or how why
you think that these kind of music that really good or these kinds of story
really enjoyable alright
so these are the things that you want to study as a as a
historian not as a one- word but as a historian as as a
as a as a conscious critic
so it becomes the compress becomes in the end you want to study
study you ' re you ' re you ' re tempting to study something that is that
is in people ' s mind right
it ' s one- word by every individual 
uh here uh william is is helpful because when he says that culture
has to do with community
he says that we are not a cult we are not a community if we do not
share some common things 
value as well as images value more abstract image is more
concrete alright
so a culture won't be a culture or community won't be a a
community if there is nothing in common that is share by all the by
more or less the people if you are if you you don't have to go to the
 one-word to find out
you don't have to do that
you just assume the people understand what you mean when you
involve some images when you in when you tell some jokes and when you you
know raise some questions right
or you when you are find yourself in mid of certain anxieties
you would expected at least some people share the some same feelings
otherwise this is what we call alienation which means that a
particular individual is isolated completely from the rest of a community
now if it is not always the case that everyone of us is alienated
then somehow we must be a community uh which means that we must have share
some some common values and common images
and the current culture we ' re talking about the one-word
 of cultural products or cultural events is the very important uh
or constitute a very important way of uhm making sure that these images are
there share more or less by people
and of course then is the cultural historian who study the ways in
which these share images and share value change
you see going back to kung fu movie
may be in the past you know people as a image for example of uh uh
i don't know of when you think of two-words you think of
 three cantonese words which is the name of a hong kong actor 
let say or if you think of uh you think of three words
 you know you think you know
but nowadays it will be different you know that the the the popular
icons
uh this is why popular culture become very very very rear
when you think of popular icon image is different the language 
now the question for study is the issue for study how has this
change come about
it means it ' s not enough just to say that you know chinese
literature is different from english literature
everybody knows the chinese wow somebody thought were they
they were the same but uhm uhm uh
identifying differences are always important but it is also it
is perhaps more important to unders to try to understand how these
differences come about
because if you don't try to understand how differences come about
then it ' s there are two possible outlets
one is you don't care alright
so you don't care whether uhm you well uh
if i ask you you want to see a comedy or see a film uh uh or or
tragedy i say you you could say i don't care i don't mind alright
so you are not sensitive or you are not you don't think the di
 the difference will affect you
that ' s fine but if we would also mean that uhm you would have
certain tragedies that you don't want to change alright
uh for instance uh uhm uhm three- words i
think i think you understand what i mean that that there are there are three
 three conceptions that it ' s always there and if you if you are so
 indifference to difference alright
if you are indifference to difference so let let say uhm in in
in in the united state for instance uhm uh u u united state is a country
where there are there are numerous communities and minorities ethic groups
okay obviou of difference or in china
alright there are so many different ethnic groups and languages 
alright so the one-word will be all differences
now if you say that i ' m indifference to difference alright
which means that uh either you are satisfy with one one version because
you are familiar with the most of the time and therefore you don't
care about other realities
you don't care about other variations that could be one reason why
you don't care
the reason why other people care may be because uh they are in the
position when they are always being judged apart by another standard alright
so so when you are in a slightly or more or less the privileged
position then you would be more sensitive to difference
so i say so so difference is something that ought to be very
carefully dealt with i think but because it is something that comparative
literature would have to
the difference between comparative in general i mean it i mean
the good things and bad things about whole concepts because if you say
general is good in the sense that it it de it has an attempt to go
beyond local situation go beyond provisionalism alright
 provisionalism is something that very very horrible as
if if you live in north point you only think you care about north point right
you know
that is senseless but the same applied to a city a country or a
region right
so general has this advantage of asking us to open up our
perspective but it also has dis disadvantage because and this is
where comparative can be of help
because in comparative you are asked to look at identities or
similarities as well as difference and try to account to the difference
alright
not just identify difference you know
a is black b is white but account for it
what makes a a or what makes a black or what makes b white
and when they put together what should be the result or what
should be the outcome right
so it ' s saying that if you live in what north point the other one
live in mong kok so i mean this is question you comparatively a lot of
people tell me that this point is a and that point is b
the reason why why you should go on to ask is so what you know what
you want to say about once you begin to compare two things right
because you know otherwise it will be pointless right
so you begin to come out of local uh and and and to try to be
sensitive to different and local situations
uh this is something that comparative what so mean
uhm i want to go to uh this things about 
two-words 
this this cha this article in uh uh since i mention
renaissance i think it would be your relevant 
 cult comparative literature as cultural history right 
the the point being make there is actually very simple but it it uh
it is certain uh demonstration of how literature or literary studies
could be done uh under a new paradise
uh in this new paradise the focus is not to study the aspect
 beauty of literat or literary value or literary work
but to try to analyse and understand how uhm how should i put it
how some set of criteria have been set up and maintain in a
particular period of time and history
and this case he ' s talking about renaissance literature and he ' s
talking about in the period of renaissance lit literature
how some educated how what the educational practices alright
what are the dominant schools of thought among the educators
among priests in particular
uhm intellectuals who have the power to say what is call
culture and what is not
what is the cultivated and what is the uncultivated alright and
attempt to study how these things come about in real terms alright
we help us to understand that a study is actually constructed by
human society by human community is with with the help of allow of
concrete social practices
education is not practice
uh writing in the newspaper or reading from newspaper is
another practice
uh listening to your parent is another practice or disagree with
your parent is another practice
uh peer groups in all all kinds of social practices come about in a
constitute uhm what we believe we share
what we believe the kind of value of images that we share that
somehow represent us as a community alright
so i would be this attempt is to is to see literature or
literary study or comparative literary study as being responsible as well to
try to understand how literature and all these other apparatus how they are
connected
compare it in a very very different sense 
not necessarily that is to say compare a literature a with
literature b or particular work in literature a with a particular work in
literature b but to see how literature as a categories is related to
all these various other categories that i could afford right
literary studies general literature comparative literature in the
case of hong 
in other case there is it ' s the same literature chinese
and english as well
and you can go back all the way to institutionalization in
university institutionalization in the school system
all the way back to primary education memory education
all of these are related 
uh person just do not come to read shakespeare when he is born or
she is born
right year year years of education and culture and
cultivation and training or distraining that allow people this allow
him to be a particular one part
so is it our test also to try to understand the this particular
processes alright
so i think it i mean otherwise it would be quite uhm frustrating
for a lot of people because they don't understand why they are studying this
and they don't feel they always they don't they don't feel always the sense
of sort of immediate and static judgment as immediate and static
acceptance of of uh uhm some literary artistic work
because of this huge culture gap uh because of the huge gap also
sometimes between an individual ' s training or history and social environment
in the social history alright
because i may have come from a background which makes me very
difficult to understand uh comedy for instance for example i mean
there may be some reason for that alright
and then you and and if you want to judge me or by the
way i react to comedy i mean it may be unfair to me alright
if you want to take into considerations such variations as well i
mean we i think it is my belief that in society as modern as as diverge
diverge as as we ' ll we have here uh there are a lot of variations that
are not just individual variations but it ' s a group variations 
alright
variations within the community and these variance then constitute
the community 
lastly last point very recently there is a different
attempt to understand history alright uhm history
because don't don't talk to people in history department they
won't understand it 
because ordinary history was also understood as symbol record
of the past alright
first it is records and and second it has to do with the past
or i means they has to do with uh the way past is connected to the
present and may be connected to the future just why we study history right
we want to understand the past in order then we can better
understand the present and the future
this is all very fine but it has this very obsessive 
attachment to time that i want to draw your attention to
i mean this process this thinking of this concept of history
base base very much in in temporal development alright
so i mean it ' s like how do we come about since the uh fifties and
sixties
how we come about since seventeenth century and sixteenth century
thinking always about human development in terms of time and this
is as i ' ve put it out already this is really role the fundamental
talents of western humanism alright to be historical
