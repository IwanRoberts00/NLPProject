welcome back the stock market finished the week on a fairly calm
 one-word  after some wild swings during the week in
response to china  ' s latest detest on the governor chris patten political
proposals
""
in the studio to look at where the market might be headed is simon
chin from citibank
""
welcome to the show
""
we  ' ve seen the the market rebounded before in the wake of china  ' s
criticism is is it more serious this time or will the market rebound again
""
""
""
i think the market uh well in the first part of the week the
market uh dropped quite a bit
""
it made two record  f  days you know by falling more than two
hundred points
""
and then it calmed down as people uh began to  t  to to think
hardly about the whole situation
""
but after all the market had a chief fallen by about ten percent
since uh black friday actually
""
and uh right now at this stage the market is trying to get itself
together and consider what will happen in the next round of discussion
between china and and britain
""
""
we  ' ve got some important dates coming up
""
for instance we  ' ve got legislative council vote on uhm whether to
go ahead with the nine billion dollar uhm construction of for the cite
formation at chek lap kok
""
then we  ' ve we  ' ve got the the the deadline itself which is the
thirtieth of november
""
uhm if you get uhm a hong kong government decision to go ahead and
this is then uh supported by legislative council  ' s approval of funds and if
china then comes in and say if you do that we will unilaterally abrogate the
memorandum of understanding
""
now in that scenario how would the market react
""
""
i think in that scenario uh which i don't believe it would
happen that they will they will uh disregard the mou
""
but if in that scenario i would say the market will have uh  f
 further  down  downfall like  to the even to the five thousand
level from today  ' s uh five thousand eight hundred level
""
and i i i mean i have i would emphasize that china will not uh 
s  uhm say that the whole thing will be scrapped
""
and at this stage i  ' m sure that both side are trying very hard to
find a solution to the whole situation
""
but the market is actually discounting the possibility that the
whole thing will be dragged on for quite a while   and 
""
""
 the   the thing cannot drag on for too long
because it is not in china  ' s interest to have it dragged on for too long
""
uhm some people have suggested that this could drag on until the
middle of next year
""
if if t does drag on to the middle of next year than of course this
would could conceivably be linked with the uh negotiations with the united
states over the  uhm most-favoured nation  ' s stats and   and 
that would be problematic for china
""
""
 right  
""
right i think at this stage the well china has voiced its opinion
that they  they don't like uh the the legislative council to vote on the
financing arrangement
""
and uh it is  c  uh based on uh  s  several  se
 uh various sources
""
it  ' s quite expected that uh uh the uh council will approve the
financing for the uh for the cite formation
 
""
china expects this do you think 
""
""
i would say the investors
""
and i think
""
""
oh the investors   expects this 
""
""
 well i  don't i don't know china what china expects
but at at this stage i think uh china probably has taken that into
consideration that it would go ahead
""
but in any case the whole thing for the for the the  pro 
for that project that nine billion project will be completed before nineteen
ninety seven
""
so in that sense uh china really doesn't have much say with regards
to to to that particular project
""
but in the overall picture     then china will have a
will have its own view
""
and uh  one-word  on that basis investors are
quite concerned that uh uh the the the airport may be dragged on for some
time
""
but it seems that from our opinion uh i would say that the the
airport will go ahead but it will take awhile
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
so  so far in the heavy weight for a fund fund manages before
this week of manage to ignore the political risks in hong kong you know
looking at the fundamental which is still very strong
""
we did see them them pulling their stocks out this week
""
is it something that hong kong is going to have to be particular
cautious about the fact that the political risks are really coming into focus
now 
""
""
right actually in the month of october uh the market has gone
from five thousand eight eight hundred to six thousand four hundred largely
on a basis of some us investors buying into the market
""
and in the past week the big uh drop in in the in the stock market
uh uh index or the stock prices
""
oh are we not what we  ' re not due to selling by us investors
 
""
uhm 
""
""
us investors they seem to be quite calm and uh either they are
calm or they  ' re ignorant
""
and at this stage they are they are not paying too much attention
to the uh political situation and uh firstly because the hong kong portion to
them is very small
""
it could be three or four percent of their total portfolio
""
and they don't really need to be so uh careful or cautious about
the whole situation
""
they they can afford to take a longer term view
""
uh in fact the past week or soon the heavy selling were coming from
the local investors or local fund manager and uk fund managers
""
""
the the us money probably came in because you had a two bits
of good news
""
one uh the resolution of section three o one
""
uh china did agree with the  unite  united states government
""
and secondly because uhm in in the view  i  in the views of
most people china had a good fourteenth congress
""
but of course uh us investors probably don't know what  ' s going on
in hong kong
""
uhm probably ignored uh precautions which mr patten  ' s
constitutional package could create
""
and uh if the market goes don further very dramatically then they
would have to reconsider their positions of this wouldn't they
""
""
yeah if the market falls further and uh they would start
scratching their heads and and wondering what  ' s actually going on in hong
kong
""
and and then also uh brokers will be calling them and explaining to
them then situation
""
and sometime it depends on on these brokers  '  viewpoint
""
uh if they paint a lousy picture then they might be jumping into
the bank wagon and start to sell
""
uh but at stage they are still quite calm
""
and uh in fact i  ' m aware that uh some of these us fund managers
are long-term fund managers
""
uh thinking about buying back into the market uh at about uh if if
they see another two hundred points drop it on the index
""
""
  but  what what what is really important of course
is is not where the index is but what the pe ratio is now
""
i i regard the current impasse between britain and china as
possibly quite as bad as the darkest days of nineteen eighty three nineteen
  eighty two eighty  three during the the last sino-british
negotiations
""
so uhm i don't think there is you know any ground for optimism
except for one thing i i like you i expect irresolution     of
this current impasses to be  re  you know to to to to to come about
rather quickly
""
we can't afford to have this drag on for too long
 
""
 how   
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
 
""
how far or how bad do things have to get before the heavy weight
start pulling us serious amounts of money 
""
""
well uh well say for instance uh last time when uh uh zhu
rongji in in london he mentioned he was misinterpreted probably he mentioned
that uh there was no need for china to hold up to the uh joint declaration
""
and in fact that  ' s sent the index down you know more than two
hundred points in one day
""
and of course subsequently uh chinese press clarify that uh
statement and and and the market became calm
""
so i think uh at this stage the market will will  pro  must
have digested a lot of the the existing bad news
""
and it  ' s waiting for both sides to to come out with something
""
uh like uh uh actually uh two days ago the market dropped something
like two hundred points and then rebounded in the afternoon
""
and and it seems it seem that the market is coming up without these
rumours
""
and people uh want to hear good things
""
and if they sense something that uh chris patten is changing his
position or britain is more flexible or or the chinese sides is more flexible
they makes they make stories up to to jump up  one-word 
up the market or to send the  ma  index down
""
i think at think stage the market is very much rumour-sensitive
""
and they may have wishful thinking of their own
""
and they sense the the index  v  to become very very
volatile
""
  and 
""
""
 i   i i would i would say uhm a lot of these
people who are uhm investing in hong kong need to have uh some understanding
of chinese politics
""
anybody who told you that zhu rongji would be going to britain to
offer  one word  of branch need his head examined
""
because zhu rongji has just been elevated to the politburo  
standing committee 
""
he is a new boy  in a very exclusive club
""
he  ' s got to make sure that he would not upset people like jiang
zemin and deng xiaoping     or li peng
""
and therefore he is not about  to risk his own political career
for what is an airport and the constitutional package in hong kong
""
uhm three years hands or five years hands when he is in a more
secure powerful position within the chinese leadership he might be  uhm in
the position to help but certainly not now
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uh uh unfortunately the stock market or or or investors in general
are not as rational as you are
""
and in in the bull market that that has been going on for the last
two years and people they tend to think positively
""
so they they always would like to see something that would calm
them down make them happy
""
and uh on this trip by zhu rongji to london they they hold all have
a  wish  wishful thinking that zhu rongji is a is a open-minded uh
fellow
""
he he would have come up something to help the whole situation out
""
they would disappointed
""
and they even heard something harsh from mr zhu
""
so they they  this that send the index down
""
and and at this stage i think the the market is getting very
sensitive
""
and people want to see the index go up but they have to find some
excuses even though excuses may be rumoured
 
""
i  ' m afraid we  ' re going to have to leave it there thanks for
coming in that  ' s newsline
""
join us again next week
""
good night  
""
 
""
uhm yeah
""
going back to welfare question
""
is the uh probably the elderly going to get worse and worse year
by year inevitably 
""
""
uhm
 
""
as people live longer and there  ' s there are fewer jobs for say
people in their fifties 
""
""
yes indeed a a few days ago when i was uh  uh analysing
the the future  uh so to speak burden   on the  welfare
system
""
and in fact in the whole government right now uhm the  o 
overall spending on the standard rate i  ' m just talking about the standard
rate on the cssa that other other other other spending    
for the elderly uh  it accounts for one point five percent of the
government spending
""
the total government   spending  one point five spend
on cssa elderly standard rate
""
but if looking at the current rate of growth in terms of elderly
and poor elderly in thirty years time that one point five percent grows to
fifteen percent    of the  total government budget which is
even bigger than the total welfare budget which is right now only closely
eleven percent of   the  total government   spending
""
""
so that you know burden is increasing
""
and and i see no way the mpf will help them because right now we  ' re
talking about the cssa which is only helps to  about eleven percent of the
elderly population which uh the  one-word  the bottom
 one-word    of 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 the bottom   of    bur   
""
""
 yeah   of the whole whole elderly person
""
and even  th  thirty years later they are still at the
bottom
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and mpf you know you know their their approximare something
like thirty percent of the elderly population who do not have more than ten
years working experience
 
""
uhm 
""
""
so even when the mpf mature in terms   of  in a
  few years time there  ' s still twenty to thirty percent  pe 
people who don't even have single penny     safe in the mpf
scheme
""
and even for those within the mpf scheme we know that the lowest
quarter would   be  unable to earn a  l  well to to to
live on the mpf
 
""
 they will  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm   uhm  
""
""
 so   that we  ' re talking about something forty
percent
 
""
  uhm  
""
""
 of   the total population thirty years later that
uh who cannot rely on   the mpf 
""
so so we  ' re still talking a very large group of people who rely
on the society to help them
""
  and   s  so the mpf doesn't really hep them
""
so i will see burden be  incre  will be increasing
""
and that for people in the social welfare we we suffer immediately
because when there  ' s a growth in elder population we will increase spending
there and we will forget all the  thi  other things like disabilities
the families   the  child uh and and and lot of underprivileged
uh people     would and and that burden on the elderly will
shift the whole emphasis of the social welfare system
""
and i  ' ll i  ' ll i will say it  ' s something that we should really
consider seriously consider    uh  not just the mpf which is
definitely not enough for the future
""
and we have to  either revise the whole cssa system
""
we have to rethink about the old person persions the old person
pension scheme which we discussed several years ago uh which rely on uhm uh a
 payers  one-word  system where where the money is
collected in  s  the same  core  the the younger uh generation
and pay to the elderly   population  the same time
""
any other methods i don't think work really in the future
 
""
 get out of it  
""
 uhm  
""
