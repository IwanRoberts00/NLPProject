now in the previous lectures alright now we have study that we can use an one-word system to measure a different physical variables alright and there are many different types of instrument in which we can measure the different types of variables and although the variables if we try to measure might differ in forms like a we like that will be measure temperature alright flow rate or even ph value or something now we can always try to represent the  instrumentation system by means of block diagrams by means of functional blocks alright and that the cynical instrumental system may consists of the transducer the signal condition unit the transition path and the display and we call it devices now how far if you are given different types of instruments to measure different physical variable uh say for example if you try to measure temperature alright now we might have different types of measurement devices like say a resistance thermometer alright or might be a mercury if you ask thermometer and so on now so for the same types of instrument how are we going to decide which one would be better to use there will be certain criteria with image we can judge whether one instrument system is better than the other instrumental system now so in order to be able to arrive such a decision now we would need to understand what we call the performance characteristic of instruments and basically we can classify the performance characteristic into what we call the static characteristic and later on you will discuss the dynamic characteristic now if state characteristic can be used to compare the performance of different instrument under what we call a static condition that means the input do not vary with static time alright now so normally if you try to evaluate the characteristic of the instrument un under static condition  the first one that we will look at is what we call the static sensitivity now in static sensitivity can be defined as the change in output for a different unit change in input  now typically if you try to consider the one-word  curve of instrument alright suppose it is the input and suppose that is the output okay so typically if we try to evaluate the performance of instrument you will need to have a relationship between an input and output and it will given in a form of one-word curve alright now suppose this is a one-word curve okay now then if the one-word curve is a straight one like this then its sensitivity is simply given by the slope of this straight line alright and more generally if instead of having one straight line like this suppose the one- word curve is a curve like that then its sensitivity at one particular one-word would be given by the slope of the tangent to the required one-word  alright now so in this case the sensitivity would be a constant for all the input value all the input values now on the other hand if you got a one-word  curve like that then its stability would be a variable depending on the input value so typically i may said that sensitivity would be given by the rate of change of input to the rate of change of what sorry will be the rate of change of output to the rate of change of input at the required one-word  okay so we can define sensitivity in this manner and this would be a constant if the one-word curve instead of a straight line otherwise it will be a variable depending on the input value alright  a long pause  now this would be one-word curve only for a different condition now suppose there ' s a change in the surrounding temperature for example then such a one-word curve would also change alright now so suppose the one-word curve change in this manner alright the slope remains constant but then it will shift upward or downward  now so if this is the case then this is what we sometimes call the zero drift okay now this particular case the slope of the tangent curve would be a constant alright but then it will shift upward or downward depending on the change in the surrounding condition  now but a more one-word case is that besides a zero shift like that alright the slope of this line would also change alright so instead of having a curve like this then we might have a line of a different slope so in this particular case alright then there is a sensitivity drift as well as a zero drift alright so this represent a sensitivity drift okay and this represent a change in the sensitivity for a given change in condition alright so a typical instrument that have such a behaviour will be say for example a pressure pitch alright according one-word  okay it should be such a type of behaviour when the surrounding temperature shift okay therefore whenever we look at the performance characteristic the instrument then when we look at sensitivity okay we need to know its sensitivity at a given condition plus the possible change in sensitivity when the temperature okay surrounding condition changes  now you choice  now besides sensitivity that another factor that we will need to look at will be what we call reality  yes  can we almost a zero drift are the cause that even drift at continue the zero drift results when the surrounding condition changes alright uh suppose when there ' s a change in the surrounding temperature now then suppose this is your original tangent curve  let say twenty degree c alright but instead of twenty degree c your room temperature may fluctuate alright so you cannot it say that the  one-word curve could remain the same when the temperature changes say to seventeen degree c alright so suppose when the temperature changes say to seventeen degree c alright then suppose this is the resultant tangent curve alright then this we call it the zero drift alright it means even when there is no input to the instrument the output of instrument would fluctuate it will change alright now and in addition to this zero drift then its sensitivity or its slope of this one-word curve would also change as a result of say a change in the surrounding temperature okay so in reality when the surrounding condition changes then a typical change in the one-word curve say when the sun like that okay  therefore in addition of knowing the sensitivity at a different condition which also be aware how its sensitivity change when the surrounding condition changes because it ' s to be important in determining what instrument that you go to buy or or or specify alright  okay any further question a long pause  now then besides sensitivity another plot that we would need to look at would be reality  now when the instrument manufacturer tries to design an instrument it would be always desirable that the input output characteristic alright should be a linear straight line okay  because if the input output characteristic can be represented by a straight line then it would make the subsequent signal processing system much more simpler  so the instrument manufacturer would always try to aim to have this input output characteristic now but this is only the ideal case now in reality it will be difficult for people to obtain such a linear characteristic in their one- word curve  now so most probably when you test the instrument then instead of having a straight line like this then you ' ll probably have the  one-word points represented a by a curve alright  now however sometimes in the specification by the manufacturer they would always try to assume that their characteristic is that of a straight line and any deviation from a straight line they assume that it ' s an error alright because in their design they try to achieve a straight line in the output input characteristic alright so any deviation from a straight line they regard that error  now therefore reality is a measure of how the actual  one-word point deviate from a specified straight line now if this is the one-word point alright the question is how are we going to determine what is the straight line at which we draw through all these one-word points now one method could be to draw what we call the best straight line through the point alright so that is one method alright  and if we use this method then we call this to be the best fit  in reality alright okay we draw the best straight line through this one-word points by means of a statistical method alright now but sometimes in order to simply the matter then instead of drawing the best straight line through the one-word  plots people would just join the first and the last point on the  one-word curve alright so they will just draw up these two points okay alright they assume that this is the straight line that represents the characteristic of the instruments and any deviation from that to be an error alright so if we try to do this then this is what we call the terminal  in reality alright a long pause  alright can you follow this now therefore at any particular plot uh suppose uh suppose this is the actual one-word curve alright and suppose this is the straight line that we are using alright now then the error that results by assuming the straight line would be given by okay where y x is your actual result from your  one- word alright and y l x is the reading that you obtain from this straight line that you assume to be the actual  one-word curve alright and therefore this represent an error okay and then normally the error due to the reality would express the percentage of the full scale output a long pause  okay so that is how we try to represent the error due to the non-linear not due to a linear of the one-word curve alright okay and this value would represent the maximum value of this one alright so for this curve here then the maximum value would occur at above this point okay  okay yes  this represent the full scale output now so in this  one-word case now if this is the input and so if that ' s the output alright then the full scale output would be given by this value okay  alright this would be out one-word okay so when we try to express the error we often do it as a percentage of the full scale output okay that ' s how we now we ' re doing alright okay   three-words   professor three words  in the earth uh i mean the two-words  well when you try to draw this you are drawing what we call the best straight line through all these points alright so if you study mathematics you can do it by a linear by a linear equation act alright  now if you having early then we ' ll discuss later on alright now this is a this school method that would allow you to draw the best point through all these straight lines now it means a long pause  now now suppose this is the the actual one-word  plots alright okay now if this is the one-word points then you can draw several straight lines through these points now if you do not do it by statistical method now if we just do initially then the first person may draw a straight line like this okay now but the same person he may not show you he he may not share your view he might draw the straight line say in another manner and so on okay so different people can draw different straight lines through the same set of the the points so it is highly undesirable okay therefore it would need to devise a method whereby everybody use the method would come to the same conclusion for the same set of experimental points okay so the method of linear regression a long pause  now so the method that people normally use would be to draw a straight line through all these points so that the deviation of the plot from the straight line would be an a minimum okay that means we try to minimize all these distance alright  so we will discuss this method later on alright okay any question now so if we draw the straight line by this method alright then the straight line obtained is what we call the best straight line through the at that points alright a long pause  now then besides in reality that the third factor uh we would like to look at will be what we call the inability inability and it is a measure of inability of the instrument to gave the same reading under the same input condition alright now if you try to measure the output of a instrument for different input uh suppose the try to measure uh temperature at a hundred degree c alright by putting the thermometer into a one-word of boiling water  now consider this we know that the input must be a hundred degree c by definition alright  now but if you repeat the process a bit again with the same instrument under the same condition you do not necessary get the same reading any time alright uh the first time you may get a reading of hundred degree c now the second time you may get a reading of hundred and one for example alright and the third time you may get a reading of ninety nine degree and so on alright  so there would be different readings given at different time for the same input condition alright now therefore if inability is a measure of how the instrument behave under such type of condition okay so if again if we look at one-word curve like this alright now for the same input if we are able to repeat its  range a large amount of times that would actually find that the output will be distributed above the best straight line like this alright  a long pause okay  so by similar condition they can output with vary and inability is a measure of how this plot was spread above your even  one-word curve alright and so normally the inability is express in terms of standard deviation of the experimental plots
