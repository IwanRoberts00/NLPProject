  good evening this is newsline i ' m maureen boyd tonight we ' ll ask whether hong kong is doing enough for physically and mentally disabled and we ' ll take a look at some health and medical issues joining t l tsim and me tonight is the secretary for health and welfare elizabeth wong and two legislative councillors doctor leong chi hung and eric li welcome to the show all of you elizabeth wong let us start by talking about the government green paper on rehabilitation you released last month now it got a pretty rough ride in uh legislative council debate last weak uh councillors uh uh quote gave accused the government of being miserly and shortsighted your colleague do over there eric li said he was ashamed of the treatment given to the physically and mentally disable how how do you respond to them   first of all we are consulting so i welcome all shades of comments and i think there ' s nothing like public criticism that focuses the mind uhm on the other hand i think we must speak with uhm uh certain facts uh to support what we say in terms of expenditure we have come a long way from uh a hundred and twenty one million and nineteen seventy six to two point two billion  dollars last year two point five billion dollars this year so that ' s not uh uh a mean uh expansion however i do think that we may have got the po policy focal point not quite right and whole purpose of the green paper is to refocus uh to take the initiative to stand back take stock and refo focus on important issues societies change demand changes aspiration   changes   yeah     eric li what ' s your motion what what do you want the government to do   yeah  i i think it ' ll it or besides being as a time for refocusing i think it is also opportunity for us to take stock what has been done uh i i think if the government is brave to actually come out with a paper actually uh stating the shortfall     but did they get it right in the paper  i think they ' ve got a lot of it right uh there ' s still uh shortfalls obviously we don't think it ' s a perfect paper otherwise uh it do not require any consultation but does give a chance for the public to reflect their their view on the paper whether we ' ve done enough i think we are less uh perhaps uh easily satisfied uh than the perhaps the government   doctor leong   well i i don't think we should be that easily satisfied i mean you know lib libby has said that uh you know uhm uh things have changed now this is fifteen years since the last policy paper on rehabilitation i feel that really really should look in whole matter and really make things right now there ' re two areas which i think is pretty deficient in in the green paper itself firstly is that it does not take into consideration of quite a few  medical problems that we need rehabilitation take an example people chronic illness take an example people without a voice box who can't speak the other area which i think is even more important is community rehabilitation projects now when somebody is treated in hospital they get rehabilitation there but they want they will have to go out of hospital and the majority will hopefully never goes back to hospital it ' s here where rehabilitation should really take the full brunt right and i think the green paper is helping to focus on those issues but as communities become richer uh as mrs wong said they do   change aspiration and uh what we may be going through one of these phrases uh is there a lot of agreement within the profession that certain thing should be done first in other words do you have some kind of general consensus on priorities  yeah yeah yeah  i uh sorry uhm i think con general consensus is important because that will in fact allow the government to focus right and give the right priority but going back to what doctor leong has said uh he is absolutely right to say that uhm society needs have change and we need to focus and refocus on community health and what he has suggested is uh medical rehabilitation that whole chapter on medical rehabilitation and it also interfaces with primary health care with the health reform that we want to do uh throughout hong kong uh we need prioritization and in that respect i do welcome professional officers ' uhm advice on how to do it how to get it  right   yes     well you haven't made any suggestions on cash allocations for various projects your special timetables   yes  uh because this is green paper it is not a government decision it is a consultative document uhm by the time we got all the ideas in then we will have to draft the white paper which is a government statement for future direction in the white paper normally we ' ll have an implementational  programme and reasons why we implement it in certain ways so uhm uh green paper normally precedes white you know i think there are some consensus despite the fact that uh  uh what we show i think in the motion uh one part that ' s accepted by all councillors and also the the general public is that first of all we we do want it to be done quick quicker than what has been planned one of these is the message seems that we can only deal with all these things within ten years i think there ' s strong consensus that we want to do it much quicker let ' s say five years the other is the other aspect is the community support i think that uh the government uh it should be taking a a greater lead in encouraging the wider community to support both financially in in terms of attitude change and three-words      eric lee is it your view that we need more money to do that i mean now less than half of one percent of uh hong kong ' s uh gdp is spent on social welfare  that ' s not uh nearly enough i can quote figures uh for example uh i ' ve act actually calculated  if we use general public expenditure we ' re spending something like twenty thousand dollar per person  the fact that the rehabilitation service is is quite isolated from all the rest of the main stream services i mean that for example transport uh disabled person cannot enjoy the normal person ' s uh transport fac facilities they ' re they ' re all completely isolated and we take that two billion and divided by what the government said there ' s twenty two hundred and seventy thousand people but the figure i ' ve showed is about seven thousand dollars five hundred dollar   uh i i think here there may be some  misunders understanding in that uh in terms of the cash spending we know exactly what the government is spending but there are so many areas of uh spending which are not identified as public expenditure for instance the transport uh facility the subsidies that go on uh in in hong kong elsewhere and uhm when we talk about moving faster greater progress i think we are we are we have the common goal of trying to achieve within  shorter space of time to do the right thing even uh do it overnight   but what about the short shortfall of eight hundred and ten  bands for the severely mentally handicapped   actually once that ' s right  but once identified the shortfall then i think the uhm uh solution will be there because even as recently as last month we ' ve got a uh an overall plan as to how to overcome the current shortfall of eight hundred but if we were to relate to the perpetual short  one-word uhm you know there ' s no such things as meeting full demand in any society cause we we demand catches up the better you do it the better people want it and therefore you ' re forever catching up with the demand it is call the theory of perpetual motion but having said that i think both the uhm uh colleagues in the branch and also people who are on the committees of rehab rehabilitation they want to get sort it out the whole thing sort it out meet the shortfall within five years now it means a joint effort between not only the government but the community at large but therefore if the government doesn't do it uh then shame on the government if the community doesn't do it then shame on the  community   uhm one-word     okay there ' s two hundred seventy thousand disabled people in the territory with some forty two percent being uhm mentally handicapped uh certainly much smaller groups have their own functional constituencies seat in legislative council do you hold out much hope that this group will get their own legco seat  certainly this is a point of view very much supported by members of my working party and uh we we can also learn from experience elsewhere in the united states in uk in japan they have a national focal point and i think it will be uhm uh very good if we could have some sort of representation uhm a kind of advocate if you like uhm but mind mind you i think uh in this area i it it ' s really an area where i defer my friend ' s comment     okay doctor leong let ' s   i i i ' m uhm uh i agree with uh libby  that you know some form of representation is definitely needed but i like to bring bring out two points one point is that now who will be the represent representative in other words will it be a person from the disabled group or would be a person who working for disabled group and that ' s first point the second point is that who will be the voters will it be the disabled people who will voting or will just the people working for the disabled will be voting i i think that ' s important   i am com  i ' m completely opposed to functional constituencies  uh i i really think we should go for direct election   well basically   i i agree with you t l uh   and have a house of lords for all the professionals like doctors and lawyers and accountants   you you know that that ' s that ' s interesting i mean i i represent a functional constit but i would agree with you entirely that functional constituen is not exactly the best way out but having had to have functional constituen for the next i don't know how many years     eric li ' s trying to   i ' m stand to be corrected i stand  to be corrected but if you look at all the the uh the policies of the various of people who come come up for direct election uh the rehabilitation uh disabled body doesn't feature very much at all in the their work and also their on their platform so far and uh i stand to be corrected but   that ' s right   there ' s certainly a lot of social workers  a lot of teachers and social workers   they have but what have they done so far uh i ' m appointed member it ' s up to me to raise this uh the geographical spread of disabled person they all spread out  you know various uh places they ' re less than five percent of the total population they belong to minori minority group at this stage and age people like them will be ignored if they are not protected and given a a uh champion  are all they    well something pointed out in green paper was the lack of the legislative measures to protect the dis the rights of the disabled elizabeth wong are you going to pushing for more legislation   i mean right now you the advocate   uh i think uh  well yes i think there are certain areas of legislation that needs to be uh reformed uhm because we ' ve got the for example uh mental health ordinance  one-word and there is a move uhm uh there are calls that the mental health uh ordinance doesn't cover or shouldn't cover all sorts of mental handicap it should be divided into a separate ordinance but there are pros and cons each way but i think it be wrong to use the law to ask for uh services because services would have to be provided whether or not there is a law and the law is not an instrument for pushing for services but law it would be an instrument in my opinion for justifying uh and uh looking after the the areas uhm where individual themselves may not be able to look after themselves so it is a question of guardianship law that we need to be reexamining and the green paper has gone into great detail and we feel that this area which needs to be addressed by the law commission   well in other areas uh you have rejected tax concessions uh and other meths methods of encouraging employment for the disabled  why  i think tax concession in a hong kong uhm philosophy is probably a bit complicated because hong kong law is very tax law is very simple kong hong kong tax is on a base on the four schedule system and that we ' ve got a very low tax structure uh to complicate it with in in an exemption would is going to be neither here nor there and indeed it can be equally argued uh that uhm to provide an exemption to en encourage employers to employ disable  people is a form of discrimination in fact you are trying to you know force uh through the law a discriminatory structure the very thing we ' re going to toss out  because hong kong     what about localization in the in the civil service   yes  in civil service we we en we are quite uhm uh good i think by comparison we have two per two percent of our civil servants are in one way or another handicapped and uhm and the we are the best employers of handicap  people in hong kong  we hope we can we hope we can promote other organization do the same     eric lee   yes   i think we we recognize that although we ' re talking about ideals uh there ' re need to be some incentive to to get things to to start moving particularly the private sector we have to talk about incentive we cannot uh simply uh force people to do things in hong kong uh on on the tax law i i suddenly see the resistance and the reason why being an accountant myself but uh we are not short of having legislation who are whi  which has a social implication like the the the tobacco tax and also the also the tax on the stamp duty of the the buying and selling of flats i think it depends on how strongly the community feel that should be done and need not be a permanent feature   okay let ' s take a break here and when we come back we ' ll uh take a look at some more health issues stay with us
