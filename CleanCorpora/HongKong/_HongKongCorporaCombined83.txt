  okay how ' s your teaching practice   laughs  uhm   have you finished  no i had i have more uh two more week   oh only two more weeks  yes   so you finish it in uhm may second week of may  yes   uhm     oh okay what are you going to do in the next two weeks  you mean the english teaching   yeah  uh i think uh   laughs    yeah go on   uhm  i will give more i will give more uh paperwork and  group work to them because they can ha they start they start to understand my instruction but uh i ' m also uh uhm have to use chinese uhm uhm     uh ha   i think it ' s normal in primary one to use some chinese yes but uh what ' s what ' s the discipline like   yes uhm  uh they ' re crazy   laughs  they always put up your hand uh one-word put up their hands and ask question in chinese   uh ha it ' s okay  i think you have to realize that they just basically they just left their mother or their maid   uhm  uhm uhm   uh it was their full time care before and they come to the p one class and so the teacher become like the mother or the maid    and the you you can't really teach them like you can all the children for just care for them look after them make sure they okay go to the toilet you know what they want and everything like that  so it ' s much it ' s quite different role for for teaching in in a senior school right in secondary   uhm   uhm  i think the regular teacher uhm is not very strict  uhm they and he allowed them to talk in chinese or uh leave their things and come out to ask me the question in front of me    strict  oh oh i see  how how many children in a class   uhm  thirty five   oh okay  well i think un unless they i mean you can't expect them to to speak in english in those lesson actually  except when you actually getting them to practice something or to  to repeat something after you you know to do some reading aloud there ' s a time they ' re going to be talking in chinese  talking luckily  but uh i i don't think you should you should stop them doing that you should try to give them more uh activities which would make them use english  but you can't forbid them from speaking chinese  even worse   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   yes  uhm so every time i uh want to stop their bad behaviour and  i use chinese because if i uh use english they will not uhm   they won't take it serious   yes  they will not uh how to say it i think they can't understand or they will not uhm care my uhm strategy is it   laughs    well i think what a a good strategy is is you need discipline and keep them under control then you use should chinese but then you could follow up with some english so they they learn the vocabulary and the you know the phrases associated with classroom discipline  uhm and one more thing they can remember the vocabulary very well but they can't remember the sentence structure  so uh every time i give them some flash card they can shout the  vocab correctly    uh ha  uh ha  uhm uhm and last time cecilia chu uh observed my class uhm they al  they were noisy and cecilia chu cannot uh hear my wrong pronunciation  oh     i see you ' re very lucky all speakers laugh  uh i i think that uh pro children of uh that age are not ready to understand the structure of the language so teaching them may be teaching them vocabulary teaching them some songs or poems something interesting and and  enjoyable will build up their their language knowledge and they ' re not  once once their once their mind their brain mature and they get the cognitive ability to understand abstract thing then they can understand how all these words and they put it together into a language   but this stage they ' re just not ready   yes   uhm uhm uhm i ' m agree   uhm  uhm the last chapter is about the colour so i give them the song about colour and they also uh uh  crazy and shout but uhm     teach them to sing the song  yes i give them the uh listen the song one time and  they follow the rhyme and they sing it but it ' s very noisy    uh ha  i think it ' s not a problem if you got a noisy p one class  unless they unless they completely out of control   if you ' ve got them under control but and they ' re noisy well that ' s  natural   uhm   uhm   because my tutor is very tut want to  uhm control want me to control the discipline very well so i g thus bear in mind that i use the star to give each group  but uhm other tutor especially the foreigner uh they  one-word uhm they appreciate to uh the uhm to join the student to sing the song together uhm uhm    uhm   uhm  think as a different philosophy because it uh in chinese culture the schooling as is the something very formal and uh children like better to behave behave in a very formal manner the teacher very one-word discipline or authorial figure but in the western idea that you know especially junior secondary schooling more about enjoy matter having fun  making school uh something which the children could enjoy so that later on they can begin to learn something valuable for them so they just different way of looking at   uhm   uhm  uhm   uhm  but uh the publisher of my textbook is longman  newelcome newelcome  uh the resources is uhm very useful because i have  the material uh about the chapter i have to teach  yes and i i ' ve got a lot of work card and the fresh card even the wall picture so i i use this often     uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   so two-words uhm   uhm uhm  uhm good  just just the regular teachers use  these as well   uhm   uh  no i it ' s very new so i think i ' m the first one to open the box   i see one-word  i got as well when i was in primary school last year i i found all these materials in the in a store room i thought oh great i ' ll use them   laughs  they ' ve never been used before yeah it ' s strange  teachers normal teach the one-word of book and teach from the book i think so what do you plan to do uh say i ' ll see your teaching practice and you come back here may be you get a job in a primary school    or is that what you plan to do to get a job in a primary school straight away  straight away   laughs  or do you want to continue your study   yeah   uhm   uhm yeah   uhm   yes of course   uhm  i think i will prefer to teach in a primary school  first     uh  but you know that the government now expects some  teacher to be graduate university graduate  so what do you go to do about that   yeah uhm uhm uhm uhm  may be i will take the the part time part the part time bachelor course  but it ' s it taken four years to be yeah but if i uh yeah  if i choose to study the full time p ed   it takes only two years    uhm uhm   one-word take four year   yeah  we we are planning a new course which will be like the two year uh full time but it you could take it over three years  that means you you study uh in the evening you study two evenings a week uh during the term time plus saturday afternoon during term time and then you come back for four weeks in the summer   four or five weeks in the summer so in that way you can complete the the degree in three years instead of four  do you think it ' s a good idea   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uh  yes   uhm good so we have to offer it in september so you can apply for it   oh i want to get the degree soon   uhm i think it ' s in a way  well it ' s necessary otherwise you just be because this is to be inferior  and you won't get a graduated post  uh many of the teachers in a school university graduates   uhm uhm   uhm  i don't know   wow   laughs uhm  but uhm i think their english is not very well and it ' s not good enough to teach the primary five or primary six     uhm  really the regular teachers uhm  have you heard them speaking english   yes   uhm  uhm seldomly but i uhm heard one time before uh i can uh catch uh mistake uhm uhm    uhm  but but properly uhm when you ' re teaching when they are teaching in a classroom they must more conscious of the  accuracy of what they say  and so they you know they and also they ' re just teaching  uhm   uhm  uhm uh may be the traditional teacher uhm always want to want their student uh sit uh on the in the seat uh quietly but uhm without the i think without the conversation between the students     uhm uhm  uhm uhm but i think it ' s uhm uh there is a one advantage because uhm the teacher can teach the  they have to teach the vocab or the grammar smoothly   yeah i i think the also you have to think about the size of the class because when you when we talk about a different philosophy of teaching or in the west for example we ' re only talking about classes of less than twenty usually uhm uhm   and uhm not only that but the regular teachers would have some helpers  parents uh in in the english primary school or american primary school it parents very often come in to help teachers to class  of the children and especially in the lower form classes so you may have half i mean half students one-word you know how when you got one thir thirty five like  to about one to ten one-word  so it ' s a bit a bit difference and then you could allow the children to to walk around to have a freedom to to express themselves uh play with thing in the class under the teacher ' s supervision but it will be very difficult for two-word  that was a class of thirty five kids uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm  and last year i went to the england and i had a chance i had a chance to visit the primary school and yes their learning environment is very good because they can talk with other and the teacher will allow them to uh do anything they want uhm but it ' s yes the i think the percentage between the student and the teacher is very low    uh uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  yeah it ' s not really that the teacher was allowed to do anything they want there are rules in that kind of situation but the the classroom is decided to provide learning experiences for the children   so you have you know you have different corner of a classroom computer over there uh a class library over here some kind of game here but they are educational games so when the children have the freedom to walk around there ' s there ' s all there ' s something for them to do which is  educational in nature  and the well i think the i mean the chinese system is very successful when it works well so it ' s brilliant system so there are uh uh there are advantages and disadvantages to both system   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm uhm   i suppose the chinese one-word in hong kong is more economical   laughs  could you got larger class with fewer teachers and so it it takes less money to educate children   uhm but  yeah that is better because when i ' m in pri primary school i my cla there or there are may be forty one or two in my class  but now it ' s reduced to thirty something   yes it ' s better but uhm the classes uh i think the communication between the teacher and the student is tut not enough    uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm   uhm  but in fact it ' s the language class yeah i agree   uhm uhm   because we can't wait we talk about how we communicative approach  but actually it it ' should really uh very out fashioned approach which we ' re using in hong kong what was the structure approach to teaching structures   uhm   uhm uhm  uhm   uhm  are you prefer uh being strict or strict or loose  in the class   well i think uh personally well i should i ' ve never taught primary one or primary  two kids and the lowest level i taught was primary three and uhm and so i i think it ' s one-word to be different between those two different level   uhm  in a government primary school or the  international school    one-word in in uhm  no this was in a school in uh tai po and uhm one of in uhm in the uh it takes i can't remember the name but it was a catholic school   uh  uhm   and so it was quite uh strict i mean the children that one that were uh obviously had been told to have to behave in the class they were very polite they didn't jump up just there were few one-word quite excitable but they were generally well behaved uh   uhm uhm  are they very uh high ability   uhm i think that they just average or may be a little bit above average but it was it was higher ability uh there were some in there who were very weak and there were some uh who can who actually who actually converse with you know you can talk to about their family and you have a conversation with them   uh   uhm uhm uhm  uhm   but uhm the speech range and it was it ' s of course it ' s much easier to uh to teach them in a large group of about thirty five if they if they are disciplined well behaved so you have to be a little bit strict to in order to  to maintain that   uhm  also because when i give them chance to speak in class uhm very noisy and when the other teachers uh may be pass out pass to my classroom outside my classroom they will lock the door  yes and i think it ' s very embarrass  no it ' s uh i think they want to make sure uh the student are  clam can take clam down and they can may be they care about my teaching they uhm i think may be they think i cannot manage the   discipline  they want to help me    oh really   one-word   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm okay  so they help two-words  uhm uhm  but it make it make it makes me embarrass    yeah  yeah put pressure uh right right   laughs uhm what about uhm do you know thing about teaching in taiwan taiwan oh   because uhm i ' ve heard people making comparison between hong kong and taiwan think that taiwan who must not creative   i think it may be  creative    uhm   oh i i ' m   the student are much creativity instead of   one-word in in a primary school   uh ha ha  uhm i think uh the taiwan teach uh may be the system is  similar to china system  yeah   uhm uhm but mainland china  oh really  oh i i don't know i ' m just make a guess     alright i don't know  uhm well i uh i think it ' ll be interesting to find out more about taiwan  uhm   so we we have some teachers from guangdong province here last year  and the they have uh very very large classes  they think the class of sixty is already small small class sometimes they teach ninety children one class   uhm uhm   uh  how can a teacher can take care other  children uh     two-words  i have no idea but uh you know they then somehow it ' s interesting to find out  no i ' m teaching five class and i still can't remember all the student ' s name so if   laughs one class and there there are more than fifty people pupils in one class i think i can't manage   uhm  uhm uhm so i would not give them the homework to do because i don't want to correct the   what about the native english teacher in your school does she teach uh does she have her own two-words   yes two-words    does she have her own uh classes   uhm     or does she just teach  just teach english     or  oral lesson  no or uh the whole uhm the i think uhm teach one class english it will yeah     okay does she give all the lessons then one class some classes   uhm uhm  uh i once time uhm may be last month last month i uh standing outside i was standing outside uh of her classroom and i  thought her how to teach the tense  the past perfect and the past tense and  i saw the blackboard he use the blackboard fluently and just write it down all the past tense and i think he taught the how to the the change uhm from  play to played  she want to the student to remember the uh spelling and the how to change the format of words    uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh ha  so you think she was a good teacher  no   oh the thing is the uh oh what i don't understand what you ' re saying then  he ' s so quiet  all the class is quiet  one-word     oh i see   oh okay so it ' s very traditional manner uhm   yeah they just write the the table   about the past tense and past perfect tense on the in the pa  on paper and haven't taught uhm  but just once time i don't know the other lesson    uhm   uhm uhm   one-word   yeah  yeah may be it just for those few minutes when you  have looking yeah   laughs uhm okay   uhm uhm   but i think the students are afraid of her    because uh two-words is uhm teacher is teaching the uh her class now and uh the students uh  always meet her uh loo look for her to talk with two-words  but in english   laughs     uh really   uhm uhm uhm uhm  so they don't want to see the other the net teacher uhm is she australian   uhm uhm  i don't know may be the british     uhm may be  uhm okay uhm  then we should make  okay one year   that ' s the college  college college environment yeah   yes the college some one-word  yeah  and i can meet a lot of other countries ' student uhm they also uh learn uh they also uh participate the english programme uh one-word yes it ' s true because i uh stay in england two month and uhm in this two months i can talk with the foreign spea uh foreigners and i also i thinking and i dreaming i use the english   uh really that ' s good   yeah  but now uh since i uh come back to hong kong after may be one week and i just forgot all the may be one-word the  because i have not i talk in english everyday   and uh i stay my host uh my host mother and host father always talk with me uhm uhm so i can manage their accents and uh also i uhm use to one- word their culture in england they they don't like the chinese traditional habit uh they told me that  i cook the chinese food for them    what kind of job   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm good   uh  oh may be they don't like your cook  no all speakers laugh  may uh because uh uhm before i stay uh in their home  uh may be each the with they try it very uh curiously  but uh they don't want to try it again     uhm   uh   uh ha   uh  what what did you cook  uh the dessert uh how to say  one-word at uh and i take them round the flour and    oh  what what ' s the name in chinese   one-word    uh oh oh nothing i can't assume home a lot  no it ' s a kind of uh   dessert  dessert we similar     oh yeah i know yeah  dessert yeah
