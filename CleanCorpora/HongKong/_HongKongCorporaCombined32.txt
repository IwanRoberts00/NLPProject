so i offer you a glass of water first alright     thank you  i think we can have our breakfast in about fifteen minutes   that ' s fine  doris should be back well let me just explain to you what what uhm well first i have to thank you for coming  my friend who works in the university he wants me to do this  uhm cos they they have a project and it ' s all about uhm asian chinese talking in english so what he wants to get now is a hong kong chinese person so maybe later on he want a malaysian chinese person then laugh i certainly will recommend you and i think what he had did what he has done previously uh was recording certain things uhm certain conversation of other nationality which i did not ask for details so there ' s a list i have to fill up and uhm it ' s uhm let me just show you this it ' s tape recording conversations okay  so i have certain restrictions for doing that so i can't do it with uhm mamy    alright  i can't make it up with uhm a person to whom i seldom speak english   right  so i have to make it a natural conversation and the person that i have to uh speak english to so i can think of you at present because you are closer by   yes  a couple of my friends i mean they are eurasian for example i mention that but because we speak half chinese half english so the conversation for this may not be so good  so i don't think you ' re interested in that so but if you do have a look   okay  yeah   so what one-word   so i just wanted to be   what what is the purpose of this whole project who is it for  uhm he mentioned that it ' s mainly for research  it ' s a research base so people who are studying linguistics   will will use it and uhm i don't know i don't know what type of student but  not aiming apparently not aiming for hong kong    uh uh   right  right  uhm they i ask him the question of linguistics and i said you know to me is  like that i really don't don't know a lot   yeah  uhm and to me after his explanation i am still blank   what just just uh off the subject of this thing i just want to ask you about computers and children  computers and children     yeah  what do you think of kids of your your children ' s age like jonathan is now four are you do you think it is wise for them to start learning computer or playing computer games or anything related to educational computers what do you think about it  uhm for me i think that kids before six shouldn't  concentrate too much or use using their eye muscles too much that ' s only my personal judgment  and the reason i said that is because i spoke to a few friends some of them are teachers some of them are uhm principals of the school and what they said is children before certain age actually at different stages they utilize or or they are powerful in certain type of muscles so if you force the kid to use the pen too early then later on uh it affects for example their brain certain part of their brain muscle or their eye muscle   or their uh hand muscle and so therefore you remember previously i mentioned about not sending jacqueline to kindergarten right     uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   right  and because they said kids before three that is between one and a half to about roughly three years old their developmental stages are mainly on their uh hearing and their  speaking  so if you emphasize the kids or if you encourage the kids to develop more on these parts it helps their future  development and now i can see the result do you remember i stop working a year ago     uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah uhm uhm  and jonathan was staying with my maid previously so before three years old he seldom talk   oh right three words   for there are two two reasons first i am not around uh at home secondly my maid who ' s who used to spend the time with him that one is completely quiet  he doesn't talk much so i can see that jonathan does not use his mouth in communicating with people a lot  he doesn't speak so all he wants to do is just uhm you know like that    oh   uhm  yeah  and i stop working last year so jon jacqueline was about one and a half to one and three quarter  maybe i am wrong so i try to communicate with her  just you know asking questions when when she say something i ' ll try to explain it was not uh purposely doing that but what i want to do is i want to stimulate her interest so naturally i talk a lot  and now she is at school for about a week  all the teachers at school are astonished by her   cos she speaks too much speaks too much not is is not that she just  multiple words like the like a parrot  she speak a whole sentence and she can explain herself pretty clearly  and so right from the school bus driver to the teacher to her class uhm uhm teacher and also the principal everyone said oh jacqueline is famous already at school cos everyone like to hold her because  she keeps on talking to you a lot laugh  i said uh oh i don't know whether it ' s a compliment or it ' s a criticism but laugh     oh yeah   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm uhm  is she enjoying school at the moment  she start she start to like   uhm uhm  so so if you ask about computer uhm i i would think if kids well after the three between four and six uh i think it ' s the eye muscle   uhm  so you you probably have noticed that hong kong children or hong kong persons are very short-sighted did you notice that and most of them wear glasses     five words i ' ve think about it yeah  right   it ' s true  compare to all overseas even o other parts of uhm asia  i think if if you go around you will find eighty percent of them wearing glasses    uhm  i think it ' s uhm multiple words  and the the reason that they said is uh if you emphasize the kid too much with their eye muscle at a much earlier stage it would deteriorate their eyes ' uhm development so  again i don't know whether that ' s true but i think they must have some psycholog uh i mean some proving to that and if you develop the kids like if you force the kid to write too early then naturally their eyes have to focus too early and that would form their short-sighted    one-word form  so computer i don't know some people mention about reflection    uhm  that ' s true  using the eye muscles too much  uhm one of my friends one of my friends send her daughter to this computer class she is about jonathan ' s age  probably she hasn't got short-sighted yet at present but i can see that her eyes are a bit more closer together    uhm  how old is she  she is only four of of of course she likes it i mean this little girl likes the the computer program uh but i think again is the exposure the exposure to that cos she just think it ' s a toy she will just start playing    uhm  yeah  but i was just thinking on the basis of computer is there ' s a lot of computer games which are not related to just play but  educational uhm programs where they encourage the kid to think and challenge the computer relating to development as they progress at school like alphabet games or acknowledging certain words or certain diagrams is that they having you having to buy books and you having to draw things or get them to do it that ' s what i was trying to see multiple words  age or is it   uhm laugh  sorry laugh  i think you really want your kids to be super kids   no i think i i am just plain lazy uh sort of trying to think what i should do with uh get a computer and let them challenge it   did i mention to you about a seminar   no  a super a super kid seminar  one-word the this let me think of the  one-word title of it i think the title is how to bring the best of your children   uhm  it started last august cough  excuse me last july to last august and the speaker is a malaysian chinese   oh really  yeah he studied actually i think in malaysia and then he furthered his studies in the states so he attended a lot of different types of seminars things like that uhm and he said what interests him to do this kind of program or seminar was a a subject or objective mainly on children is because he ' s got a young daughter i think must be his first child and he said a lot of things that the kid is doing or progressing depends very much on how the adults guide the kid and he can't just bring out a perfect kid uh because every kid has different personality so he probably has planned much further ahead so what he did is uh when his wife was pregnant he started you know reading a lot of things etcetera and eventually he quitted his job and he just wanted to specialize in children ' s education and so he further his studies in the states uh so he came back to malaysia singapore i don't whether where is his base probably between malaysia and singapore and uhm because he is us sort of educated so can he bring back a lot of more open uhm idea things to the country and he started this program uhm the first time he offered this is must be let me think must be in july when i attended and he cut short the program from two days to one day because he was told by the organizer in hong kong that uh you can't get so many attendance on the weekend so you better just squeeze everything in one day  cos hong kong people are really pushy so  uh he started that program on a saturday and i attended it ' s a full day seminar from eight thirty to about six and after that the attend attendees like us still think that it ' s probably good to be a two days ' program because too many questions too many things are doing at one day and what he mentioned about bringing the best of your children is that at different stages he emphasized that as well at different stages kids are developing different types  of their muscles their cells so you have to aim at the right thing so that the kid will be brought up properly  so he mentioned about the left brain the right brain did i mention that to you    uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   two words  no  okay and he said sometimes if you find a kid who is particularly rebellious everything you ask he is doing opposite to you and you always think that why is he not a good kid you know so most parents define kid kids as good kid or naughty kids right and he said these are not good terms if you try to bring up  bring up your kids in a in a positive attitude you have to relate to the facts uhm the uh the incidents so naughty means what is it because he has spilled the juice because he has uh he hasn't done what you want him to do so bring mention to him about what he has done wrong but don't use the word you are naughty boy  and laugh you know what after a lot of you know those sort of things that he mention which is very very common i would say about ninety-five percent ninety percent of the parents would do that everything he mentioned is a very common reaction from the parent but it has certain uhm what ' s the right word to use it has certain facts in the way he described it and he tried to correct it so that we can exercise that on the kid and you will see the effect the next day  so i remember he said about naughty  he said if you mention naughty to your boy and use with your finger pointing at him you naughty boy  you see he said there ' re two uhm disadvantages one is is a psychological one cos with the finger pointing at the kid you are much taller the kid is much shorter and that ' s a very strong  authoritarian on him  so he can't all he feels is the pressure on him like just because you ' re bigger and stronger than i do then then you ' re more forceful it doesn't mean that you are uh as equal as them so he taught us one way when you want to teach your your child bend your knees down be at the same level laugh so at least he will feel some equalism and then don't use your figure to point at him so instead you just sort of be be comfortable with him and tell him what ' s wrong if he has spilled the juice don't just say you naughty boy you have to say look what have you done you spilled the juice and this is not a nice behaviour so tell him that because of what his action and it has caused you discomfort or you dislike what he has done so he will recognize the fact rather than it ' s me again mommy you always pick on me and what have i done you know sort of in his mind is what have i done you always call me naughty boy  and he said the other thing is that you will find it the kid pick it up what you said very quickly if you say he ' s a naughty boy today tomorrow he will tell you back he won't tell the mommy back he will tell whoever sibling he has if it ' s younger than him then he will say you naughty girl or any other younger kid than he he will say you naughty boy    uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm  oh they ' ll repeat after you of course
