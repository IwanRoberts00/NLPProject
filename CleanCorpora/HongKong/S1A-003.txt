yeah great 
 
 not not not very much 
not very much
 
uhm no i think so 
uhm how about your mother
 
computer programmer 
oh always associated with programmer computing my god
 
well you have to know nowadays 
how about your sister
 
my sister she ' s fifteen 
 high school
 
yah in high school yah 
high school but you will enter into university
 
she will yeah 
she will
 
yup uh she is not sure what she wants to do
she ' s thinking of astrometry 
huh huh
 
uhm or uh what else what she ' s thinking about i can't remember
is either that or something else yeah but she ' s got a long way
to go
she ' s got three or four years two years before she
enters the university
two years two three 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm uhm is it most of your friends in australia are also
chinese or singapore 
 
 most of them are chinese but australian-born or
australian-raised 
uh huh
 
yes i think 
australian-born chinese
 
yeah or australian-raised
some of them are born here but moved to australia at a very young
age 
uhm uhm
 
uhm 
is there any racial discrimination in australia
 
not very much 
not very much
you didn't met any
 
uhm not really
it ' s you you know england uhm it ' s
a lot better than england 
 but some of my s 
 yeah 
better than england
 
like there ' s less racial discrimination in australian than in
england
england is quite a bit 
oh but but one of my friend has emigrated to australian
 
uhm 
and she said complained in her letter she had beaten by a
white girl because she is chinese
 she has 
 
 where does she live 
sydney
 
sydney strange
i don't know 
you don't know
 
uhm where 
 you you didn't met any because you are lucky
 
no it ' s rare in sydney
uhm because sydney in particular is very multicultural 
and so i mean there is racial discrimination
there are the usual people uhm but uhm for instance government ' s
attitudes and in general is not much racial
discrimination
may be individuals 
 uh huh 
 uhm uhm 
individuals case only 
 
 yeah yeah that ' s i think that ' s right 
i see
 
sydney individuals don't like so many asian people in australia
uh huh uh huh uh huh 
 
 uhm and some you know sometimes they get together
in groups and something but the overall certainly the government stand is
that uhm it ' s a multicultural country
it always like that 
may be she is newly arrived in australia and her 
well there is some bad communication between them so
 
 uh 
yeah 
 t exist the racial communi 
discrimination
 
 uhm 
what is your salary here
 
seven thousand one month 
huh so so many so much
 
generous boss 
seven thousand
 
generous boss 
where is she
where is she 
 
 uhm she is on holiday
she left last night
she ' s going back to australia 
so early
 
uhm she ' s going for a until january 
 who is she this one
 
yeah that is kate one-word my employer 
 ngoh an-exclamation oh she has 
thre three students ngh haih no no children
 
yup 
oh that is husband
 
yeah uhm 
uhm uhm dìm so now what 
 
uhm tut for all we are talking about this the job here
 the job is an the job is boring uh like
you said before but 
 uhm uhm 
 data entry is very boring
 
yeah but i mean you get used it after a while uh in the sense
that uh you you you spend your time talking to some other
people and all sort of thing and that ' s make more interesting
 
 your peg your peg peggy 
 act as an receptionist
 
what 
will you answer telephone and
 
no no because my cantonese is probably not good
enough and uh i don't really know what goes on about here but later on when a
lot of people leave i probably will have to answer telephones cos there are
only two or three people here 
 no 
huh huh
 
and sometimes you know there ' s five people on the phone all at
once because so many people were so 
 okay 
 
yeah 
could we talk about your school life in australia
 
school that was a few years ago uhm school or
university 
 school 
any you like
 
okay so university is more current
uhm i ' m i ' m doing in the middle of economics degree 
yeah
 
uh which is pretty much the same as the commerce degree in 
 that uni 
 uh you further study after you graduated
 
well i further study no but i ' m doing honours so i ' m planning
to enter honours in economics for fourth year
 so that means i ' m doing a extending degree of
four years not three years
uhm the commerce and economics is only about twelve or thirteen
hours a week of actual lectures and tu tutorials
 uhm so i can usually get a couple days off 
 uh huh 
 uh huh 
 uhm uhm 
 uh huh 
aw a couple of days
 
yeah or or one at least out of two of last time last section last
semester
uhm the the the australian semester are there two they go from
march to june and 
march to june uh huh
 
august about august to about the one-word of
november i should say end of november 
uh huh
 
yeah so there are the two semesters
uh is different from hong kong 
yeah of course
 
 yeah 
 august is my summer vacation
 
right 
you know
 
yeah three months i think uh huh 
 yes 
will you find any summer job in your uhm holidays in australia
 
no very difficult very difficult 
 difficult 
 why 
 
 very difficult
you have to uhm there ' s a link uh not many place offers summer
jobs but some do uh big department stores uh 
big depa department store 
 
 yeah yeah they will offer and so you go and sign
there
but you have to sign for a summer job in december you have to
start signing up at around july 
 ho an-exclamation 
 
and that ' s usually have been book where everybody puts their
name in
they may want one out of a thousand
yeah so it ' s really difficult to find a summer job
and it ' s even more difficult to find a job in a company 
<$a
huh huh
 
uhm relevant to your career in which you have to apply usually
through the university
they ' ll look your marks and you might get any interview
and once you have an interview your chance is much improved this
one in fifty or something like that 
aw i see 
 
 but uh to get an interview is quite difficult as
well 
do you worry about your future then
 
yeah yeah sometimes uhm 
 sometimes 
 
well a lot 
 what do you want to become
 
uhm i don't really know because i ' m trying the market to yet
i ' m doing finance and economics that ' s a quite a broad field
 in the sense i can probably start working or going to
finance company anything like that 
 uh huh 
 bank 
 
oh bank yes i ' m looking at a bank right now may be macquarie
bank you know a merchant bank
uhm because i ' ve done economics of all that yeah that ' s why i
should look at a bank economics and finance that ' s uh tends
to be accommodation for a bank
 alternatively i can go to a regular company and
advise them and have to make you know have to bid company
uhm for me to do that and hold in mind end ending up
like that say advising uhm the directors or whatever 
 uh huh 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 advice them 
some people say the une unemployment rate is very high in
australia
 
uhm it ' s about as i know 
 is that been the case
 
nine point seven or six per cent i think
it ' s been dropping
yeah we had after the recession we had a recession 
from eighty-nine nineteen eighty-nine to nineteen well that ' s
like that ' s 
 recession 
 uh because you are studying in economics so you
 knew know all that well
 
 yeah i should i should know uhm well i mean
 
 professional knowledge
 
officially i think the recession ended in ninety-one or
ninety-two but really it kept dragging on today it isn't a recovery say going
to four per cent until around ninety-three and then we start getting growth
at four per cent and that the emplo unemployment rate is taking a
long time to drop
 it reached about eleven or ten point nine or
something and it ' s finally dropped below ten just recently and
 it ' s probably around nine point six and it ' s still dropping so that ' s
good good news 
 uh huh 
 uhm uhm 
aw so you see the trend is uh better and better
 
the problem with that we are getting at economics you see
the the problem with that is that uhm australia has a very big
trade deficit with the rest of the world 
huh huh
 
uhm i think that 
why
 
because uhm australia has generally borrowed more than it its it
has borrowed more than it has lent and uh or in terms of
imports and exports australia imports a lot 
yeah australia imports a lot of materials and exports very little so
the only exports are really things like raw materials commodities wheat wool
 things like that
uhm tut and it imports a lot of things cars and clothes
shoes all that sorts of thing
and uhm certainly we got uh a big deficit trade deficit 
with the rest of the world
and that has made our foreign debt about one hundred and
forty-eight billion dollars i think uhm which is about well a while ago it
was about forty-four per cent of our gdp uhm so to get
rid of all our foreign debt uhm we have to pay off the half of our annual
products
yeah which it is yeah enormous amount
and uh the annual problem the problem with that it keeps going
and as our economy recovers we import more 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 more than more than it 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
 
and so it gets even worse 
vicious circle
 
yeah that ' s right vicious circle
you know enough economics 
then you can talk about finance
 
uhm i ' m not so good though 
you are major in economics
 
and finance yes 
and finance also
 
yes 
double you mean double major 
 
 yes double major that ' s right 
oh i see
 double major
 
 yeah 
and uhm also do minor in economics which is statistics 
and uh 
 statistics computing 
 
no not computing 
 computing 
no
 
or some computing but very much
uhm mainly statistical programme 
 but you should have some computing 
knowledge 
 
 yes i should
i do
i do 
you do
 
yeah more than most of the people here for instance 
uhm uhm
 
uhm they don't have any computer knowledge but my computer
knowledge not very high compared to most other people i know
most of my friend in fact have better computer knowledge than me
 anyone doing one year or two years of compu
 of any engineering like whatever will have better
computer knowledge than me 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 of course 
 
yeah like i just know a bit of my mom and dad 
uhm uhm
 
so i can 
you can uh learn from them
 
yeah like i can what kind of computer i know what to do i mean to
look up stuff
and to limited extend i can change the structure of 
one-word of the computer like the memory and uh
that sort f thing 
 uh huh 
do you kno do you know some knowledge about programming
 
not really 
not really
 
my mom does that huh 
but program is a very important subject in our university
 when people studying computer science or computer
engineering 
 
 is it 
 yeah yeah fair enough yeah 
fair enough
 
well i mean if you study computer science you should know that
sort of thing 
uhm uhm uhm but to me is very complicated
 
 yeah 
yeah yeah me too huh huh 
because i ' m s studying in arts you know 
arts faculty and do not have any tut 
association with computing
 
 yeah 
 uh huh 
oh yeah 
except when we are writing essays
 
oh of course
yeah me too
uhm with arts which subjects are you doing 
english uh major in english and have some
elective in the social science faculty 
 
 just english 
 uh huh 
 right yeah yeah uhm i don't have nay electives
cos i do double major 
uh huh why don't you why don't you have
 
not enough room in my degree 
 no elec uhm
 
not enough room in my degree for any electives 
uh huh
 is there an 
 
 cos i do double major that ' s why 
is there any compulsory course in your when you are double
major in economics and finance
 
well like what 
like what uh
 
what what do you mean 
uh for example uh banking ordinance or business ordinance uh
 
aw you mean covers up all the subjects 
yes
 
oh of course i 
you you don't know what i mean
 
no no no
uhm there are compulsory subjects for economics and there are
compulsory subjects for finance
 now the finance ones are business finance
 one-word uhm australian one- word 
markets investments and international business finance and al and
also applicable finance used to be uh a must as well.
for economics things like micro-economics i macro-economics i
micro-economics ii macro-economics ii probably micro-economics and
macro-economics iii as well plus the uhm econometric subjects the statistics
ones like uhm hundred methods a and b and econometric 
mono-building and uhm quantitative economics techniques and b things
like that 
 uh huh 
 uh huh 
 uhm uhm 
economics and finance involve a lot of tut thi 
calculating work or mathematics 
 
 yeah quite a bite especially the
econometrics ones
they ' re all maths pretty much all statistics all
statistics anyway yeah 
uhm we are looking at progression analysis that sort of thing
 yeah like a quarter of the subjects are we doing
 uh next 
 but 
 all maths 
 aw 
 oh 
 mathematics will draws people crazy
 
ha huh yeah uh it ' s all right it ' s not bad 
 it ' s all right for you
 
yeah 
you can manage all of them
 
that yeah i i do quite well in econometrics actually uhm 
i don't know why cos i didn't do very well in maths 
 uh huh 
better than finance
 
yeah much better 
 why 
 finance is terrible
terrible
 
aw it ' s not terrible but i haven't been doing not very good
lately
and i haven't been doing very well at all in any subjects finance
but hopefully next year i ' ll do it better
so far i ' m just passing finance 
passing finance 
 
 yeah i might get a credit in one of the subjects
uh huh what is 
 
 may be 
may be
what is your expected honours after you have graduated
 
and uh i ' m uh i ' m doing honours in economics
which means an extra year in economics with more subjects
that i have to do thesis 
 honour 
 yeah 
oh i see
 
yup
write about of no more than how many words is it
two hundred thousands i can't remember 
you are studying in new south ways university 
 
 new new south wales uh university
of new south wales 
 new south wales 
new south wales sorry
uh some of my classmate who emigrated to australia also study in
that university 
 
 yeah well that ' s the big university of uh 
in sydney or in australia
 
well both really uhm 
 both really
 
yeah uhm is one of the two because it ' s one of the two biggest
university in sydney
 in sydney the biggest universities are university of
sydney and university of new south wales 
 uh huh 
huh huh
 
uhm university of new south wales is the big one if you ' re
coming from overseas because that has i thought the highest ratio i think
thirty per cent people uh speaking different language other than english at
home at home they go to uni
that ' s what i though the most multi-cultural university new
south wales likely especially commerce
you ' re sitting in a row you see it ' s just like pick the
australian it ' s uh i think you know in the whole lecture theatre 
 is all chinese just about or all asian except 
for a few dots you know white 
 so 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
few dots
 
yeah so it ' s uh very very uhm asian-dominated field medicine as
well i think 
uhm uhm uhm tut 
what do you think about hong kong
 
it ' s all right actually 
 it ' s all right only 
 
 yeah uhm 
 is it a good place
 
because i got a lot of warnings when i left australia 
from my friends who have been here 
 huh huh 
warning
 
warnings yeah
 just about the type of place three-words
 not to trust anyone and thing like 
 aw 
huh huh not to trust anyone
 
yes you know it ' s uh a it ' s a dangerous place 
dangerous place
why
 
uhm i guess hong kong has a reputation like that uhm you know uhm
you know hong kong people 
are selfish money - oriented 
 materialistic
 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
yeah uhm 
i think they are only ngh haih no 
we are we are only just hard-working
 
yeah yeah i mean but also that you uh you can't trust anyone in
hong kong uh we always got to watch out 
that ' s terrible
 
huh huh yeah uhm 
 if you if you can't trust anyone then you have
no friends
 
yeah that ' s true yeah
uhm i guess that ' s for people coming here for short term like
just uhm just for a month for two months working here cos they don't likely
to make lots of friends when they are leaving in two months
they come two months they go uh i suppose but if
you ' re to live that ' s different
 uhm you have to try to make friends that sort of
things
 yeah uhm yeah it ' s you know i know it ' s small
and crowed and very busy 
 uhm uhm 
 uh huh 
 i see 
 like 
very busy
 
but i don't mind actually
it ' s some i mean uh i i walk fast anyway you know 
you walk and work fast
 
aw i don't know but yeah uhm the people here very nice 
 uh good to talk to and something uhm 
 yeah 
what do you like most
 
huh i don't know 
aunt reggy
 
yeah 
how about the boss
 
the boss is very nice too 
very nice
 
yeah she ' s very nice 
uhm
 
she ' been here twenty years and she speaks a little bit of
cantonese 
then she can listen cantonese
 
yeah yeah she can understand 
most of them
 
most cantonese yeah 
uhm she is very fat
she ' s quite fat in this photo
 
aw not really 
 not really 
 
 yeah i think she has lost some weight cos she ' s
not that fat when you see her personally 
uhm carol say she has tut just given birth to a baby
 
oh really i didn't know that 
 is it is it is it that the second 
bab 
 
 i don't know may be it ' s the forth one 
fourth one
 
i don't know 
so many student ngh haih no so many
children
 
yeah 
it ' s quite rare in uh
 
is it 
 two-words 
uh
 
is it in one family 
i don't know
 how 
 
 i have cos uhm i ' m used to be in hong kong we will
have a lot of big families 
uh huh
 
yeah like my mom ' s family is six three words
 eight so 
my family have eight
 
yeah eight
so that ' s i thought a big yeah 
yeah yeah still 
 very very big family 
 
i though a big family is quite common yeah yeah still 
but i think the birth rate in hong kong 
 
 has dropped 
uh dropped 
 
 yeah yeah will have to drop
china ' s still very high 
but they
 
aw that ' s why the government programme 
 haih lo that's right 
 
 yeah yeah that ' s right i ' m 
 single child policy
 
single child i thought it was two uh just one 
oh of course tut 
 
yeah 
when when some chinese woman give birth to a say uh tut
 baby girl
 
uhm 
they just kill them
 
oh really 
uhm uhm because they want to have tut 
 
a son 
yeah tut that ' s quite terrible then
 people will fear about the nineteen ninety-seven issue very much 
 because the chinese government is tut they have no reason
to do everything they say
 
 yeah that ' s true 
 yeah uh 
uhm it ' s it is a uhm a a a very one-word 
matter yeah like people worried that a lot 
uhm uhm
 
uhm uhm 
if you have no choice if you have no money to emigrate to
other country
 
uhm uhm 
 like me
 
that ' s why uhm auntie peggy is emigrating to malaysia now 
aw because the nineteen ninety-seven issue
 
yeah yeah
and my uncle has to stay here or so
it ' s family split 
huh
 
yeah my aunt and the children will go to malaysia and visit hong
kong as i suppose so
my uncle will stay in hong kong and visit malaysia in special
festival
that ' s what they will do 
why your uncle stay in hong kong
 
i don't think he can leave 
huh why
 
because he was born here i don't know uhm i don't think they will
give him immigration status
like i don't think they let him immigrate
there ' s nowhere he can go 
oh that ' s terrible
 
yeah so that ' s why he ' s stuck here and the rest of the family
their malaysian
the mom ' s malaysian can go to malay 
 why don't aunt peggy stay in hong kong with her
husband
 
cos her kids 
cos her kids
 
yeah
kids in malaysia so she can take care of them
right now they are staying with their sister 
oh i see
how many kids they have 
 
 two 
two two only 
 
 yeah 
how old are them
 
ten and five six 
 ten 
kevin is very lovely and she is very young
 
i think she ' twenty yeah 
twenty
 
i think so is that right 
nineteen years old
 
no they said she was twenty 
twenty
 
she has turned twenty now they say 
aw twenty now
 
yeah
how old are you 
it ' s secret
actually i ' m tw twenty-one
 
twenty-one 
two years older than you
 
yeah
so which year of university you are in 
sorry
 
which which year of university are you 
 final year
 
final year fourth 
no
 
no 
uhm in hong kong university you have uh th three
years only
 
all right
yeah actually it ' s the same as australia most a lot of courses
are three years some are four uhm 
differ
 
yeah yeah
law is five but that ' s double degree
medicine is six
six years
uhm commerce is three
arts is three
computer engineering if four
all engineering subjects is four i think
uhm law as usual it is a double degree so it ' s five years
medicine is six
dentistry is five astrometry is four
uh that ' s is
they ' re all around there three four five 
 uhm uhm 
 i think it ' s quite unfair because the
 
 well some you have more to learn 
more to learn
 
like medicine yeah 
aw i think medicine is a sp special case because you
are a doctor
 
yeah you have go and al also in medicine and dentistry
you have to go practice so one year spend in the field you 
 how about your course
fourth years econom 
 
 no one three years four years for honours
that ' s all
special case 
special case
three four years for honours and three years 
 for 
 
 so 
 no no no 
one years honours and three years for normal so it ' s four years
altogether 
make me confused
uhm okay we talk about your family
 
okay
what about my family 
 uhm say something
 
uhm my family uh well there ' s my mom my dad my sister and me so
four well
what do you want me to say 
what will you say
all of your family members are christian
 
yes 
because uh both of your p parents are christian so
you and sis your sister become christian too
 is it the reason
 
 uhm 
not quite 
not quite
 
it ' s not what matter two-words there are
plenty of families where the mom an dad are christian but the kids aren't
christian 
huh huh
 
and there are lots of families where the kids are christian but
the moms and dads are not christian or only one in the family is christian
something like that
so it ' s not all of my a few words are
christian are christian as well
it ' s just so happen that 
say it ' s you it is you you said it ' s a coincidence that all
of your family members are christian 
 
 not quite a coincidence 
not quiet a coincidence
it ' s uh because uhm my parents are christian so they go church
 and so as children we also go to church with them yeah as
a family so uh we go to church and expose to christian
friends 
 uh huh 
 yeah i see 
so your whole will f will f uhm go to church on
sundays
 
yes that ' s right 
that ' s right
aw i see
uhm
 
but once you get old enough you make decisions yourself uh you
know 
do you have any girlfriends in australia
 none 
 
 no 
no 
why
 
what do you mean why 
 aren't you go dating uh with other girls
 
is it a a a defect not have girlfriend in hong kong 
no i have none
 
you too
and you are older than me 
because uh in the faculty of arts we have tut f
f fair fair fair uh numbers of boys
 
all right 
many most of the are girls
how can uh get dating with
 
 really oh i see that ' s interesting 
that ' s the actual case
 
uh you should you should two words
 cos in the engineering faculty and and like
 one-word electrical engineering there ' s a girl i know
in electrical engineering and she ' s always surround by boys because there ' s
no there ' s no there ' s it ' s not it ' s 
 and 
 that i see i see 
 even even though the girls are very ugly or
 
well i don't know but uhm it ' s the ration it ' s like one to a
hundred serious uhm may be uhm a hundred guys to a girl or or
at least fifty in one-word in electric
engineering 
 uhm uhm 
 i think people studying in uh economics are half
and a half
 
about half half i think in commerce 
you can choose one
you can choose one
any of them
 
well i don't have a target yet 
oh you have not target you have no target
 
 a lot a a lot of people are uhm couples already
many many because commerce is half half so
 there ' s less available 
 uh huh 
 uh huh 
will you choose chinese people uh 
 
 yeah yes i will 
why
 
uhm partly because my parents will uh be more happy 
uhm uhm
 
and uh partly because i don't you know uhm why not 
why not uhm
 
i ' d like to yeah 
you like uhm 
 
 besides there ' s lots of chinese people in
australia 
how many
 
i don't know in my university is at least thirty per cent in my
course it ' s at least per cent huh so 
 oh that ' s great there ' s a very high 
percentage 
 
 very very high yeah 
are they beautiful
 
some are same as hong kong some are some aren't
