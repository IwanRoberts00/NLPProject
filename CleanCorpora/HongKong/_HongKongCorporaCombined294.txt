uh ladies and gentlemen first of all i would like to thank all of you for coming this evening to attend this seminar and uhm it is indeed my pleasure and my privilege to be able to share some of my experience in this area with you and i i know that your time is invaluable so your attendance at this seminar obviously speaks for itself because it obviously demonstrates the vast interest demonstrated by the profession in this great area of our conveyancing system now the the background concerning this nomination as uhm most of you would be aware is that uhm uh towards the end of the nineteen eighties uhm solicitors firms in hong kong are becoming more and more aware of the issue and uhm in fact uhm during the nineteen eighties the law society have introduced a more detailed form of nomination under which the original purchaser will expressly waive his right to the property this is commonly considered to be sufficient to avoid the problem uhm but the difficulties with the earlier forms of bare nominations however still remains and the profession will probably have to continue to live with it for several more years to come  in the meantime owing to this growing awareness of the nomination problem more and more requisitions are being raised in respect to these older forms of nomination which are generally considered to to be doubtful and would require the most careful consideration in each and every particular case on the other hand there are plenty of this dreadful forms about so not surprisingly the one-word area has been fast developing and lately there have been a number of significant decisions affecting this area uhm the latest decision of which i am aware is the judgment delivered by bocaric jay on the twenty sixth september nineteen ninety one which has just come out a few days ago uhm uh uh and become available to the outside world and it has not yet been noted in the current issues of the hong kong law 1-word uh hong kong law digest uhm in hong kong the common belief which is supported by many authorities is that the purchaser is entitled to nominate a nominee to take on the assignment now this outlet has become quickly adopted by some ingenious hong kong practitioners as an alternative means of effecting a sub-sale without the need to joining the original purchaser as a confirmor  the reason why they don't use the con confirm law  method is because uhm usually uhm uh the original purchaser would no longer be around by the time it gets to the actual completion and so the nomination method uhm was being used to bridge this time gap so as you ' re all aware a typical nomination would usually involve the following first of all you have the original purchaser signing a set purchase agreement and in this zone purchase agreement the vendor would then acknowledge receipt of the deposit uhm and and say that it ' s uh from the original purchaser and then prior to completion the purchaser would then execute an an nomination to nominate somebody else to take on the assignment and then the assignment would be conveyed into the name of the nominee and and because uhm uhm under the uhm conveyancing of property ordinance uhm the requirement of a written memorandum doesn't apply to uh things like resulting trust and so on so uhm uh uhm the the question will arise uh as to whether or not uhm under these circumstances there can be a resulting trust arising in favor of the original purchaser since he would be the person who signed the original agreement and provided the initial deposit  the uh the first case that ' s really on the subject uhm was a case called full trend uh which was decided uhm on the seventh of may nineteen ninety by godfrey in that case the judge held that there was no blot on the title because of the particular circumstances of the case which he referred to in the judgment now since the facts of that case are very important to a proper understanding of the whole picture and the subsequent developments of the law so i think i must summarize them uhm in fair detail here even though i ' m sure that most of you would would already have been aware of the basic features of that decision uhm when i when i do this summary i would ask you to bear in mind the importance of the dates because uhm uhm this is important to distinguish this case from the subsequent cases now in the full trend case the two original purchasers uhm of the properties uhm signed the two agreements for sale and purchase  with the vendors these two agreements were dated the fifteenth july nineteen eighty two  about three months afterwards a new company was incorporated on the nineteenth novem uh nineteenth october nineteen eighty two and the two original purchasers were also the directors and shareholders of this company another few months later on the eleventh of august nineteen eighty three the two purchasers executed nominations to nominate the company to take up the properties however these nominations did not explain uhm the nature of the transaction or why it was that they came to nominate the company but in the result the properties were conveyed to the company on the same date of the nomination which was the eleventh august nineteen eighty three after that there was one very important supervening event which was on about one and a half year later on the sixteenth march nineteen eighty five the company conveyed the properties to a subsequent buyer in this conveyance the company expressly assigned uh the property as beneficial owner and the assignment was further executed by the two original purchasers uhm on behalf of the company because they were also directors of the company now that was the back background of the case and the subject dispute uhm involved a a further transaction a further years down the line uhm and and and whe when when the properties became the subject of another sale and the solicitors for the new purchasers raised requisitions on the grounds that uh uh these nominations did not say who actually provided the deposit and who were the actual purchasers and why uhm the nominations were effected and so they say that uhm the question of resulting trust arose the matter came before godfrey and he held that uhm uhm the objection to the title was misconceived he said that the properties were conveyed to the company at the direction of the two original purchasers so having cloaked the company with a mantle of authority to deal with the properties the company then sold it uhm with the two original purchasers signing the assignment so the judge he said that that means that the two original purchasers had concurred in the assignment and in fact the assignment also said that the two origin  uh the the company was conveyed as beneficial owner so under these circumstances uhm the judge said that the two original purchasers could no longer possibly assert any title to the uhm equitable interest against the new purchaser or any successor in title uhm uhm because uhm the purchaser from the company was induced to pay over the purchase price to the company by reason of the conduct of the two original purchasers now since the uh decision on that case at one stage uhm that case has been uh hailed by many people as providing a final solu solution to the problem however uhm uhm uh a few months ago in an article which uhm which i wrote uh in the new gazette uhm i have drawn attention to the fact that uhm if we were to analyze the judgment uhm uh we we might find that uhm this kind of joy might perhaps having too early because uhm uhm first of all we can see that the fu the  full trend case was concerned with some very special facts and and secondly there ' s certain uh uh obiter dictum  from judged in that decision which might uhm make it uh make make the problem worse than before the other thing is that uhm the decision in that case was given by the judge uhm on a as a extempore judgment that is he he gave the decision immediately after the hearing he didn't actually uhm take time to consider and reserve his judgment now that means uhm uhm he decided the the the case on a very narrow issue and he did not deal with the many uh wide-ranging sub  uh issues submitted by counsel uhm as a result uhm the impact of the full trend  case has become a rather strange one because first of all it ' s limited because of the exceptional facts of the case and secondly uhm uhm there ' s some uh dictum from the judge which i think went too far  now as i ' ve just mentioned the the decisive factor in the  full trend case was that uhm the two original purchasers uhm were the were also the two individuals who actually caused the assignment uhm uh from the nominee company to the subsequent purchaser and so in a sense the court has almost seen through the veil and said well the two original purchasers was also the company and if for instance if a subsequent purchaser were induced by the acts of these two individuals to pay over the purchase price to the company and then the two original uh purchasers would be allowed to come back later and say oh well actually we we still have an interest in the property uh by way of resulting trust that would almost have been a fraud on the subsequent purchaser so not surprisingly uhm the judge i think uhm quite rightly uhm held that uhm uh no possible resulting trust could arise but uhm of course after analyzing this case uhm we can see that uhuh uhm the the the facts of the full trend case might not necessarily be same be the same in all other transactions for instance uhm in subsequent transactions you might have only one director uh uh executing uhm the subsequent assignment uhm or for instance uhm there might be no supervening transaction all that you have is just uh uh uh one transaction and then immediately after that you have a a subsequent sale so all these would mean that the full trend case might not be of universal application and and in the meantime apart from this there is a very alarming thing which suggests that uhm the the problem of resulting trust might in fact be worse than before because uhm in that case you see apart from actually making the ruling the court started off by saying that uhm when you have uh two individuals signing the original agreement and then they make a nomination a fair nomination the court said uhm uh he accepted that at that stage the equitable interest in the property might well have remained outstanding in the two original purchases uhm although he added that not every case might have this result but he proceeded on the footing that there is at the very least a real possibility of a resulting trust uhm now this is uh this has made the thing very difficult because that means uhm if there is a real possibility that means the title is doubtful and you cannot force the dot the the title on a reluctant purchaser uhm so in my article in this new gazette uhm i suggested that the law in this regard was in fact far from settled and so each case must be carefully considered in the light of its own merits and i predicted that uhm there will be further developments uhm in the years to come now as it turned out there were indeed further developments  because uh uh after some thirteen days after the delivery of this full trend judgment thirteen days another case came before mr justice  balcari on the fifteenth of may nineteen ninety in the case of lee ho kee and fung kau  in this case they also ruled in favour of a good title being shown despite the presence of a similar problem uhm in that case it was a very short piece of judgment and the judge held that looking at the whole of the matter there was no reasonable prospect that the original purchaser will be able to successfully assert any interest uhm as a result of this decision another very brief article appeared in a june issue of the new gazette which was uhm just prior to my article and it was noted that the problems concerning nominations might have been cleared by reason of this ruling this i suppose would have been a very sensible result but unfortunately i don't really think that this case can be regarded as being any real authority at all because this is the case first of all it was decide in chambers and was not decided in open court whereas the full trend was decided in open court secondly uhm this uhm chambers decision was obviously concluded uhm uh in ignorance of the full trend judgment because the  full trend judgment was given uhm say thirteen days ago and and as i said it was given orally so it needed time to be typed out so nobody i think would would would have been aware of that decision uhm uh during uh at the time of the lee ho kee decision
