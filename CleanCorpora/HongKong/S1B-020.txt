<I>
uhm before looking into the poem that we are reading this
year i think it may be helpful if we can narrow down several
areas which may help us to understand a poem certain area which may help
us to appreciate the poem
so in other words what i shall be talking now is more of uh 
techniques the so called techniques use by the poet or another name
 for this one techniques nowadays uh which is more popular is
the word stylistic 
in other word where uhm or i ' d like to spend some time in 
identifying some areas which we may detect the area which we may notice
the techniques that come out so that we can be more aware so that we can be
more sensitive when when we read
or in other words when we read at least we know where to read where
to find things that we may be helpful to understand it okay 
uhm i think we ' re bet i think that that there can
be three areas three area which we can look into or three areas
which we may be more sensitive when we are reading 
and the first area is what we call lexis which actually
means vocabulary 
in other word when one direction one area which we may pay
attention to is the words chosen or in other words were the choice of
words the choice of words of the writer
and this can be broken down into several areas say for
example uhm in the adjectives we may like to think what kind of
adjectives what kind of adjectives 
is it about colour what kind of colour skin that we
may have if there are adjective related to colour alright
say for example were in uhm in nineteen eighty four as you may
remember that we may pay attention to the description of the colour and that
may bring us some idea of the surrounding or that may bring us some idea of
how george orwell see london under the rule of one-word 
in other word when through the colour words or through the
adjectives which convey certain colour alright this may help us to get a
certain idea 
or the other senses words that are related to other senses 
like smell or touching or hearing different thing right
or are there adjectives related to certain kind of values
say for example right with adjectives convey value like say for
example a kind angry wicked so on and so forth whether he is a good
person or bad person what kind of person what kind of value that this person
had
in other word uh when we look at adjective we try to look at
 what kind of adjective here
does it convey colour does it convey smell or does it convey the
other senses or does it convey any value or any judgment any opinion any
judgment from the poet by the use of the adjectives 
then the other is verb 
now uhm i would not like to make this too complicated right but
uh for your level or for your benefit i think i we may pay attention
to the nature of verbs whether it is dynamic or whether it is static 
when we say of it when we say a a verb is dynamic it means that the
verb is suggesting a kind of very violent or energetic action 
say for example uhm compare these right i kill him or i stab
him 
or okay that ' s two-words comparatively
which is more violent bonnie
 
verb 
stab 
yes right
or between i kill him and i stab him the interaction stab is
far more violent and this is what we call a dynamic verb because the verb
itself suggest a lot of action a lot of energy involved in the way pronounce
the verb stab
stab kill much softer kill is nothing kill 
or uhm a long pause when i say he is knocked
down by car 
he ' s knocked down by a car or he had a car accident 
compare these two again he has car accident static is nothing
but because when the word had is a very static word
the word static means uh without any movement without any action
right because something which is static that may something which is not
moving something which is still that is static right
he had a car accident right is nothing
we don't know what actually happen we don't feel the horror we
don't feel the pain
but if i say he he is knocked down by a car then right knocked
down by the car right the verb itself right 
or he is smashed say for example right he is smashed the the verb
itself suggest a lot of action okay a long pause 
so uh one one thing were that we may pay attention to uh is to look
at the verb whether they are dynamic verbs or static verb right a long
pause 
and i don't know i don't know whether you are aware of
these
the other implication the other thing that you may look at is
whether the verb is transitive or intransitive 
do you know what transitive verbs are or if you don't know
right forget it
or i i don't want to confuse you
now uhm transitive verbs are verbs which must be follow by an
object otherwise it is grammatically wrong that is a transitive verb that is
a verb which is follow by an object or say for example the verb enjoy 
you cannot say i enjoy very much full stop
well that definitely that is wrong right
what do you enjoy that is the point
because the verb enjoy is a transitive verb that is it must be
follow by an object i enjoy myself at least
or eyt is called enjoy yourself tonight not enjoy not it is not
called enjoy tonight right enjoy yourself tonight right
and there are some verbs which are intransitive which cannot be
follow by any object 
then of course wherein in english language right most of the verbs
are both transitive and intransitive
but we may be a bit sensitive or we may like to be a to be
more aware if we notice that a writer write in a certain way that there
is no object all the time
there must be some some reason right
there must be some reason when he chooses to write sentences
without any object
it cannot be accidental alright if every sentence or most sentences
are like that right
and then in that case where we try to think why he uses such a
pattern in relation to what he is writing okay a long pause 
and of course right we been look at the images
this you are very familiar right
in other words where that the words which can be group
together the word which can be group together or the words which could
have uh thematic link that they belong to a certain group right
say for example uhm if i say star moon sun cloud sky or fog
even though like they are different item and yet right they can be
group together right
because when they all fall within the same group or in other word
where there are uhm thematic link right
and uh all these words all these star star moon sun sky
all all these if you like where they ' re elements of nature 
they ' re element of nature right
so this case where we may like to call them you may if you like
call them the images call them they ' re the use of nature images in the
poem right you should know call these images 
so uhm i think when last year or when you were in form four or form
three you pay comparatively more attention to images
but uhm now you may also like to look at the choice of other words
adjectives and verbs so that it may give us more ideas so that it may give us
more dimension in reading a poem right from a viewpoint of lexis from the
viewpoint of the choice of words a long pause 
now the next area is the area of grammar 
uhm say for example we may look at the sentence construction 
we may look at at sentence construction 
is it indicative is it imperative 
yeah by the way were you know all these are indicative 
imperative you know what it is
no i ' ll i ' ll explain right 
interrogative or subjunctive 
now imperative it if the sentence is written in a con 
imperative form it mean that it ' s no subjects 
that is usually spoken by the teacher
do this do that go out you shut up keep quiet or 
three words 
keep quiet shut up don't run things like that
in other words like that uhm in the sentence like there is no
subject right only the verb
to begin a sentence with a verb without any subject this is what we
call imperative
or if you don't like the word were too difficult
imperative
you may say right order it is an order or it is a command right 
and of course were this the use of this may may mean
or may suggest power alright
the one speaking in such a way is actually exercising or using his
power so that the subject is omitted so that the subject is non- existed
alright
power very often by the use of imperative is an indication of the
power that ' s the speaker is using or the power that he is enjoying 
so indicative that is the normal sentence that is the normal
sentence pattern right that is you have the subject or verb and then
the object to indicate something to tell you something this 
a very factual a very factual sentence with the subject verb object
to tell you something to indicate something to you right
and then interr interrogative that is question 
question
you know the word interrogation interrogation means question
you know the word interrogation one- word 
has a section of interrogation with three words 
 two-words 
interrogation means question
if a sentence is purely written in a question form then
you ' d better you ' d better watch up
or written in subjunctive form you know subjunctive
if i were if i had something something right
uh these are the areas that we may pay attention to 
or to continue with the sentence construction a long pause 
uhm the voice of the sentence the voice of the sentence may
also tell us something that we may notice whether it is written in
active voice or it is written in the passive voice a long pause 
 say example uhm i clean the blackboard or the
blackboard is clean 
what is the difference between these two sentences
if i say i i clean the blackboard or the blackboard is cleaned
is there any difference 
the difference is that right in the sentence i clean the blackboard
the emphasis is the word i oh 
in every sentence the first word is the word which is being
emphasized
so in this case i clean the blackboard means that is i not you
i clean the blackboard whereas the blackboard is cleaned the one
who is cleaning the blackboard the one who who clean that the blackboard is
not important
what is more important is the blackboard right
and that ' s why it ' s written in passive voice and the blackboard
is put into the beginning right 
or further example the passive voice the use of passive
voice very often may imply that person that person is passive 
that person is not powerful or that person is weak a long pause 
and uhm we may also notice sometime were whether it is
complex sentence or whether it is simple sentence 
if it is complex sentence were what kind of complex
sentence 
these are the few areas that may that we may find helpful
or another item is there any inversion 
is there any inversion you know inversion 
or is there any change change of tense within the poem or
within the passage that you are reading
if you notice like there is a sudden change of tense then
you ' d better watch up you you better be careful and try why and try ask
yourself why is there such a change of tense alright a long pause 
and and lastly lastly and you we may look at uhm 
phonology that we say which means were the sound effect
sound effect or the aspect of sound 
now under this category one- word we may look
at alliteration 
you know what alliteration is
alliteration that is the repeated use the repeated use of
the same consonant a long pause 
in other words right if on one line you get three or four same
consonant at the same time then it may produce a certain kind of sound effect
which is very distinctive to your ear so you can hear it
now the more frequent one one-word one one is
the s sound the s sound the s alliteration
it can be very frequent
the s alliteration were may have several effect
one is this can create a very soft atmosphere or this can
create a sleepy atmosphere or lazy atmosphere or a heavy sound 
in other words where it if the poem is about something which is
very quiet right surrounding or the atmosphere which is supposed to be
quiet then you may notice the lot of s sound
but if you if you refer to the poem that you read last year the
listener that you may find a lot of s there right 
and then the l sound the l
the l is again right it is a very light sound it may it may
convey a light or lazy feeling 
that ' s why lazy is spelt as l a z y
we get the l sound and the s sound mean it lazy right
the l sound is a very lazy sound
