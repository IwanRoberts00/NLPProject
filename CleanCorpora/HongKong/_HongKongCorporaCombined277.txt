few will disagree with the education commission ' s observation  in its recently publish report number six that a comprehensive strategy must be develop to enhance the proficiency of chinese and english  of young people in hong kong  otherwise our workforce will quickly lose its competitiveness in the asia-pacific region  many will also welcome the thirty-eight proposals set out in the report aimed at enhancing language proficiency and calling for substantial amounts of new resources for language education  before deciding to spend more on ed on language education however we should take a hard look at the outcome of what has already been spent  for if the importance of chinese language skills has only been recognised recently the same is not true for english  a child in hong kong begins learning english in kindergarten  at the age of four  in primary and secondary school english language is a subject that takes up the largest number of teaching hours exceeding chinese or mathematics  by the time a student leaves school he or she will have spent more time learning english than it takes a university undergraduate  to work for a degree  in addition for over eighty-five percent of the secondary school population who learn the science and humanities in english a large of proportion of their work on these subjects is actually tackling language problems  our youngsters attend remedial english cla classes in the school and outside  the british council has been doing a lucrative business  providing english courses for students who should be learning the language  in their own school  veteran english teachers quit their school job to run tutorial classes of outrageous sizes and charging exorbitant fees  english learning programs are broadcast regularly by radio and television  chinese newspapers carry english columns bilingual sections  bookshops fill their shelves with books tapes videos and electronic devices that purport to help people achieve what they have failed to do in school namely to learn english  a visitor from outside who notices this thriving business in english language education will easily think that the hong kong population has the highest english standard in the world of non-native speakers until he tries to communicate in english with someone in the street  local people specially employers and admission officers of the tertiary institutions are despondently aware of the de  deficiency in english language skills of our school leavers  the worst problem with the english language education in hong kong is not this poor results but the inestimable amount of resources it has expended to obtain such results  so much has been done in teaching and learning english and so little has been achieved in relation to the resources expended that there must be some fundamental mistake in the way of doing things here the education commission identifies a number of factors that have  contri contributed to hong kong ' s long-lasting language proficiency problems  these include a lack of a coherent framework for planning and implementing language policies in education ill-informed attitude towards languages inadequate education for teachers out-dated curriculum design and inadequate support infrastructure for schools and teachers the shortage of properly trained teachers may be a problem more acute for languages especially for english than for other school subjects  as mentioned in the report people who have received academic and professional training in the english language have a wide choice of careers and are seldom attracted to the teaching profession  problems in education and administration and curriculum planning  suggested in the report the obstacles to enhancing language proficiency  are less convincing  it is difficult to believe that in the past hong kong has done much more poorly in the languages than in other areas of the school curriculum  there has been no lack of research in curriculum innovations in language education for example compared with similar work for other subjects  the report mentions ill-informed attitude towards languages  unfortunately without elaborating  in fact it appears some of these ill-informed attitudes are preventing the education commission from making correct judgements  the biggest mistake in our language education i believe is to teach english as if it were a second popular language in the territory compared with other colonial powers the british have been particularly successful in propagating their language and culture  in many places which were formerly british colonies english in not only constitutionally designated as an official language but it ' s also widely used at home and at school at work and on social occasions the children in these places learn english as their second  or even their first language  hong kong is a remarkable exception  english has never been a second language here and it is most unlikely that it would ever be  the average hong kong chinese seldom listens to an english radio channel or watches a tv programme in english without chinese sub-titles  he does not speak english to other members of his family  although he may have to deal with english documents in his office  when he converses with his chinese colleagues he will use at most a mixed code sparsely sprinkled to english  to all intent and purposes english remains a foreign language in hong kong important in education and at work little used otherwise perhaps rather unexpectedly the growth in our affluence has further reduced the chance of necessary exposure to english in our everyday life  the abundance of local productions means that people no longer need to understand english to enjoy reading watching television going to the cinema or attending pop concerts  teachers find it more and more difficult to think of genuine situations that will convince their children of the need to learn to communicate in english  yet our language educators keep on deceiving themselves about the status of the language in our community  they set objectives demanding that our students should master english as a second language and it is taught as if it were one  the strategy of our english language education is very simple  start early and get a lot of exposure  our language teachers may have attained their proficiency in english through this natural way of language acquisition  but to many local children an early start simply means an early tendency to give up and exposure outside the classroom is practically not available  it is no surprise that the expensive scheme of hiring expatriate english teachers in our schools has often failed to provide the kind of help that most of our students need  a competent teacher of a foreign language has to master both the target language and the mother tongue of her pupils  not only must the teacher be aware of specific problems arising from mother tongue interference  she must also be able to communicate efficiently with those she teaches  you cannot teach someone you do not understand  in learning a foreign language one ' s mother tongue should be used as a toll as tool not pushed aside as something that should be kept out of the way  it is essential that both teacher and student can make effective use of this tool  instead of trying to become bilingual at the start of schooling  it is preferable for at least a proportion of the local children to defer learning english as foreign language until a later stage when they have attained a basic level of proficiency in their first language this was in fact one of the more well-founded recommendations put forward by the working group on language proficiency set up earlier by the education commission  however the commission ' s position on that recommendation is equivocal in the face of strong objections raised by the public  stark example of ill-informed attitude  we have to reset our goals and rethink our approach  i hope the new standing committee on language education and research recommended to be set up in the education commission ' s report  will set the course for development in the right direction  when our schools begin to teach english as a decent foreign language our students will learn it more happily and efficiently the preliminary working committee the pwc is coming to the end of its controversial existence  it will dissolve after holding its final plenary meeting next month  making way for the preparatory committee that will be formed early next year  the pwc has been accused of being illegitimate by some people  in the territory  its members have been criticised for lacking in representativeness  credibility integrity and common sense  there have been frequent allegations that the business of the pwc is to make sinister plots to betray hong kong  hardly has there been any idea put forward by the pwc that has escaped castigation  proposals that have drawn particularly massive and ferocious attacks include plans for forming a provisional legislature upon the transfer of government and the treatment of the bill of rights ordinance  recently suggested by the legal sub-group  but controversy also surrounds the working body ' s news on issues like the definition of permanent residents ' status management of land funds assessment of academic qualifications and preparing school textbooks for nineteen ninety-seven  unlike the preparatory committee which has always been a part of china ' s plans for the hand-over arrangement the pwc was formed only in consequence of the breakdown in sino-british co-operation when both sides resorted to unilateral actions and beijing realised there was a host of problems that could not be left unaddressed until the establishment of the preparatory committee in nineteen ninety-six  by design the work of the pwc is controversial  its areas of concern are precisely those where conflicting opinions are heard are held by beijing and london and by opposing political camps in hong kong  where there is already consensus or co-operation the pwc has no part to play  given the antagonistic circumstances in which the pwc was formed  and the contentious nature of the issues it deals with one can hardly expect unanimous support in the territory for the proposals it makes  too often the pwc is more concerned with revealing and defeating sabotage plots of the british real or imagined than with winning people ' s heart and minds  very few people in hong kong would feel thankful to the pwc members for what they have done  this is unfair to them for most of then have in fact been honestly trying to act in the best interest of hong kong  it should be realised that the controversies have not been created by the pwc  with or without the pwc the transition problems are there  most of which ensuing from the breakdown of mutual trust and co-operation between china and britain and between hong kong and beijing  even if these problems had not been accentuated by the pwc and attracted public debate they would not have disappeared  without the work of the pwc disputes about all these problems would only be postponed until the final months before the transfer of government with poorer chances of obtaining viable solutions  it is not the pwc that decides for example the the term of office of the last pre-nineteen ninety-seven legislature cannot last beyond the change of government  that was ordained by the failure of the sino-british talks two years ago  the pwc is given the task of looking into problems that will arise without the legislature through train  it has to make suggestions as to when and how the first post-british legislature should be elected and what interim measures should be taken before the elections can be held  the idea of forming a provisional legislature has been conceived as the best possible solution  despite harsh criticisms from opponents of this proposal no viable alternative has been put forward by them  similarly it is not because the pwc has found fault with the hong kong bill of rights ordinance that its status becomes contentious  people familiar with the back ground of th the ordinance will know that right form the beginning of its existence china has maintained that its status is inconsistent with the basic law and therefore the ordinance cannot survive the nineteen ninety-seven hand-over perhaps few people are aware that as a result of deliberations within the pwc chinese government ' s recent declaration of its position  is equivalent to a promise that despite beijing ' s previous objections the bill of rights ordinance will remain in hong kong statute-books after nineteen ninety-seven  for the time being however i am afraid nobody will be interested in appeals against injustice to pwc members  with the pwc winding up its business and organization of the preparatory committee underway people are now turning their attention to the new body with euphoric expectations  they hope the new committee will include representatives of a wider spectrum of views and will conduct its business in a more open and transparent way  nobody can cast any doubt on the legitimacy of the preparatory committee or its power to make arrangements for the establishment of the special administrative region  the present hong kong government has promised to give the new committee support which was denied to the pwc  i do very much hope that the preparatory committee can proceed with its work more smoothly and with more co-operation and support from all sides than the pwc  it must be realised however that the contentions connected with the pwc are not to become history together with the body itself  the preparatory committee will pick up where the pwc leaves off the pwc started its work with the list of the tasks of the preparatory committee  as the result of its work the pwc will pass on to the preparatory committee a report containing proposals on how these tasks can best be carried out  most if not all of the pwc members will probably be reappointed by the chinese government to sit on the preparatory committee  even if the preparatory committee includes a numbers of new members with different opinions it is unlikely that it can stray very much from the recommendations of the pwc  large part of its work will simply be implementing controversial plans the pwc has announced like forming a provisional legislature  preparing for new elections after the new government takes over and providing chinese national people ' s congress with the list of hong kong laws that should be repealed for contravening the basic law
