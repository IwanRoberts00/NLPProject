  good evening and welcome to newsline  it was just over a week ago that the governor chris patten announced that anson chan is to succeed sir david ford to become the first local chief secretary  mrs chan will take over the top job next month  well joining us in the studio this week is the chief secretary designate anson chan  welcome to the program  thank you   reacting to the news chinese officials have said privately that in fact it ' s been the governor ' s personal likes and dislikes and political inclination which has dictated and perhaps influenced the decisions behind the latest government reshuffle which has seen you promoted to chief secretary  is it because you support the governor and his policies that has seen uh your promotion  when the governor i recollect was interviewed uh earlier this year about the sort of qualities that he would be looking for in the next chief secretary i think he said that he would be looking for honesty  integrity ability and a full commitment to the community of hong kong since then of course he has announced his choice for a successor to sir david ford and i believed that in general the community ' s response has been reasonably warm  uhm so i rest on that  uhm my qualities and my service uh are well known and i think that i can reaffirm my commitment to the people of hong kong and to serve to the best of my ability   there were actually no other contenders for the job  would you say that  there wasn't   i wouldn't say that  i think that uh uh there are other officers with perhaps not as long a service as i have but with very considerable experience and excellent qualities  so as the governor made clear he had a number of choices and he made his choice based on his assessment of who ' s best suited for the job not his personal likes or dislikes    uhm one of those   uhm  one of those contenders though was john chan  and john chan has now resigned from the civil service because it was reputed that he disagreed with the governor and it was made clear to him that he wasn't ever going to become chief secretary  so i ' ll ask you again do you support the governor and the policies which he is now putting forward  i have enjoyed working with john chan for a great number of years he is a fine officer  but as he has himself made clear he left the service for personal reasons not because he disagreed with the policies of the governor  i support the governor ' s commitment to the people of hong kong  i have reaffirmed my own commitment to the people of hong kong and i will serve in that spirit  mrs chan i have been reading xu jia tuen ' s memoirs and one of the things he mentioned in his memoirs uhm is the fact that the through train doesn't just apply to legislative councilors  the concept also applies to civil servants  now uh is it possible that come nineteen ninety-seven china will come in as the sovereign power and china would say well uhm your appointment as chief secretary uh was not brought up for discussion  china ' s view on this matter was not sought therefore we do not feel that we should be honor bound to keep mrs chan as chief secretary do you see that eventuality happening not just to you personally but to a whole host of civil servants in important positions like the secretary for the civil service the secretary for economics services  financial secretary and so on uhm  i think that we must take as our first reference the provisions in the basic law which says that principal official posts will have to be filled by chinese nationals with no right of abode in any foreign country uhm that provided we meet this criteria that officers continue to serve in the interest of the future sar government and the people of hong kong  that they may continue to serve after nineteen ninety-seven  that said uh i accept that of course none of us can be absolutely certain about what future we may have in the sar government after nineteen ninety-seven  i think that i know what i want from life and my personal career whether i continue after nineteen ninety-seven is not by any means the most important  i have had a very good beginning to my service uh with the hong kong government i was fortunate enough to enter the administrative service which has traditionally provided the backbone of administrators and which continues to provide an excellent service to the community of hong kong  i would hope in the same way that i have had a good beginning to have a good end and that is that when the time comes for me to go whenever that might be i will do so graciously and with a clear  conscience   but the point is would you not think that this is something which worries civil servants at this particular juncture i fully accept it does worry as i have said already we must take as our first reference point the provisions in the joint declaration and the basic law and the chinese i think on many occasions have reaffirmed that they intend to faithfully implement the joint declaration  uh whilst   uhm   if in the event that they do not come nineteen ninety-seven first of july if at that point they say some of you will have to come off the train what do you think the civil servants ' reaction would be i think there is no disagreement uh uh that we must have continuity in the civil service  uh whilst the british and the hong kong government remain responsible for the administration of hong kong up to thirtieth of june nineteen ninety-seven uhm the choice obviously in the final analysis rests with the hong kong government  that said because of the need for continuity i think that in reality it makes a a great deal of sense for the hong kong government to start a dialogue with the chinese in terms of the acceptability of senior officials continuing after nineteen ninety-seven   when do you think that will take  place    will you be doing that  uhm we have not yet decided on the final date i think it would have to be probably in the next two to three years   mrs chan you ' re going to be fifty-seven in nineteen ninety-seven that ' s normally the retirement age for civil servants  so although you ' ve pledged to stay on and serve beyond that date is it realistic really that you are going to be staying on as chief secretary beyond nineteen ninety-seven  well actually uh fifty-seven is not the normal retirement age for a civil servant fifty-seven has been chosen as the guideline for expatriate officers to retire in order to make way for suitable local officers so that we are in a position to implement the provisions in the joint declaration  as i have already said in an earlier response uh i cannot be absolutely certain about my own future after nineteen ninety-seven  i will serve for as long as i am needed and as long as i am in have the capacity to do so   now you ' ve said in a recent newspaper article that in fact the the fact that you have actually been promoted to chief secretary means that the governor ' s policy of localization is alive and well but in the same article you also wrote that the chief secretary at the moment had served for six and a half years in the job the longest serving chief secretary do you think perhaps he stayed for too long and the localization of your job should have started earlier  uhm i think the entire community and the legislature will recognize  that sir david has served with great distinction as the chief secretary  uhm uh it is not for me to say whether he should have been replaced earlier or later  uhm i think that the the timing now is probably as good as any   and we remain uh fully confident that we will have in place suitable local officers in accordance with the joint declaration in good time  before nineteen ninety-seven    so  but you say that at the moment the average age of policy secretaries has reduced from i think was it fifty-three to forty-six    that well does that mean that in fact abilities and standards are dropping because some of these local officers are having to be promoted quickly because of the need to localize   yes  uh we will obviously not promote uh any officer local or otherwise to any specific post unless we are clearly satisfied that he or she can meet the requirements of the job  uhm we are giving every opportunity for suitable local officers to have the necessary exposure uh and experience and as i say we remain fully confident that we will be able to implement the provisions in the joint declaration    th there are still eight though expatriate officers who are holding the jobs of policy secretaries how soon do you think the rest of the top level the top strata of government now is going to be localized  i think there ' s probably eight or nine  uh we would as i say hope to uhm have all these posts filled by suitably qualified local officers in good time before nineteen ninety-seven civil servants are going to be very important in the transition period obviously the governor cannot govern without the support of a civil service and uh it would be your job the job of the chief secretary to make sure that he does have the support now however in these last few years uh i ' m sure you will agree  that the politics of hong kong has taken on a totally different hue from previous years and that more and more civil servants are being called upon uhm to share power with legislative councilors  uhm from what i have seen this seems to be a difficult thing to do because they perhaps have got used to the old style of administration and today of course you now have civil servants who are finding it difficult to make the transition uh perhaps for that reason some of them are looking for jobs elsewhere now do you do you think the the for instance the administrative officers will be able to cope uh with the new demands that are being  placed on them and and the new ethos of the times i agree that we live uh in a highly politicized uh atmosphere uh and for many of us particularly for those of us who joined in the uh fifties and sixties uh there are some very radical changes  uhm and because of that uncertainty and the need to change i felt it necessary very shortly after i took on the job of the secretary for the civil service to get to see each and every policy secretary and each and every head of department in order to uhm uh have their views on how they see the service uh developing what are some of their worries  and one of the things that struck me was that notwithstanding the fact that we are having to deal with a very new style uh legislative council uhm with many issues uh politicized uh most of them thought that uh morale remained very high that they had adapted uh if not well at least willingly to changes that they see the need to continue to adapt and i was very very uh gratified to learn that each and every civil servant remains fully committed to adapting to these changes in order to respond to the   community ' s needs   i i somehow get the reverse impression of that i get the impression that a lot of senior civil servants uhm do not regard some of the legislative councillors as their intellectual equals  and they find it very very difficult to have to account for their actions in front of a bunch of people who they do not respect   i think your answer will have to be brief mrs chan  in the same way as i think uh civil servants have to demonstrate their uh abilities uh and their commitment i think legislative councillors probably will fully appreciate uh and acknowledge that they too have to demonstrate their leadership qualities and their commitment not just participate in politicizing issues   well that brings an end to this first half of the program but join us in just a few minutes when we ' ll be continuing our discussion with the chief secretary designate anson chan commercial break    welcome back to the second part of newsline and joining us on the program this week is the chief secretary designate anson chan  we ' ve been talking to mrs chan about the policy of localization and the reasons for her own promotion into the job of chief secretary we move now on perhaps mrs chan to discuss a little bit more about some of the issues which you ' re going to be facing once you take  over the job and i think probably top of the list is uhm hong kong ' s relations with china we ' ve seen this weekend the failure of the two foreign secretaries to reach any agreement on the political reforms for hong kong ' s future  is it now inevitable that mr patten is going to introduce his reforms into the legislative council   uhm  we are obviously very disappointed with the outcome  the fact that the two sides have uh failed to narrow the gap uh between us on the constitutional issues uh but uh both sides have uh expressed willingness to continue the dialogue because both sides feel that it is in uh their interests to reach an agreement we remain fully convinced that an that an agreement is necessary for hong kong and we will do our best to try and achieve that agreement  but as the foreign secretary has already pointed out we do have practical uh physical constraints in that there are elections coming up in nineteen ninety-four and nineteen ninety-five and we must make sure that legislation is enacted in time for those elections to be conducted so we do not have unlimited time but we have not set a deadline  and we remain uhm committed to trying and to reach agreement that will ensure that hong kong has fair or open uh election arrangements that are acceptable to the people of hong kong   and if no agreement is reached how do you think relations are going to develop with china i mean i think in anybody ' s view they are going to worsen as the future chief secretary how do you think you would like to try to go about mending ties with china once one-word of the relations would have reached into such a gap there will be such a gap in the issue   i ' m not at this stage anticipating failure as i say both sides have said that they would like to reach an agreement because it is clearly in both sides ' interests  uhm if agreement is not reached then the foreign secretary has made clear that the governor would have to put certain proposals before the legislature and members of the legislature will then have to vote on them  i do not think that if in the event that that happens that necessarily indicates that the whole of hong kong will collapse  let us not forget that we have considerable cooperation with uhm china on a wide range of issues practical issues that affect the everyday life of hong kong uhm uhm and those uhm issues the cooperation on those issues uhm   hav have continued are intensifying and i do not see necessarily that we should conclude that they will suddenly come to an end the chinese have after all many occasions reaffirmed their view that they will not do anything to do as it were uh harm the economy of hong kong because hong kong ' s economic prosperity will also benefit china     but can you   but but can you take that at face value though because there are the government has tried now to play down the threat of the sar preparatory committee which is being set up by china
