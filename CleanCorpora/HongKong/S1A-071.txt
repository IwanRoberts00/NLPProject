 uhm 
yeah
phantom of the opera really uhm is very popular
over there
but but they seldom go to hong kong to show 
but the phantom is maybe uh is is coming in uh

how long here it for 
uhm

three or four months 
yeah
 
oh really 
uhm
which still playing at our places

how much
 
for like student they say fifty dollars which is cheapest ticket
oh the cheapest ticket

fifty
 
yeah
oh for miss saigon 
yeah
 
no miss saigon and les mis 
there ' s lots of prices
the most expensive
oh what the most expensive is
if you ' re right in front of the orchestra

i think a hundred and something
 
but it ' s not too bad 
uhm
 
you can get really good seat for like seventy fifty 
 the more or less the same of hong kong

oh really 
yup
yeah
 
but phantom is really expensive 
you 
we don't have student tickets
 
yeah 
 for phantom 
 
yeah yeah
we don't have student tickets over there either
but fifty dollars is usually
or they say is the student price 
uh
 
 because it ' s just the cheapest one 
 is it 
isn't it bad
 
yeah
it ' s really bad seat 
i may several words 
 
what else do they have for broadway 
uhm 
no
 
ha
just phantom 
i haven't seen phantom because i i just bought the ticket
 
 uh 
 waiting for july
 
oh they visit july

yeah
i really like the broadway music

oh 
oh
 
i haven't seen that
have you seen that 
yeah

yeah
i haven't see that
our school do that but i don't see it 
uhm uhm
 
cat
i think i saw but 
i was surely uhm that was really uhm
have you seen cat 
 uhm 
no
 
no
yeah
i don't i don't think i don't think everyone like cat
but les mis is really good 
do you know any musical instrument
 
uhm 
piano
 
yeah 
piano
 
and flute and saxophone 
 flute 
is still learning now or
 
yeah 
yeah at school 
school like band something like that 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
is it uh difficult to do to learn saxophone
 although 
 
 no 
saxophone is really easy 
yeah 
it ' s really easy
that all i ' ve seen i ' ve seen it probably easier because i play
piano 
so it ' s easier
for the flute is a bit harder if he also just 
two words 
 really easy 
 uhm 
 saxophone and piano
 
yeah because i know the notes 
so it ' s really easy for me to remember
but for flute it ' s sort of different things
you have to in horrible and everything 
 oh 
that ' s what ' s you used kind of born
first time you guard
 
uhm uhm 
did you learn it in high school when you go to high school
or did you do music programme
 
uhm 
how long have you been learning piano
 
piano
uhm
for like the 
no no the more than the 
ten ten years 
ten years
 
yeah 
so if you reached a certain grade one word
 
 
 i several words primary six
yeah i ' ve been grade ten 
uhm
 
yeah
so several words 
i i haven't learn that 
it ' s grade ten
 
yeah it ' s grade ten 
i thought after grade eight to speeches of the first
unidentified speaker 
 
no he here they have grade eight
but over there they have grade ten 
and then we have alct where you get your teacher ' s performance
license 
so you can teach
after grade eight over there you can teach already 
but then if you get your uhm alct
you ' ll be a professional teacher 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
oh
are you teaching any student
 
yeah i ' m teaching students
uhm i own alct
teaching and looking 
uhm uhm
uh ha
i ' ve learn piano for seven years
i stop for six years
 
oh really
still play 
seldom
 
seldom 
uhm
 
what grade did you
did you learn over here 
yeah yeah
 
uh what grade did you get to 
six
grade six
 
yeah
that ' s a grade eight over there i think 
it ' s seven or eight over there 
 uhm 
oh it ' s diff it ' s different 
 
 yeah it ' s different
cause you only have to grade eight here
so grade eight over here is a kind like grade ten over there 
uh uh
 
kind of
so
in between grade nine and ten like that 
so they just have lots of grade one-word 
 uhm 
uhm
 
that ' s all 
have you seen once upon a time in america
have you heard of that movie
 
i i think i ' ve heard of it
i think i ' ve heard of it
i don't know 
it sounds familiar but i remember
isn't a movie 
isn't an old movie 
 uhm 
 yeah 
yeah quite old
 
quite old
who ' s in it 
uhm robert de niro two words 
 
oh really 
yeah
 
no 
i like him
 
oh really
yeah
have you seen frankenstein 
no
 several words 
 
 do they two words yet 
no
 
no oh okay
cause i have several words 
uhm
 several words 
uhm
oh have you seen kidbear 
no
 
no
 oh it ' s really good
you should see it
 it ' s really 
 yes 
 yes 
i i don't really like the uhm thriller
 
which one 
uhm i like mystery
but i i found go if going to the cinema and 
sitting there for two hours and keep scaring 
 laughs 
 
 uh 
 uh 
yeah
oh i i
oh yeah mysteries was pretty scary 
yeah
 
yeah
i 
and keep fill too
it ' s quite violence
 
 keep fair 
yeah
i think so 
 laughs 
i like it
also you haven't seen it 
no
 
oh 
right
 
uhm have you seen 
what else
have you seen sandra waltman he said in love

 only three cities
 there ' s loven 
but uhm it ' s quite dirty and noisy
but it is very
uh it ' s different from the other part of europe like uhm
paris and amsterdam
because maybe it ' s due to it has long history
there are many monuments and museums all the paintings and 
 
i love venice too
 it ' s clean for 
and
no it ' s not as clean as uhm germany and paris
it ' s because the northern part is

 oh 
 uh ha 
lots of people 
yes
 and

uhm uhm
i ' ve never been to those parts
 so they don't have one-word 
let me see if you 
 uhm 
but i haven't been to britain and uh
 
 uh 
portugal and spain
 
uhm uhm uhm
are you gonna to go 
yeah
 
hopeful hopefully 
yeah
but the coming
in the coming summer holiday i have to find a job 
 
if uhm there ' s a offer i ' ll i ' ll go
 somewh somewhere else
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
oh really 
uhm
 
for the summer 
yes
 
oh okay 
uh
the the the trip lasts for fifty days 
for a europe europe trip
 
 uhm uhm 
fifty days 
fifty days
 
wah so two words 
 two words 
yeah
 
oh really 
 many people go to europe in the summer 
 
but your sister said that that ' s not so common in canada for
a student to travel a lot during their holiday
 
 uhm uhm 
yeah not travel like that
usually they they go out exchange trips 
so they go therefore uhm for school something like that
like they go out and change someone
and they get a credit
 but they usually don't go out family and travel
or even by themselves 
even university i don't know those
those high school you know 
yeah some of my friends went on uhm exchange trips or
scholarship to france or something
they go for maybe two weeks or something
they exchange you while you exchange with students over there
 
and then you stay there
and you have to speak the language and go to school not
language
and you get the credit
so 
 uhm 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
do you do french
 
yeah yeah several words 
i don't like it
i really bad at it 
so only the university student uhm can have the exchange
programme or
 
no high school student
yeah 
 high school student
uhm uhm 
 
even actually some elementary schools have
it
only some of 
 uhm uhm 
 how long do the programme last
 
uh if you go you go for the whole summer 
the whole summer
 
yeah
and then you exchange for another family
so they take care of you
and your family takes care of the other student 
have you applied for
 
no 
 laughs 
so i think
so
uhm
 
but then it ' s actually pretty good
cause you 
you aren't pay too much
cause i several words taking care of 
 
because you used to with family and used to go to school
so it sounds too bad
but yeah 
 uhm 
but i like meeting people in that places
 in different places
 
 yeah 
uhm uhm 
 yes 
 
 yeah 
what ' s fun
in europe i i talk to different people on trains on the
hostels who meet
 just meet different people
uhm 
when you see some someone on on the backpack 
you ' ll just feel more friendly to help them
and go to there 
students from all over the world and many
from states
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 yeah 
yeah 
yeah that ' s right
 
do you know people over there like people from the states
like do they like them
because i don't want to say that people in europe don't like
something like people from 
 yeah 
 
i don't know though
did you notice that when you went there 
but people in europe don't like uh students from hong
kong too
 because they are just too noisy
 
 yeah 
oh really
do they like people from canada 
no
 
no
 what do they like 
 laughs 
 i haven't 
 laughs 
but many people don't like the students from the states
 
uh ha
yeah
yeah a lot of people when uhm they go
then they go out places they
and they have some like a stick
they never bring with a speed
 the fatal or one-word 
they anything that and has supplied 
 uhm 
 and i don't know why
 
yeah
it ' s supposed they don't like them one another either 
uhm
yeah
do you uhm do you find this racial discrimination in canada
 
uhm sometimes 
it ' s not too bad sometimes there ' s are there can be
