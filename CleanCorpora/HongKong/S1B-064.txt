mr loong can you look at page five to page eight of the
plaintiff  ' s bundle

before you signed this document on page six as you said in your
evidence in chief can you recall on how many occasions had you discussed
these contract with the plaintiff  recording fast-forwards 
 
""
about two times 
""
""
on those two occasions did you talk to the plaintiff  ' s
representative in person or over the phone  cantonese translation  
recording fast-forwards 
 
""
monthly uh meeting of the management committee we discussed these
matter 
""
""
and on uh those two occasion apart from mr allen wong did
anyone else represent the plaintiff  cantonese translation  
recording fast-forwards

 two words  
""

and on your side on the side of the management committee apart
from you can you recall who were present on those two occasion  recording
fast-forwards 
 
""
lee wung tong the secretary and some other committee members 
""
""
would it be correct to say that what were discussed on those
two occasion were fully reflected in this documents now in front of you
namely from page five to page eight  recording fast-forwards 
""
""
your honour perhaps i can rephrase that
 
""
well you see  three words  therefore is
difficult to answer questions begin would it be correct so as to say 
""
""
perhaps i can rephrase that your honour
""
now mr   loong 
 
""
 if   i wonder ask you on that recall the  a
few words  
""
""
i will try to do that step   by step 
 
""
  one-word    you know is a very
vague expression rather than than  a few words  a complete
or correct  one word  
""
""
i take your point your honour i can rephrase that
 
""
yes 
""
""
is it correct that after the two discussion you mentioned you
and the plaintiff sorry the management committee and the plaintiff company
arrived at an agreement  recording fast-forwards 
 
""
yes 
""
""
and the agreement was as state in the document on page five to
page eight
 
""
sorry agreement   recording fast-forwards 
""
""
is stated in the document at page five to page eight 
cantonese translation </o.
 recording fast-forwards 
 
""
yes   a long pause 
""
""
in other words there was nothing which was agreed between 
 you 
 
""
 uh  
""
sorry 
""
""
there was nothing agreed between the management committee and
the plaintiff after the two discussion you refer to which was not state in
this document
""
""
your honour it  ' s very complicated question
 
""
i know  a few words  that one too 
""
""
well your honour perhaps i can rephrase that
 
""
you have to rephrase that it  ' s true it was hard to understand
""
""
""
yeah my apology for that your honour
""
there was nothing which the plaintiff company and the management
committee of central mansion agreed on those two occasion which were not
reflected oh which were state in this particular document
 
""
are you asking whether anything which they agreed  two
words  the document 
""
""
yes
 
""
well that  ' s  a few words 
""
was   there anything  which you and the plaintiff had
agreed left out or  three words  
""
""
 i can rephrase your honour    cantonese
translation   recording fast-forwards 
 
""
uhm will uh the   cantonese translation and answer 
 
""
well mainly it it contains what has been agreed 
""
""
well in that case can you tell us what had been left out in
that document  cantonese translation   recording fast-forwards 
 
""
uh items left out such as uh something occurred in case of
emergency and when the plaintiff  ' s company found it necessary to add into
the agreement 
 
""
to what 
 
""
to add into the agreement 
 
""
yeah 
 
""
the plaintiff  ' s company would make suggestion to the management
to the management committee

and after discussion among members of the committee will be
decided whether to add in the into the agreement or not

 two words  
""
""
yes indeed  recording fast-forwards 
  remember the date of  one word

where is that

 recording
fast-forwards 
 
""
yes correct 
 
""
is that correct   cantonese translation   recording
fast-forwards 
 
""
yes correct 
 
""
now what i want to know has anything if you would agree there are
the date  a few words  that document probably you signed
the document were left out from the document 
 
""
don't remember 
 
""
 a few words    cantonese translation
""
 
""
yes covered everything we agreed 
 
""
thank you 
""
""
 mis  mr loong can you recall on those two occasion was
there any discussion in relation to the compensation payable to the plaintiff
company if the plaintiff were to be dismissed from their service 
cantonese translation   recording fast-forwards 
 
""
it is already stated in the contract here 
""
""
which part are you
 
""
sorry   cantonese translation and answer 
 
""
well since it is not written in the contract that we have to pay
compensation if we dismiss their service that means we don't have to pay any
compensation 
""
""
on those two occasion did you expressly discuss these  i
 sorry your understanding with mr wong of the plaintiff
 
""
sorry what was it 
""
""
on those two occasions
 
""
yes 
""
""
did he ever discuss his understanding which he just mentioned
 with mr wong
 
""
was the question of compensation ever  a few words
   cantonese translation </o.
 recording
fast-forwards 
 
""
no it was not discussed at all 
""
""
now uh mr wong moving to another topic the two hundred for
cleaning the bottom of the lift shaft can you recall when was that
arrangement made between management committee and the plaintiff
 
""
i believe it was some time after the signing of this contract 
""
""
was it one or two months thereafter or one year thereafter or
what  recording fast-forwards 
 
""
that i don't remember 
""
""
the sum of two hundred was it to be payable every month
whether or not there was actual cleaning work done by the plaintiff
 
""
yes   cantonese translation </o.
 recording
fast-forwards 
""
""
has there been any agreement between the management committee
and the plaintiff  as to when the plaintiff would clean the bottom of the
lift shaft or it was entirely at discussion of the plaintiff
 
""
uh sorry uhm 
""
""
was there any agreement between the management committee 
 and 
 
""
 when  
""
well then  a few words  
""
""
yes or whether it was at the discussion of the plaintiff 
cantonese translation </o.
 recording fast-forwards 
""
""
go to the   bottom 
 
""
 i can   see what he has to say i think i  ' m  
recording fast-forwards 
 
""
once a month 
""
""
  but 
 
""
 you  ' ll   need someone to raise the lift 
""
""
yes it mr wong  ' s evidence earlier that
 
""
yeah 
""
""
uh they required this system of the lift company and it was
when the lift company  ' s  they go and  inform them that there were
rattles at the bottom of the lift shaft that they will clean it up
 
""
yes 
""
""
with assistance of the lift company
 
""
well but 
""
""
but somehow this witness evidence is slightly different in the
way that he said earlier that the two hundred is payable whether or not such
cleaning work were in fact done
 
""
well   recording fast-forwards 
""
""
yeah i i entirely take uh your honour  ' s point but i think i  ' ve
got what i want from the witness
""
and this witness has just mentioned that the two hundred was ought
to be done or the cleaning work was to be done once a month
 
""
 a few words  you  ' ve done   recording
fast-forwards 
""
""
hasn't add that rider into this last answer
 
""
that is part of his evidence
""
thirty eight two hundred dollars payable whether or not to have
this cleaned 
""
""
yes
 
""
right
""
when it  ' s done if it is done at all being   same  
""
""
 once   a month
 
""
once a month when the  two words   
recording fast-forwards 
""
""
anyway i  ' ve got the answer i want so i don't think i need to
pursue any further along this line
""
mr wong talking about the eight hundred for cleaning the drainage
which you mentioned earlier this morning  cantonese translation </o.
 recording fast-forwards 
""
""
which one
""
""
the one with  chat gei   name of a shop
 and the one in the courtyard which uh my learned friend had shown you
the document this morning  recording fast-forwards 
""
""
can you clarify by telling us whether that eight hundred was
por was for each drainage pipe  or for more than one drainage pipe 
recording fast-forwards 
 
""
one pipe 
""
""
can you tell us altogether how many pipes were there that
would require such cleaning or clearing up at central mansion  cantonese
translation </o.
 recording fast-forwards 
 
""
to my knowledge at least three uh the three you can find in the
document   a long pause 
""
""
your honour can i have one moment indulgence i just want to
check this uh
""
is it correct that the arrangement in relation to these three
drainage pipes were that every month you have to pay or the management
committee have to pay eight hundred for each pipe no matter whether any
cleaning work was done in relation to the pipes that have questions
 
""
so that meant you have to pay two thousand four hundred dollars
each month for clearing these three pipe so that  two words
 is that the case   recording fast-forwards 
 
""
yes 
""
""
in relation to this arrangement who represent the plaintiff
in arriving at the  ma  at at this arrangement with managing committee
 cantonese translation </o.
 recording fast-forwards 
 
""
i don't remember   a long pause > 
""
""
the problem with these three pipes were you aware of them i
mean uh lord these problems when you discussed the management contract with
the plaintiff back in june nineteen eighty nine
 
""
yes 
""
""
so what  ' s  what was the reason that the cleaning of these
three pipes was not included in the management contract
 
""
wasn't these three pipes 
""
""
the cleaning of these three pipes
 
""
what was the reason 
""
""
why
 
""
cleaning 
""
""
of these three pipes was not included in the management
contract  cantonese translation   recording fast-forwards 
 
""
it was because at that time the plaintiff  ' s company had to hire
somebody to clean the pipe 
""
""
uhm mr loong can you turn to page seven of the plaintiff  ' s
bundle
""
your honour the translation on page three  cantonese
translation </o.
 recording fast-forwards 
""
""
number two cleaning fee  f  six thousand   ' six
thousand  '  overlap  ' daih yih hohng ' -'the second line '   cantonese
translation 
""
""
the plaintiff company also engaged someone to perform this
cleaning duty did they not  cantonese translation </o.
 recording
fast-forwards 
 
""
yes 
""
""
well that was included in the contract so why wasn't the
cleaning of the three pipes in question not included
 
""
because   cantonese answer 
 
""
it was because there was no fixed cost for the cleaning of a pipe
at that time 
""
""
why was that not done on reimbursement basis then
 
""
that was the initial practice that is they issued us a bill of
eight hundred dollars and we paid them eight hundred dollars  
cantonese translation   recording fast-forwards 
""
""
uh mr loong turning to the five thousand claimed by the
plaintiff for the work they for the preparation work they have done in
relation to the renovation of the building  cantonese translation  
recording fast-forwards 
""
""
that is in relation to page eighty five of the plaintiff  ' s
bundle if you want to flip back your bundle  recording fast-forwards 
""
""
on what basis that the management committee agreed with this
sum of five thousand suggested by the plaintiff
 <  
""
unclear> a few sentences  
""
""
the   plaintiff 
 
""
 plaintiff  
""
i understood  a few words  step by step 
""
""
well your honour i think the evidence so far is that that
amount had been suggested and that that was being discussed   by the
""
 
""
 sorry   
""
""
the evidence so far is that that amount was being put forward
by the plaintiff it was then discussed by the   management committee
""
 
""
 but can   you remember i  a few words
 again i want to be absolutely something clear about this 
""
""
yes
 
""
as i understand first of all the plaintiff has decided that they
want to renovate 
""
""
yes
 
""
all right so they asked the plaintiff to do some private work
""
""
""
yes
 
""
nothing was said at that time about payment 
""
""
yes
 
""
all right 
""
""
it was then subsequently suggested by someone that what
happened if the work was not done
 
""
well well
""
then later on after work is done somebody said what happens if we
don't go ahead with the renovation 
""
""
indeed
 
""
which is perfectly understandable  a few sentences
 
""
""
indeed
 
""
right so if you you expect that  a few words 
the price later on 
""
""
indeed
 
""
okay so when that questions  one-word  raised
""
""
""
someone suggested five   to six thousand 
 
""
 but the  
""
the plaintiff suggested five to six thousand dollars 
""
""
yes
 
""
and have no agreement  two words  at that
dates 
""
""
yes
""
""
""
""
when they decided to abandon the object the plaintiff put in the
bill the five thousand 
""
""
yes
 
""
it is then approved by the committee 
""
""
yes
 
""
that  ' s the bases  two-words  mr yuen 
""
""
uh your honour that is the chronology of how the matters 
 happen 
 
""
 but   for the case i don't think there will be a
problem  a few words  unless by that you mean something
entirely different 
""
""
your honour what i wish to ascertain from the witness is the
reason why they agreed with the sum of five thousand
 
""
does it matter or may be yes they did agree 
""
""
well because that would be in relation to the claim of
quantum meruit
 
""
wouldn't that be settled by the  two-words 
""
""
""
if that bit of   evidence 
 
""
 that is a   classic example of an agreement be
breached after what consideration being fixed after the 
""
""
agreement is   as they 
 
""
 benefit of doubt   on the basis all alone  a
few words  to pay for what they have to say  a few words
 that is the quantum meriut
""
it  ' s not as if if this bill have been this evidence have been
well we never decide which figure were out even though they out in the bill
without the figure we never decide it never approve then you would have to go
go into the value of  a few words  if i accept what he
said 
""
""
well yes if if your honour accept what he said
 
""
but you are not you seem to go behind that valuation 
""
""
uh what the reason why i  ' m trying to do that is because at
this stage i cannot say for sure whether your honour would accept that that
was in fact agreed between the parties so if you at the end of the day your
honour does not make that ruling then it would be relevant to see whether
that five thousand is worth
 
""
all right okay 
""
""
 s  uhm mr loong can you tell us the reason why the
management committee agree with the figure of five thousand put forward by
the plaintiff  cantonese translation   recording fast-forwards 
 
""
that  ' s because uh at the initial stage 
 
""
sorry at 
 
""
at the initial stage 
 
""
thank you 
 
""
they called for  tenants  for us they out advertisement in
the newspaper and they showed the potential uh  tenants   tenants
 that is the uhm something that the   contractors  to look at
the uh damaged areas
""
but they they had done various things for us 
 
""
 yeah     cantonese answer 
 
""
that  ' s why they requested for a few thousand dollars as their
travelling expenses 
""
""
now the new committee was elected on the seventh of september
nineteen ninety can you by reference to that tell us
 
""
sorry elected on what day 
""

the plan to renovate central mansion dropped  cantonese translation

was the sum of five thousand put forward by the plaintiff  cantonese
translation   recording fast-forwards

 well that  ' s   what he  ' s already told us this
morning 
""

yes i i  ' m not talking about the stage when the five to six
thousand was mentioned

well then you should be more precise as to what stage you  ' re 
 talking

 that  ' s   why i  ' m i  ' m trying to clarify  
with this witness

 what  one word    you really want
to get from  two words  when did the committee approve the
figure five thousand

few words  a and mr pow had not covered  a few words

 if   your suggestion that seemed to be wrong
 a few words  but what  ' s the point  a few words

clarified with this witness the sequence of event what i  ' m trying now to do
is to put that sequence within the time frame ie the month   of 
the year

what i  ' m suggesting is perhaps the question  a few
words  when the committee approved the figure five thousand

well i can do that right now your honour

well that  ' s what i  ' m suggesting  a few words
