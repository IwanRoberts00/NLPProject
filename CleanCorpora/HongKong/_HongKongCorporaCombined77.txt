okay that ' s it that ' s recording  go ahead   okay uh he ask me if i have any special questions i ' ve only read the document that ' s required by university i ' m just simply want to have a natural conservation  so since you and i we know each other well we would have you know cost a benefit a natural conversation   alright  okay but what if the after what did they want to know     uhm  what did they are i i think the idea is to criticize what sort of accent have the people would study in hong kong and according to sarah level of studies except house fair with its english now i two-words extraordinary kids let ' s see the two-words your english but no  coz it i want to explain to me some since because tut  the other day you were explaining me some one-word on the telephone about your new office in canton and i wanted you to uh explain to me you know the setting up what does the reaction of the people nothing personal and you use a number of chinese metaphor expression  i like you to explain some to   okay   woo right you ' re firing me five six questions at the time but  let me tell you something about my english okay uhm i haven't to process a musical year and as a result uh it probably helps me in differentiating between accents it helps me in differentiating between english spoken by different people like yourself being french like uh my schoolmates at school being hong kong chinese like my english teachers  i think you know well one was american with an american accent uhm another one was a i i never had an english english teacher i mean from england that is no no that is  from england or anything  but the i think i was lucky enough for the school i went all the classes i ' ve been to the english teachers are the ch you know who who themselves were chinese spoke did not speak with a hong kong accent  which means you you know i could differentiate but it was it wasn't improper it wasn't really proper and noth nothing nothing english about it or american about it or any they     yeah   laughs   two-words yeah   yeah   uhm uhm   oh really  but it was a good english good quality english  it was fair it was decent that wasn't extraordinary and and and then i pick up and my sisters i i i of course i had had the benefit of having uh i mean being brother with the fam in a family uhm the well educated family i four sisters all of them went to decent schools  uhm my uh my elder sister is uhm what did she anyway a doctor and     uhm uhm   is it phd in philosophy  alright she ' s a phd in philosophy i have a another yeah okay i have another another sister who was a phd my uh uh one sister who ' s very sporty but she she her english is  well no no no she isn't i mean she ' s okay she ' s one-word but she was actually in australia she didn't have australian accent i think she would she didn't have too much of uh hong kong you know what uh what i mean that kind of accent    two-words scissor   laughs   just one-word alright   uh uh  yeah uhm   laughs  uhm  he ' s very nice source whatever you like you know my and and uhm actually my all my four sisters they speak decent english i would say some uh the you know some of them are really educated in an you know eng english  literature philosophy well read people et cetera  but they left hong kong when i was pretty young  and wouldn't speak english at home cantonese was spoken at home my mother spoke uh well speaks still broken english my father as well but they their accents were not bad    nice   uhm uhm   uhm   three words uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uh  yeah and that ' s uh for for her generation your mum speak pretty good english and two-words  i mean after all i speak themselves often uhm  well she no she doesn't speak good english she her her com would command and vocabulary and and her choice of words would definitely uhm lacking   but the accent is not tone like cantonese   she hardly speaks english now  she she she ' s quite elderly    uhm uhm  uhm  and uhm what and and then and then i had school i i was uh i went i went uh i ' ve spent the first three years with a my primary school  up to primary three in st. stephen college i   was good in english  i remember the very very good in even well in dictation you know it how to spell a word et cetera et cetera  being a girl ' s school i could only  i think i could only study until pri primary four or whatever i then change school i spent one year in raimondi college and then and st. paul ' s college  uh st. paul ' s college did not give me much uhm     uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   but you had the good interaction    uh despite the fact that it was regarded as a very good school   laughs  i didn't uh somehow on rich respection i i i cannot agree to that   laughs    would everyone speak well would everyone  speak well two-words   uh he never taught me anyway   oh i see   he never taught me i had a good influence with an american teacher emerson  he was good  but by then you know uhm my my my vocabulary my accent was was  i i think already deeply how do you say it deeply set    yeah uhm  yes form   form     uhm uhm uhm  of course i knew you at that time  i didn't catch you i didn't catch up with your french accent uh  your words not mine    uhm   uhm   one-word   laughs  yeah several words   zero too  i had i had her godfather but then it was quite late i was into my teen already at that time that i became close to my now godfather  i mean he ' s very close with our family but i never had the opportunity to be close to an end  it was very late you know the in my teens that time he became my godfather really because we were ne never really actually officially    i don't know how it call one-word   no you don't use this word no well you don't    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm yes yes yes one-word  uhm and and and the well up to that in your one-word of life uh did you have a if you can think one now and of course  did you have difficulty when you recruit people how ' s the quality of their english do you demanding   i give up   you give up  well i mean  okay i never had a university education  i uhm the the highest i go to was supper six the equivalent the equivalent of forms of form seven now    yeah   uhm  uhm uhm   tut but i don't think any uh your friend who have a here maybe who ' s doing this who ' s conducting this research   he can really take he can really take me as a as a normal of part of you know i i won't merged in very well with this statistics  i never never never read english literature i never read shakespeare or anything i never uhm play particular attention to to english grammar although i myself uh i ' m quite discipline about pronouncing words  you remember i even corrected you many uh time  about your pronunciation    research yeah   yeah   yes   yes without question you said   yes  that ' s true uhm uhm uhm   uh you or or or even your eng uh your your grammar for that matter you would say one one of those uh i can't remember  three words  one of those thing without the s or something like that you know    one of the thing i always forget s   yeah that ' s right  it ' s uh it ' s my big mistake i make it all the time uhm uhm   so that ' s it may maybe your friend is wasting his time if he ' s listening  he will be listening to this tape of course     no no no no   no no he isn't wasting his time anyway we ' ll we ' ll do it uh then we know about your your business and the use of the english and the advantage one-word really roles at your  companies   uh you don't want me to talk about canton anymore   uh yes yes within canton scope of course  the use of english in canton  forget it     yeah why not  no no within within your business altogether uh it     within my business uh     yeah the use of the english within your business in hong kong and in canton   very in hong kong it ' s very important i deal with the i deal with large corporations i mean i mean finance i mean consumer finance i do high-purchases  uh unlike five six years back still i mean i i  i was in this line we ' ll before that but unlike five six five six years back when you could still you know uh get around without much english the uhm without much english in my field rather the uhm the mode of operation the uhm the the the uh the way to survive and beat your competition is is  it changes when the market does and the market changes in in the electrical appliances fields the retailing field in a sense in the sense that uhm the small time has  now gone the large corporation chain stores are in department store take over stores like fortress take over  thalin  and what have you  and if you want to do business you really got to be professional and  i deal i deal i deal i deal with fortress uhm  and at that time and even still now i mean they they  as you know they are under the umbrella of uh hutchison and uh you have got watson ' s immediately above them and then of course they belong to the hutchison group and the of course you know they they pretty professional   in in you know just     uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   but three words they are proposed recent do you have to uh write and your set   no i ' m i ' m just coming to this now    you see in a sense that you know when you deal with uh an organization a bit you know uh chain store and uh you have to you come up with proposal you ' ve come up with good english you know it ' s not really it ' s not good english in a sense of si you know studying english or or or or or or or uh you know because in business business english is never never demanding you just have to be exact and the presentation will have to be proper you have to be in a correct business format uhm forget about the you know details about about the uhm  the requirements of the business  because we ' re not into this now    uhm   later   uhm  uhm uhm  but in that way english is required but i don't think it ' s not demand not demanding at all and i think i think it ' s something that anybody can do this  this the fact that i got these deals uh has nothing to do with well alright it ' s got to do with correct english being used but it ' s not really advanced english that has to be  used to get these deals i mean you need a lot more you know your your tut  every other factors that is necessary to make  the you know the the the deal to to close the deal  now on uh let say on a social level or even if it ' s  if i had to see the people have meeting with them i had the  gwái lóu these cantonese words refer to foreigners speak english i think they appreciate me my englished does help uh but also you know i think it ' s it ' s a again it ' s it ' s just one part of many that is necessary in the entire makeup because see those people don't judge your english but people would know they can tell if your english is no good  uhm and and they would     uhm   yes   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   but you say your your also involve with the uh social one-word of the uh royal jockey club in hong kong et cetera when you have meetings with them is it all are conducted in   english and   oh yes yes yes a hundred percent in english i ' m chairman of the three words  uhm i have uhm tut i have of course people from all many nations uh serving in my committee  uh for instances i ' ve got david davis he ' s english i ' ve got uhm some american i ' ve got uhm i ' ve got i ' ve got one-word  who english uh they serve you know in my uh  well go ahead answer the phone your phone  uh okay you want me to stop    uhm uhm   it ' s it ' s  uh yes yes stop no  uh resume alright i i uh coming back to this committee of mine  uh it ' s a knowledge of the proceedings of meeting uh that is necessary uh more so than the again more so than the quality of english like in in the meeting you have to know how to open it you have know you know the the gender we have to be introduced you ' ve got you have to let the people talk you have to uhm lead them into uh  well oh oh okay allow them to to to add a views and be fair when there ' s an agreement et cetera et cetera i mean these things require a certain uh    yeah   one-word  no no no i or i i i can't find the word you know it ' s uh it ' s a set of it ' s a set of uhm terms and and and and word and jargon of meeting that is necessary     oh yes yes yeah  you know like like well like yeah you want to call a vote and you know those in flavour say a et cetera et cetera you know things like that so that one is that and uhm where did i get that from i never read books about it i just attended other meetings uh i serve uhm you know in other meetings and it ' s conducted by by of course uh there were good chairman and there were not so good chairman  and i just i just pick what i think pick other  better ones  and i i catch on you see  and that ' s all but i was just saying about you know on a uh on the business level when you ' re during a meeting  uhm i think in hong kong it is uh it is an advantage if you have a good command being chinese if you have good command of english tut and if you uh if you can use that to advantage plus the other things that you have you know in the to to make to make uh any meetings successful or any negotiation successful you better off than the man the the other man that ' s for sure  you know when where you when you when you speak with non-chinese    to conduct the meeting and the one-words    yes yes familiarity   uhm and you pick the well   you do it   yeah yeah   uhm uhm uhm  uhm do do you the fact that you know the two languages you know very very well  does one-word she do you do  i mean everybody you do   no   no   no no no   no no i i ' m not modest in anything i ' m not modest i ' m just i ' m just being factual is that ice     but does he does he uh sort of multiply to see  foreign in in the meeting can come out very very differently from from foreigners who are recently meeting and the chinese views in the meeting i mean the fact that just speak good english does it how do you to express in more chinese view  my views are mine i don't know whether they are chinese or english or western or eastern or whatever my views are my views but i had difficulties in expressing my views when i conduct meetings in chinese i i i can't find the terms i ' m not used to used to them  uh now that i ' ve started my office in guangzhou no it ' s true now that i ' ve started my office in guangzhou and  through practice i have improved but it ' s still nothing like uh like my english and day to day i married i have a daughter  uhm it at home we speak well uh uh my wife and i speak cantonese  and because my daughter you know when she was born i don't like hong kong education period i think the schools are noisy i think the schools are bad the teachers are bad and i don't think the universities very good either if you ask me  laughs  now uhm you can laugh but but uhm i want my daughter i don't  i cannot i cannot see the meaning behind having pushing young children to go through hours and hours of meaningless homework every every night when they get back home because the teacher has to you know require them to memorize the words you know english and chinese menu and then they have to they they have to dictate it verbatim    maybe this ' s it ' s wrongly use here  well it ' s wrongly use because it ' s dictation you  know uh in in including including sort of these punctuation marks uh and and and if you just you know error little bit uhm then you don't get the marks and it is and it is amount of homework it ' s it ' s it ' s quite meaningless i think that ' s why i always wanted my daughter to go into international school and being all chinese my family i i i started speaking english to my daughter ever since    uhm   is it one-word   yeah   like your english uhm   yeah   one-word yeah   uhm   no no it ' s one-word   uhm
