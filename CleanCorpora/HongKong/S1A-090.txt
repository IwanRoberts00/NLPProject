<I>
 
it ' s terrible thing to say 
okay
 
okay so what are you going to do this summer 
 laughs 
oh i ' m not sure but uh at this moment i notice that there 
is a field trip to russia yeah 
 
 really
with the with the university 
yeah uhm doctor share of the history department will lead
us to uhm lead uh thirty peoples uh to russia
and they will study in the one-word university
or something like that
 
where ' s that
in moscow 
uh in st. petersburg yeah
 
 st. petersburg 
oh 
so it will be quite nice
but only uh there are only thirty places
so i ' m not sure whether i can get a place or not but uhm
i really want to go there
 
yeah but what what history
what history course is that
is that one on russia or what is it 
no each
actually this is not from uh history department
just uhm the lecture lecturer uh from history department 
 yeah
so actually uhm students of uh from different faculties
can join this trip 
 
 to organize it
oh 
 what are what are you going to do over there 
uh in the morning uh very boring
we need to attend uh lectures uh for several hours
and then in the afternoon uh usually uh according to him
he said that uhm he will uh bring us to visit some museum
 
 uh ha 
alright 
yeah
uhm and according to him and 
 laughs 
 because i don't you know i don't like him
he ' s such a a irresponsible teacher very yeah
 
 okay 
he do 
yeah
in those seminars uh because i have uh attended his course
nineteenth century europe
and usually in the seminars he didn't listen to uh the what
the student uh say
 
uhm uhm 
yeah
he just uh keep keep uh looking at uh his watch
yeah something like that 
yeah so but after you have uh said something
he always uh say uh good good very good
yeah so that ' s terrible
 
 three words 
so how long would you be would you be going to russia if you
 went 
 uh four weeks
 
four weeks
just a bit time
just like a lecture on history one-word
 history one- word 
 uh no 
not only on history but also art uhm culture 
and some on politics i think
 
 uhm 
what about russian
begin to learn russian 
yeah he said that uh the there will be a class uh
teaching us some terms some usual terms uh in russia
 but i think that uh russian is a very difficult
language is it 
 
 oh 
 oh it has different
it has different alphabet so you have
i have some friends who study russian and 
it ' s a whole different alphabet so you have to get that
but as soon as you get the alphabet right
it ' s not too hard to read and
i don't know but it ' s pretty interesting
but there ' s no language in four weeks is only got enough
but and if you ' ve got class in the morning to learn then
it ' s it is enough to get around in the street
is like that 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
uhm
 actually i ' m i think they are not intended
to teach us russian 
they just uh let us know some terms so that we can
uh for example uh
in the railway station we can notice some words and
won't get loss
 
 two-words 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yes 
yes okay
just getting around the in in the countries
it ' s very important to know at least a few words
otherwise if you go into place and you know the language 
yeah
 
so it should be good 
uhm uhm 
 laughs 
and russia uh i don't know
because why i really want to go there because
i think that is rather quite dangerous if i go there by
myself
 i ' m not sure because of its political unrest 
 uh 
 
 oh 
 thinking by yourself because i want to really
know where to go apart from moscow to pe st. petersburg 
 three words 
 laughs 
 i don't know i don't know what is like in the rest
of the country
but it is getting poorer and poorer and all
all the stories you hear about mafia and uh and just
just because it ' s poor
 i even don't know if you would enjoy it by
yourself
and just two-words hard to get along
but if you go people must in your
it ' s organized by someone
then i can be one-word 
do you know other people who want to go with you 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm 
no
 
no 
no
 
uhm 
not a single yeah not sure
cause because uhm i like russian history
uh one-word i want to go there and have a
look
to see how it ' s how it ' s how does it look
 
oh what ' s interesting about russian history
we know it isn't
but what what do you find interest about russian history 
yeah
uhm
i ' m fantasized by the uhm russian revolutionary intelligentsia
 
uh there are there are different uh there were different
uh generations
and they held different idea but uhm they work very hard uhm
 to make uh russia russia better
but uh finally when the revolution uh came
the revolution destroyed them
 
 uhm uhm 
oh yeah 
yeah
i want to i want to study more about uhm the contradiction
within uhm those intelligentsia
and i think if i can go to russia and really have a look uh at
those museums and 
yeah it ' s uh just like bringing me bringing me back to
nineteenth century 
 laughs in
 
but you can 
yeah
 
i think we don't understand what to went there
but then again now the situation has changed very much
i don't know how much is left before those revolutionary
 days 
 uhm 
yeah that ' s true
 
yeah it ' s really sad those in russia at this moment
 i think politically so i have to understood
 anything because uh all speakers laugh 
a bit frightening 
 right 
 me neither 
yeah i ' m a bit worry about the new president
because he ' s a secret police in the past
 
oh yes that ' s right 
yeah that ' s terrible
i uh i afraid that russia will he will became uh become
another stalin 
 laughs 
 three words 
 
 yeah 
yeah
and there was a one-word that he cannot got
elected because of uhm that war with uhm chechnya
is that how you you say it chechnya 
and yeah i thought you you you know this story about how 
the fact that how he got to power raging this force
which is cannot two-words it ' s stupid
i don't know maybe i haven't got the whole version of it
but it doesn't seem like very fair war
he ' s confess that because he want to rage
 that war
 and and like he ' s reading all these reports
about how russia being very successful 
it has a few riot 
actually like it has been continued very very long time 
 
and it ' s loyal to tell a president
okay i ' ve not what i heard is he ' s has been elected just for
that issue 
and now like what he what he he what he ' ll do for the rest of
the economy and russian politics you don't know 
 uhm uhm yeah nya 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
right
actually the people uhm do not much about him
 
uhm uhm 
i think
 
alright 
yeah
 
watches it
 one-word got it 
yeah so 
 and what do you want to do in this summer
holiday
uhm uh it seems you have uhm you told me before that you want
to
this semester is uh will be over uh at the end
of may
 and will you uh stay in hong kong
 
 okay 
 so 
 uhm uhm 
 alright 
uh two-words yeah
uhm by my summer holiday i ' m still still very vague still don't
know what i ' m doing
cause my exam finish end of may
and then i like to go tra to tra i like to
travel around china
but i want to find people to travel to china with
and then i ' m going back to france because i promise my parents
that i go on a holiday with them 
and then i want to go back to uhm continue studying chinese
in taiwan
but i can't yeah i have to find a university that
accept me those
because i ' ve missed over deadlines 
and yes i ' m trying to settle my things at the moment
but it so have to send me out
i don't know they going or not
that ' s two-words i like to do 
 two-words 
 oh 
 oh 
uhm uhm
 
yeah
have you ever been to taiwan 
no
 
no 
no
 
i don't know why i came
i really really want to go there and see what it ' s like
but i heard that there ' s nothing much to see not a great
interest
as to go as a tourist it ' s not much to do 
something yeah 
 yeah no no do 
yeah
because uhm usually most of my friends uhm go there
just for uh eating those uh taiwan food
 
just to go there
oh take a plane have dinner and come back 
yeah because one-word 
no not only just a dinner
but uhm usually they uh stay there for several days 
and they just go there to try those taiwanese
 food yeah 
because uhm i think uh they are not interested
uh me too not interested in those uh na uh park parks
 
 uhm uhm 
 okay 
 yeah 
the parks yeah 
yeah
 
 i ' ve heard it as well like as a tourist
there isn't much to do
would it ' s just a kind of why i i want to go there to study
because it won't be like i ' m visiting 
if i go there to visit then probably i won't very much 
do
but if i go to live for a month or or two months
i like to i can spend two months over there
then i should live there two month
then i can understand how the country works and works
like to live over there 
and i ' ll have enough to do in my spare time without trying
to look for something to see
but yeah as far for eating and i also love all these uh local
coffee places
but you have these taiwanese places we can just have a drink
 there are few in hong kong and few in
china 
i really love these places
i don't know there are so many over there or can just uh 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
but why uh why don't you go to china to study chinese
 
uhm well i i could but well for one thing i as i said that
i really want to go to tai taiwan see 
ones life and i ' ve i ' ve never been
 uh also i ' ve heard that uhm 
one-word it ' s normal difficult to get information about chinese
course in china
especially through the uh internet
and i ' ve heard that the teaching methods are better in taiwan as
in china 
in china they are going to they keep the traditional 
 system which was learn by heart and maybe don't
understand it all
but otherwise i love to go back i want to go back to beijing
like maybe a whole year
because i really really love it even i ' ve been there twice
 but i really really love that city
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh 
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uh

you ' ve never been there either 
 yeah i ' ve never been to china
never
 
never to china at all 
never
 
but you ' re all in china
 sorry

but i ' ve never uh been to other parts of china except hong 
 kong 
 
 yeah yeah i know i know don't worry
 like hong kong is in china
hong kong is several words 
uhm you ' ve never been to mainland china 
why 
 uhm 
 yeah okay 
 no uh 
because uhm uh i think several years ago i uh really wanted to
go to china to have a look
but i can't uh get those travel documents
because i was not uh born in hong kong
yeah and i don't 
 
 where were 
where were you born

yeah
and then i went to france for two years and then 
 one-word 
 
 yeah

 yeah 
yeah because my uh aunt uh and uncles uh lives in france
yeah
 
really

just several months and you were like born in that
period 
 yeah 
yeah
 
and you one-word lived there 
yeah
 
did you go back afterwards 
 no i don't know much about that 
country 
 yeah 
 
 no 
 yeah 
 and do you remember anything from france cause
you were so young
you probably don't 
 no 
no
 
yeah one-word 
yeah but i can uh look at those pictures all speakers
laugh 
so nice 
 
 very good
yeah
 but where where were you in france paris
 near paris paris itself 
 yeah 
 paris 
yeah
 and a small city uh or town
it ' s small town near paris as well
 because uhm uhm my parents didn't stay with my
aunt and uncle
 they uh live with uh a french family 
 family 
 yeah 
 
 oh 
 yeah 
 uh ha 
 oh 
 but you live with your aunt and uncle and they
were living with the 
no
uhm there are two places
they go here and there
 
oh okay okay
oh and then afterwards only afterwards you went to hong kong 
 came to hong kong 
 yeah 
yeah just before my uh younger brother was born
 uh once again uh my younger brother is uh was
supposed to be born in france
but at the last moment my father uh changed his mind
he said that it would be better to stay in hong kong
so the whole family uhm moved to hong kong
 
 oh yeah 
 hong kong 
so you were three when you came here 
yeah
 
so yeah
so you only went to school in hong kong
you didn't go
did you go to school in france probably not 
alright two-words 
 no no 
 yeah so it will be so great if i really stay in
france 
 laughs 
 two-words now i will be uh talking french 
all speakers laugh 
 
 oh 
 one-word you think about that
but yeah it funny how you could be just little difference and
then your whole life would changes 
yeah
 
uhm
 then one-word you may
have told me that have you been to france few times
 two-words once
 when 
 uhm 
 just once 
 yeah 
uhm when is it
five years ago
 
five years ago and how long 
 yeah 
for a month only
 
a month 
yeah because that is the summer holiday after i ' ve taken
those uh the certificate examination
 
uhm uhm 
yeah
 
oh yeah yeah
okay that yeah
i think it ' s okay 
so what did you do when you went paris 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
 you were staying in paris with your aunt and uncle
for a month 
uhm not for a month with them
actually uh i traveled around uh to other places
as well yeah
 and we went to belgium because uhm yeah
in the past uhm when we stayed in france uh we lived with a french
family
and the son of that family uh work uh work si 
 in france uh belgium 
yeah so we went there to see him
yeah he ' s two-words 
 
 oh 
 okay 
 uhm 
 belgium 
 oh 
 oh i ' ve never been to belgium all speakers
laugh 
see like uh like what you ' ve been to china but
have never 
i ' ve never been to belgium i don't 
 one-word you you 
 yeah 
so you you travel a long way uhm from france to china
but not going to belgium to have a look 
 
 yeah 
you know belgium sounds too boring 
yeah nothing to 
 
 one-word it ' s too close i
don't yeah i don't
i ' ve friend who lived there two years and one year uh two years
and for this like one-word seem not much
to do
people live there but that ' s it 
yeah yeah
so i can't apply for the normal traveling documents to china
and i don't want to apply for a visa to go to china
you know that seem quite ridiculous
it means that i ' m not chinese so something like that 
so 
 
 then what what uhm papers you have now
 you have a you have hong kong id card and 
 uh 
 because 
 yeah but uh we need to uh have a travelling
documents
i don't know the term of it but it it is uh designed for those
who was born in hong kong and yeah and live in hong 
kong 
so but now i don't know whether i can apply it uh for that
travelling document or not
but at that time i couldn't apply for it
so uhm i just give it up
 
 okay 
 oh 
yes one-word 
yeah there ' s something i heard that was like for 
we buy a visa to go to hong to china
it ' s maybe my visa but any kind of visa particularly
so for americans americans pay more i don't know why
 but they love it
 yeah americans pay more for the visa to go 
 china 
 how 
 uh 
 so strange
 
so sunny just like hahaha 
 laughs 
uhm that ' s mean maybe mean
yeah for us it likes a hundred a hundred to go there
 and i ' ve heard that for chinese people to come to
hong kong which is supposed to be china
it ' s a thousand dollar 
 uh ha 
uhm
 
as it like especially for chinese people that ' s an incredible a
lot of money
 it stops people people from coming in but so
strange
cause it ' s supposed to be the same country 
 yeah 
 so much strange i don't know that there are
different prices for different people
 yeah 
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
well one-word from hong kong to china yeah
like
it ' s normal because you you want hong kong people to travel to
china and spend money in chi in the rest of china 
and then you afraid that people from mainland china will come to
hong kong and stay there 
but uh i ' ve got some friends uhm or friends of friends in china
who who had been travelling all over the places in china
anybody want to come to hong kong
but at that prices absolutely impossible
 he just want to visit that is but yeah 
 two-words 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uh 
uhm it ' s difficult to imagine
uh maybe uh those american all speakers laugh always uh
bully chin chinese
 
china try to get back at that
well then you had to had to pay the visa for more 
so that uhm i also want to go china except uh especially to
beijing to have a look
 
yeah 
yeah you know some many people go there
and they say that uh beijing is excellent uh 
yeah
 
 yeah 
oh that ' s one point of view but there ' s so much to see in
over there
like culture and museums and the palaces and 
 yeah palaces
 
and it ' s beautiful and also just
i feel just like a one-word 
when i went there in february compared to hong kong
it ' s so much more laid back and people walks slowly on the
street
 and it has benches and you can sit down
and and i also shocked by many beijing people started talking
to me in chinese and trying to figure out if i can say something or not
and have a conservation which last for two seconds but
for during these two seconds i ' m happy
so really they ' re really nice
as soon as you are tourist of chinese
they really nice to you 
 uh 
 okay 
oh
 
so i like that uh 
if you can't uh find uh friends uh to go to china
with you
what will you do
 
uhm oh yeah i don't know because
if i also find like a tuition jobs here in hong kong
then maybe it ' s a good idea for me to earn a little money that
way
but i think i think uh i know a few people go out into china
so it ' s kind of depends on who out to 
join up with
and if they want me or not i always the one-word
 it ' s so sad nobody nobody has definite plans
 nobody know where we ' re going
but i do know people who are travelling some hoping for tour you
are right
uh it uh like it ' s so one-word my summer
plan
 i don't know what ' s happening if that fails 
 oh 
 okay 
 okay 
 uhm 
 uhm 
so you are now living in lee hysan
 
yeah lee hysan 
 yeah but when will your residential uh
right one-word 
 
 yeah uh we ' ve got 
yeah we ' ve got the room until the twelve of june 
oh
 
yeah so that ' s something and my 
 one-word end of may
so i don't know yet if i ' m waiting till the end of uh middle
of june to go or from go right up after my exams 
 and also depends on other people
so i can see around the view i like hong kong so
i just i don't know there ' s still places i haven't visited or
pictures i have to take
or i want to take everything of picture before i go back cause
otherwise this is my last chance don't you otherwise 
 okay 
 uh 
 two-words 
 okay 
do you like taking pictures
 
actually before this year i hardly ever did
and now uh now in hong kong it ' s very cheap to develop photos in
 hong kong 
and it ' s like so easy cause when i at one-word
 i have to take the car and i go to the shopping center which
is like ten minutes away by car to get my photos develop
then you have to go one-word the next week
 yeah so 
oh
 
but because uh i go to go to the cheaper the cheapest place
around my my home
and here ' s like you go to the university or you go to the
seven-eleven or you go like
because i also out one- word about as well
you go to stanley street you have a good deal on stan 
stanley street
and then finished in an hour and they have your photos and it ' s
very cheap
and also just the fact because i ' m here where it ' so so special
and i ' ve brought a new camera which has a zoom
so i ' m really proud of new camera which has a zoom
and i like play with it all the time
so taking more and more pictures
it ' s going bad bad habit 
no it ' s good yeah
but i ' ve never uhm taking any pictures here 
one-word 
 
 it ' s one-word 
 yeah 
i don't usually at home either one-word 
what does your house look like
do you have any pictures of how your house like
no but here yes i have pictures of the room of the room in the
hall and of the pantry and things like that because 
but uhm in the past uhm i have a a friend uh who likes to
take pictures very very very much
uh she always uh ask me to take picture of her
yeah so uhm some weekends uh we go to hong kong park the hong
 kong park one-word to take pictures
 
 oh 
of what
just the city or people or what 
no
picture of her
 
of her all speakers laugh 
i one- word do that
 one-word it ' s funny because uhm a girl
my one-word from beijing live nearly the school at the
same time that i was there
but she run she run for a seminar or congress with hong kong u
and then she showed me her pictures and then a few days later i
showed her mine
and on all her pictures she was there on uhm
right it was her in front of something else on her with someone
and her in front of the part of this her with a famous person like
oh she was uh on the front row of each one of the pictures
and i showed her mine
uh very beautiful like where are you alright
and i i didn't do it on purpose but it ' s so happened
there ' s a single picture of uh that i taken in beijing
wow
and it isn't single picture of beijing where i ' m on it
and no pictures at all like where are you
and uh maybe you can key in your picture to that like
i don't bother that i can know where was there
and i don't specially i find it ' s extreme like formal
extreme to the other
a lot of people here and so you pick up the japanese
 two-words 
and you take so many pictures and you words like 
one-word fund of something else
 but i like take him that something else more than
myself
it ' s that one-word what i look like
right now you now i can feel frustrated
i didn't have any pictures of me in beijing
but it ' s really funny
they completely different where we have taken pictures
so that ' s that ' s kind of take i love to take pe people
as well
people i don't know people expression
but then two-words we need the very very
good theme to do that
so that ' s why i two-words 
i can up with people and chat to them one-word
it ' s one-word about thing 
yeah it ' s annoying cause i i like to know so much more about
 hong kong people
 one-word since you walk on the streets you
get the impression that
there are white people on one side and chinese people on other
and that those two never mix
is that impression you get as well 
 yeah 
uhm to me i ' m afraid not
because uhm i think that uhm 
actually the situation uh varies uh from different classes
uhm yeah uhm for those uh middle classes
i think uhm there are increasing more uh connection
between uhm foreigners and chinese
uhm for several i knew uhm go to causeway bay or central
it ' s very easy to find that some chinese are with some foreigners
and uhm there are quite they are not uh
separated i think
 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
but of course uhm for the general public or uhm 
maybe of younger generation
when they uhm uhm doesn't have the chance to meet uh
foreigners
uhm yeah they don't have uhm any foreign friends 
except on icq uh yeah
 
 yeah 
but it ' s it like a lot of white people don't ever bother to
learn cantonese and a lot of
when you walking the street a lot of local people uhm or their
english just isn't good enough
so it ' s very hard to understand each other 
 
 that ' s one of the reason like normally people should
english but in fact they don't they
> there ' s no use they just it ' s not necessary 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 oh 
yeah but in hong kong the situation is quite complicated i
think
uhm you know cantonese is not uh very important
it ' s only a dialect so the foreigners won't bother to learn
cantonese
maybe just some greetings uh and some very simple
simple conversation
but for hong kong people to learn english
yeah the it ' s really a problem of the education system but
maybe because of the mass education so more and more people have
the chance to learn english
but they uhm don't have uhm a real contact with 
 foreigners in their daily lives
so their english is very limited
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
but do you think they should learn english when they are in a
country like now hong kong belong to china and 
after all should hong kong people learn english as a
compulsory subject 
 did 
 yeah of course 
because hong kong is i guess uh it ' s still an an
international city 
yeah and english is an international language yeah 
if we know only cantonese or mandarin it ' s impossible to for
hong kong to maintain its status as it has now
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yes it ' s right 
but to improve the english of general hong kong people is 
not an easy task 
actually there are many people uhm discussing about this
question 
yeah uh and i think that uhm universities uhm can be good
places for people to lean better english
because it increases the chance uh for the hong kong people to
 uhm to contact with foreigners
 because most of the lecturers and some uh
classmates are from foreign countries yeah 
but i ' m not sure 
and i don't know whether it ' s my perception or it ' s re 
it it ' s uh truth that uhm
i found that one-word it seems that there are
more and more people going to international school
i don't know why 
because in the past i uhm didn't know much people are studying in
international school
but right now i know many friends that they did study in
international schools
so their english is quite different from uh yeah 
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah it ' s pretty good 
so maybe now they focus less on english at normal schools
so people who want to improve their english really have to go to
international school 
yeah
 
but it ' s it ' s gonna worth for me to to be in a university
and and have all these foreigners come to teach
if that uh i mean i imagine that happening in france
i mean if you have a lot of english teacher and they would
feel like like who want one- word to to have a
system of our own
we have to import teacher from abroad and it would be good and
people would learn english which is an international language
but french people would regard a hurt to have all these
foreigners coming from abroad to teach them as if they can do it on their own
which is uh for mes it is strange being in hong kong it ' s
having all these foreigners teacher taking every department and 
yeah
 
it it like 
but especially the uh arts department
faculty of arts 
 
 yes 
faculty of arts 
yeah because uhm the school of business uhm most of the
teachers are are
 
hong kong 
yeah
 
well hong kong is about business 
 laughs 
and there is an actual pro problem that uh if
 the lecturers are all chinese
then the medium of instruction will change to
chinese
 
 yeah 
yeah 
just like professor lui or 
he can't help taking in chinese
 
 just professor lui oh god 
well yeah but then all the all the people in the class
understand so much more
so much better
like he one-word he speak cantonese so has a
joke to tell and suddenly the whole atmosphere relax
and everybody start laughing and he ' s really 
happy and everybody was very happy
and but 
 yeah 
 not really
i hate his jokes
 you know they are si tut 
just i don't know
they are not related to to the topic 
 
 yeah 
 to what you saying i 
yes they annoying several words some kind of
ink
but i never get the ink when he want to say something in english
uh no
those are back bad jokes i mean yeah
 
alright 
and he likes uh to make jokes on people ' s name 
 two-words yeah
 
 people ' s name 
oh i one-word notice that 
uh it ' s terrible
