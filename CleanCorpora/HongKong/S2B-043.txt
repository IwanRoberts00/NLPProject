can they keep their customers satisfied
""
from a system administrator  ' s office to the users  '  desktops
messaging systems have promises to keep
""
it won't be easy to live up to the promise lan-base e-mail products
systems that let lan users send and receive electronic messages must gain
acceptance from two group that rarely see anything eye to eye end users and
system administrators
""
walk into any organization and ask about what kind of e-mail system
to buy and you would likely to find users and administrators in a face-off
 waving their individual agendas
""
end users have straightforward needs
""
they want a quick and easy way of exchanging messages  messages
and files with colleagues  from the desktops
""
they want to store and organize those messages in folders or
compressed archives
""
and once the messages are stored they need to be able to search and
retrieve quickly the information they need for that monday morning meeting
""
finally they don't want to devote entire week workdays to becoming
proficient at managing their mail
""
by contrast system administrators the people who sit behind the
glass door and make the mail system work favor packages that are easy to
install configure maintain and manage
""
what administrators think is important
""
efficient use of disc storage providing a reasonable level of
security and managing connections to other e-mail systems is usually of
little interest to end users as long as the system works smoothly
""
in this round-up on e-mail packages we  ' ll look at the issue form
both  perspectives assigning two reviewers to look at each package
""
one approach it from an end user  ' s point of view performing a
series of task from the  desk  desktop while the other concentrate on
installing maintaining and optimizing the system together the perspective and
administrator would have from behind the glass door
""
the products reviewed here or run on intel-based pc mail 
service  across  no  novell  ' s netware version three dot eleven
""
they offer interfaces to both dos and windows users
""
support at least an mhs gateway and offer remote  user access to
the company  ' s e-mail system  via a dial-up program that can be installed
at a distance site
""
the products we reviewed here include beyond  ' s beyondmail for dos
and beyondmail for windows lotus development corp  ' s ccmail for dos and
ccmail for windows da vinci system corp  ' s da vinci email for dos and da
vinci  uh  da vinci email for windows futurus corp  ' s futurus team dos
windows combo microsoft corp  ' s microsoft mail for pc networks  no 
notework corp  ' s notework windows dos combo and wordperfect corp  ' s
wordperfect office
""
all of this products have mastered the basic of  me 
messaging but in the battle for the hearts and  miles  and minds of
both system administrators and end users none were universally embraced by
both
""
the engine that drive an e-mail system must have two basic
components
""
a specialized data-based to store and forward messages and a
mechanism to route that messages to the appropriate address on the network
""
each e-mail message is actually a record in the message database
""
its address message content subject line and other elements are
fields in that record
""
in practice the data-base often stores only the message headers
along with pointers to the message text which is stored like a database memo
 field  in an external file
""
behind the glass door
""
acting as a sort of postmaster general the administrator manages
the database and creates the and maintains a global address directory that
leads the e-mail addresses of everyone on the system
""
the administrators the administrator also creates and manages the
user profiles which are  re  records that includes such informations
such information as where each user  ' s individual post office is located and
how much disc storage spaces are located to each user
""
the routing mechanism transports the mail
""
it can be a proprietary system build into a specific e-mail product
or modular one like mhs that pick it back onto the network operating system
""
there are  advanta  there are advantages and disadvantages
to both
""
beyondmail and da vinci email are examples of a program that have
no transport mechanism of their own
""
they rely exclusively on mhs for message routing
""
for the administrator the inconvenience of installing novell ms
novell  ' s mhs on a network is offset by convenient features such as ability
to encrypt messages during transport
""
the more complex the e-mail system the bigger the convenience
dividends in using  in  m  in using mhs
""
for example mhs-based system can read the mhs directory to create a
post office address book in seamless transparent manner
""
ccmail which uses a proprietary transport system is the first non
 m  mhs system to read the netware bindery the operating system  ' s own
database of user and enter the information into its own directory
""
this spares the administrators from doing it
""
but when you depend on mhs you can offer only those features that
mhs supports
""
microsoft mail three dot zero  ' s sophisticated transfer transport
layer can include more complex files types in messages
""
this  free the user from having to use binary  attachment
 if for instance they would like to include a worksheet with the message
""
as graphics sound and even video become an integral part of e-mail
communications microsoft mail will have a jump on the  com 
competition
""
user will be able to launch applications and view the files from
within their messages
""
quotidian tasks
""
 of all the day to day jobs that a system administrator must
perform deleting old messages to free storage space is one of the most
essential and tedious
""
any help from the  software can provide is a boon  is a boon
""
beyondmail assists with a  ma ma  with a macro that warns
both administrator and end user when the latter  ' s mailbox when the when the
 la  when the latter  ' s mailbox is full
""
and ccmail features a reclaim utility an administrator can run to
consolidate message-storing space in the same way that a disc optimizer 
defragments  files
""
another major administrator  ' s task although it only occur during
set up is creating the global address book for the system
""
any automated way of doing it such as importing user data from the
netware bindery or another external database is a big plus
""
more than half of the packages we reviewed feature some sort of
utility to migrate the data from the netware bindery
""
but perhaps most important in the ongoing maintenance of the system
is the administrator  ' s ability to back up the mail system and repair the
message database when its integrity is violated
""
the e-mail universe
""
privacy is always a concern in a shared environment and this is
especially true of a e-mail
""
most e-mail system offer at least   ru  rudimentary
password-base security
""
but this rarely protects messages from the eyes of those who have
supervisory rights to the system
""
microsoft mail encrypts messages and when run under microsoft lan
manager also hides the data files
""
wordperfect office allow users to encrypt files by assigning
messages one of five level of privacy from normal to for your eyes only
""
single products running on single lans often  one-word
 encompass linked  services  other e-mails other e-mail
systems and communication with remote sites
""
as the e-mail universe expands  connectivity  increases but
administrative problems multiply
""
most systems allow several file servers to be linked together into
one large mail system
""
this complicates addressing
""
multiple servers require more precise naming schemes than the
two-part scheme many system used earlier on a  onto  route the mail
""
in that the address contained a user  ' s name and the name of the
post office or server
""
most of the systems we reviewed use a three-part scheme that allows
a single local network to have several post offices
""
in this instances directory  propagation  where new users are
automatically added to attach the post offices is a desirable feature
""
but the complexities grow
""
in many corporations today different work groups choose their own
e-mail products without regard to what other groups are using
""
this poses no problem until the different groups need to
communicate
""
the problem is reminiscent of those days when various department
 ch  chose different word processors and then found that they could
not read the incompatible formats when they wanted to share documents
""
in the case of e-mail the standard solution is that dedicated
translator call a gateway
""
most gateways are system-specific
""
that is they link to specific e-mail systems such as ccmail and
wordperfect office
""
when more than two or three systems are being connected setting up
the links can become an administrator  ' s nightmare
""
mhs can ease communications difference difficulties among
incompatible e- mail systems because it serve as a common intermediary
language
""
developed by action technology and subsequently bought and marketed
by novell mhs is the oldest and most widely use e-mail standard we have
""
any e-mail product that can talk to mhs either at its own transport
system or through the mhs gateway can link to any other such system
""
but there are competing standards
""
microsoft has implemented its messaging application programming
interface mapi in microsoft mail and its schedule plus scheduler
""
and last year lotus announced its open messaging interface which
this year evolved into the vendor independent messaging standard
""
lotus is jointly developing vim with apple computer borland borland
international and novell
""
see the sidebar mail-enabled applications help groups work together
""
the desktop perspective
""
the transport mechanism is at the back-end mail system
""
each package  which  we reviewed has at least four front
ends a dos version a tsr version to  pull  into the background and
notify users of incoming messages a window version with a graphical interface
and a remote dial-in version
""
ideally this version should all offer the same functionality
""
but that is not always the case
""
da vinci  ' s dos version for example was one release ahead of its
window version at window version at the time of our review
""
it had more features
""
a situation da vinci  pl  plans to correct
""
all of the  pack  packages reviewed here are on a equal
footing when it becomes to basic addressing tasks
""
in each you  ' ll find pick lists from which user can select
addresses
""
all have speed search capability  that will  ma  match a
name in the database to the first  few  letters the user types
""
but the similarity ends there
""
some like ccmail allow both user and administrators to create
personal address list
""
other allow only administrators to do this
""
microsoft mail offers send folders to log the messages you send
""
but few others do
""
without a send folder you have to remember to copy yourself on
every message or else you miss half the point of e-mail keeping track of what
you you have send to others
""
creating messages
""
creating e-mail messages should be easy as writing letters in your
favorite word processor
""
cut and paste search and replace tabs fonts rulers and all the
others standbys of modern text processing ought to be available
""
and you ought to be able to use your own word processor to compose
an e-mail message
""
but except for wordperfect office which is closely tied to
wordperfect itself
""
none of the packages have this option yet
""
the new dos version of ccmail and da vinci email however do
include conveniences such as spell-checks spell-checkers
""
for now if you want to send a graphic or an  executable file
you are forced to attach binary files
""
a well-designed e-mail package should facilitate this with point
and shot attachment point and shoot attachment procedures that allow for
multiple attachments
""
futurus team allows sixty-four attachments per message
""
the cc mail and microsoft mail front ends for windows workstations
call the window client  window  ' s  clients do it one better which
drag-and-drop attachment
""
all a user needs to do is click on a filename and drag it into
their message
""
but attachment should become less of an issue in the future as
more and more applications allow you to send rich compound compound documents
that incorporate graphics sound and video
""
information overflow
""
as the number of messages increases storage space on the server
diminishes and information becomes hard to find in the clutters in the
clutter
""
if end users fail to archives archive or delete their messages the
task falls to the administrator
""
an organized  system-wide  approach to storing and
archiving  solves both problems
""
an e-mail package should allow user to store active message thread
in folders and archive older inactive messages on the local machines
""
most of the reviewed packages let user create personal storage
folders
""
some allow users to  ne  nest folders as subtopics for more
detailed message organization
""
da vinci email for example allow up to thirty-two subfolders
within a primary folder
""
but archiving information is only useful if it is easy to retrieve
""
and unfortunately finding needed information remain difficult at
best
""
the programs we review let users search the to from subject date
and priority fields
""
but it is tough to get at keyboard in the content of the message
""
microsoft mail  ' s message finder  allows you to search text and
provides the luxury of letting you conduct a global search
""
ccmail includes a search feature but you can only search one
folder at a time
""
grouping toward groupware
""
today  ' s e-mail packages need considerable refinement before they  ' ll
become all that they can be
""
but they provide a promising foundation for that shadowy
futuristic concept call groupware
""
groupware is evolving in the form of networked workgroup
scheduling document management and shared databases
""
usually accompanied by a programming languages language or system
or rules for managing and automating the way the components work together
""
e-mail system are already beginning to take on a groupware look
""
microsoft mail for example is bundled with microsoft  ' s schedule
plus a group schedule  sche  a group scheduling module that is fully
integrated with the windows e-mail client
""
ccmail da vinci email and futurus team have their own schedulers
developed by third parties
""
wordperfect office four dot zero goes one step further and
includes scheduling as an integral part of the package
""
office  office pursue workgroup computing by allowing users to
launch wordperfect applications and other selected applications including
microsoft excel from within the mail program
""
to do this it uses a  ma  macro language with dde dynamic
data exchange linked to the applications
