""
good evening ladies and gentlemen
""
first of all i want to point out the misunderstanding of the
opposition side
""
in hong kong there are a lot of companies big or small introduce
american style of management
""
but they do not become a american company really
""
today we  are  a rational and practical debate 
""
if we want to transplant the whole system of america which 
two-words  many things such as basic law standing order of the 
pu  uh legislative council 
""
can you please tell us how good the present system work
""
and also what other channels can the executives be checked 
""
as mentioned by our captain there are altogether four features of
the american style committee system
""
permanence  formal structure long standing staff and open public
""
and also she has provided three problems in our legco
""
now it is my job to illustrate the problem the first two problems
to you and explain how advantage bought by the american style committee
system could solve this problem 
""
first of all the  low efficiency  of the legislative council
""
what  ' s happened in our  legitive  legislative council
""
there are some temporary bills  '  groups which are responsible to
scrutinize the bills
""
but they are not permanent
""
they are only formed  as they  ' re  necessary and they will
be dissolved after they finish their job
""
however we know this is very  inefficient 
""
if we have one hundred bills put into legco for example can we set
up one hundred bill groups to deal with this problem 
""
maybe it  ' s possible
""
but how about two hundred bills three hundred bills and more and
more bills 
""
it is realistic
""
according to a statistic  there is only forty eight bills  '
groups in nineteen ninety zero but it increased to seventy one in nineteen
ninety one 
""
moreover most of these bills related to the same aspect like
education environment housing
""
should we set up so many bills  '  groups 
""
moreover since the ad hoc group are temporary  it must start at
zero if it is formed 
""
the most uh obvious example is the airport issues 
""
when the airport issue come into legco the members find that no
system or no committee system could deal with this problem
""
this is start new committee to deal with such as transport uh
construction work for  instance  
""
it is a waste  of our  time and resources
""
to be concise the existing system is inefficient and also waste
time and resources 
""
however if we introduce american style committee the committee will
become standard which means it exist much more longer
""
therefore the members can more concentrate on their work on the
committee
""
and also the bills could point into a standing committee which the
member did not to waste time on forming ad hoc groups 
""
therefore  this totally increase the efficiency of the
legislative council 
""
second our legislative council also lack of expertise to deal with
the growing capacity and more technical problems raised by the bureaucratic
government 
""
the embarrassing situation of this hong kong university of science
and technology is a good example
""
at the very beginning the ad hoc committee could not provide good
and sound  apprise  and opinions to the issues
""
finally it  ' s  out of  control 
""
if we have this committee beforehand  expertise can provide good
example to this and they could be checked on the policy which will not make a
mess  as  all we know 
""
therefore moreover  standard committee can  ex  can
provide congressional staff which they are expected to be an expertise also
because they deal with the same problem for a longer period of time 
""
ladies and gentlemen i  ' m sure you  ' ll now agree with us  that
 the american style committee system is  benefit  to us 
""
i  ' m sure that the committee system could solve the long lasting
problem of our legco 
""
also american style committee system is  certainly 
reasonable and suitable to introduce to hong kong 
""
our opponent please give up your worries and you are welcome to
join us
""
thank you 
""
""
""
madam chairman ladies and gentlemen
""
yes we have  been  debating and debating what is  the
 american style committee system
""
that is the existence of the american style committee structure
plus the necessary power destined that comes into  it mix in  american
style committee system
""
i can tell you that structure without necessary power is simply
useless 
""
and that is what we mean by the american style committee system 
that  we didn't misunderstand any single point of it 
""
as the proposition said that they do not  point that bill
initiation this sort of power granted by committee system and that we have to
move any changes within the limit then just incorporate part of the american
style committee system
""
to move along  and think of that  you have actually twisted
the motion
""
that  ' s not a real and full american style committee style system
so what  ' s the purpose and what is your aim to insist to inject the american
style committee system to hong kong 
""
in the present and future constitution constraints already laid
down on the power  of  legco 
""
and  the  american congress
""
what did constitution grant it
""
the power of the house of representatives to initiate bills through
raising revenue
""
for example like taxation policy those things
""
but the basic law article seventy four stated that bills which do
not relate to public expenditure or political structure or operation of
government many be introduced with the written consent of the chief executive
""
and this already pose limitation of the power of our legco
""
and this is actually the constitutional constraints
""
and what  ' s the purpose of the many constitution simply to inject
it through american style committee system as what you have proposed
""
and that this relates to other question what is the ultimate goal
of all hong kong people facing the drastic transfer of sovereignty already
approaching
""
then stability is the main  stake  we have to maintain so as
to achieve a smooth transfer and smooth convergence
""
do you think that hong kong is able to afford any rigid
constitution which will cause crisis that antagonize china
""
i mean do we able to afford such crisis that will  reckon 
the confidence of all hong kong people 
""
and actually for any legislature the main functions are to
legislate to check  one-word  the administration as well
as to control the  one-word  to be accountable body
""
but specialization expertise all these claims as marvellous
advantages by the proposition is simply a means to enhance the efficient
functioning of our legco
""
and it is a false logic that only a follow-us structure can serve
as an enhancement
""
 moreover  such a formal structure based on american style
committee system possesses disadvantages that won't fit the uniqueness of
hong kong
""
particularly inflexibility  caused by those permanent bodies
""
hong kong is such a vibrant place
""
it is the center of international trade and commerce
""
we need flexibility
""
we need  this  involve our law and policies making levels
""
the composition of legco mainly made up of members of different
functional constituency and it represents the civic  sectional 
community
""
so flexibility provided by ad hoc groups is what we need
""
most important of all what are the problems without legco and this
is the burden of proof by the proposition
""
be clear that we do not advocate any stagnation
""
in fact in the present situation there are already incremental
changes in our legco
""
significantly former omelco panels already transformed into a legco
 ma  panels as it will  one- word 
""
and being  cur  being established corresponding with
different administrative department like the american style committee system
""
these bodies do study policies and serve as a check on the
administration
""
the problem is that do you have so many bills money bills that 
are subsidiary  legislation
""
and that we need ad hoc groups because we don't have any airport
issues everyday
""
so ladies and gentlemen don't be conceived by sweet talk
""
do support us for we are being wise and rational
""
thank you 
""
""
""
ladies and gentlemen
""
the proposition has made  some funny errors
""
they claimed that the basic law allows legislative council to
initiate bills
""
well i guess it does in a way
""
but the basic law  as  article seventy four clearly states
 it cannot initiate any bill that deals with public expenditure political
structure and also the operation of government without the written consent of
the chief executive 
""
that  ' s a really negative power
""
i mean if you are gonna to give that to me i wouldn't feel too
happy 
""
also they claim that it has no permanent expertise
""
well janice  ' s already answered that one so i  would just 
leave that
""
i  ' ll move on to structural efficiency
""
they say  that  there  ' s no efficiency
""
legco has been known to pass  a bill  in thirty minutes
through all three hearings
""
to me that  ' s pretty efficient
""
thirty minutes is pretty quick
""
also within a day they have passed legislation through all three
hearings to buy several banks  to  prevent bankrupts therefore the
public won't lose its confidence in the banking system 
""
efficiency is another matter that you can complain about but i
complain about the american system
""
the house committee on rules and also the education and labour
committee has been known to be a deadlock
""
deadlock that  fosters  the hostility between democrats and
republicans
""
efficiency  does not  stand there 
""
also when you bring out the science and technology example the ad
hoc committee
""
excellent point
""
i would have to say that that assures the efficiency and power
that legco ad hoc has
""
that committee uses its power in a threatening way when s y chung
refuses to stand before the committee  hearing 
""
they said if you don't come to our hearing we will use the power
 several-words  from nineteen eight five and enforce you
by  one word  of legal sanction 
""
s y chung went to the hearing 
""
also i  ' d like to say accountability the last point that they
mentioned the first speaker
""
we believe in accountability but we believe that you must work
within the  parameters 
""
they are bringing in this american style committee system 
""
pretty shaky
""
i say that you have to work within the parameters
""
these  parameters  are set by the basic law
""
you must make sure that you don't break basic law
""
it  ' s not good for hong kong or the people
""
you see we think that you should work within the grass root policy
""
forget these you know all these official exco or legco
""
 several-words  the people not as aggregate
total numbers
""
but for the individual concern things that matter to the
individual everyday  people
""
we believe that you should  widen  the mandate
""
patten has done so with  several-words 
ombudsman
""
that is an excellent move  several-words 
""
 two words  should be more accountable and
increase in the power and strength
""
also now that hong kong has a bill of rights why not educate
people although  three words  
""
it will increase the amount of  access  points and the
information  toward from  the people to the government
""
you see we believe ladies and gentlemen that the government should
be seeking information from the people and not people from the government 
""
we believe also that the freedom of information ordinance can be
enacted
""
so  several-words  british official secrets
acts
""
no one  should suppress all those  information 
""
to update  also we believe that exco and legco can work
together
""
legco can work as a cooperative parliament that helps the
government and sheds light on issues of public concern
""
therefore this will increase and keep the public confidence in the
system not shake it with  inter-governmental  hostility
""
that doesn't do anything good for the people of hong kong
""
also and lastly incremental adjustments is what we want
""
these adjustments will shape hong kong to something that is good
for the people no just good on paper
""
an evolution and not revolution
""
an evolution of stability and everyone  several-words
  federation  of peaceful and stable change transition
towards the handover
""
 one-word  american style baseball and
hamburgers
""
this baseball you know it  ' s all a form
""
we don't even have  them  here in hong kong
""
i don't believe that we should bring that in
""
it  ' s not practical and it  ' s very  one word 
""
let  ' s just say you can't just implant it artificially implanting
something in hong kong
""
i don't think that really works 
""
we don't have baseball and burgers in hong kong
""
what we do have is china coming in nineteen ninety-seven
""
oh i have one more point
""
actually no i don't sorry
""
thank you very much ladies and gentlemen 
""
""
""
well thank you for question
""
i am afraid that it is not our side agreed with their side
""
it  ' s just the other way round
""
their side agrees with our side
""
as we stated from the very beginning in the american committee
system the power to initiate bills especially concerning the public
expenditure is an important essential element in it
""
it is part and partial to the system
""
without it this is not an american style committee system
""
it  ' s just a shared american style system
""
now i agree that  con  constitution of the us has granted
its power to congress but how is this actualized
""
it  ' s by the committee system
""
so my proposition side it  ' s important that you should recognize
the weakness here and also the check and accountability
""
well ladies and gentlemen may i say that these are functions that
 one word  has formed by the legislature but these
functions cannot or these functions may not be performed by the legislature
alone
""
and  for  our side we try to say that stable evolution with
incremental changes  are a way  like relaxing or killing the official
secrets act which can definitely force the government into greater
accountability and transparency of the government
""
and also the strengthening of  all the means  like 
watch  system
""
these are what we state
""
and in fact by borrowing a shared american style committee system
cannot work these out
""
thank you
