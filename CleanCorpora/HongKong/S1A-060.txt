 
""

""

""
uh we can talk about anything
""
anything you  ' re interested in
""
perhaps we could start by asking you  something interesting that
you  ' ve done this week  laughter 
""
tell us anything interesting happened to you 
""
""
uh  uh inside this week i will uh have many  have many
 dinners with my hallmates because uh this week uh there will be a  my
hall had  and my hall will have a uh tradition  uh dinner
""
  uh  it is about uh  just uhm  joined other 
floor 
""
other floor mate and  have dinner together uhm
""
it  uhm   rep  represent that  we after  finish
this dinner
""
we  ' ll uh start uh uh to work hard to study hard
""
uhm  uhm get excellent result in examination
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
""
which hall do you live in 
""
""
uh simon k y lee hall
 
""
uh ha
""
does anybody else live in hall 
""
""
yes
""
  i  live in university hall
 
""
 yeah  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
but uh my hall haven't got the  the dinner yet
 
""
i mean is it  is it coming later in the year
""
or what 
""
""
coming later
 
""
yeah
""
what about you two
""
do you live in hall 
""
""
no
""
i don't live in uh halls
 
""
uhm uhm
""
what about you 
""
""
i don't live in any hall
 
""
no
""
do you wish you lived in hall 
""
""
oh  i don't wish
 
""
yeah 
""
""
because uh uh in hall there may be uhm  many activities
""
uh that  i think uh may make me uh no time for revision
 
""
uhm  uhm 
""
""
and  and maybe uhm  prohibit me uh to join uh  to
join other activities uh  in the campus
 
""
right
""
what about you
""
yvonne 
""
""
uhm i  ' m  i wish to live in hall for a  while
""
uhm because i think  uh living in hall is a part of the u life
""
and i want to try it
""
uhm  but the disadvantage is uh  just as jachin said
""
uhm  there  ' s too many activities you want to take part
""
and there  ' s no time for  homework or  re  revision
""
uhm  but i  also want to try it
 
""
uhm
""
are they right  about the
""
you know the problems of living in hall 
""
""
uh there are  of course many activities
""
but i think the most important thing is that
""
uh you need to know
""
which is the most important to you
""
if you think
""
uh  at that time
""
you need to study
""
you just go to study
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uh  ignore other things
""
""
but they force you to go
""
to take part
 
""
  yeah  
""
""
 is it    easy
""
to ignore all the   things 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uh  i think it  ' s  need to practise  laughter 
 
""
uhm  somebody coughs 
""
but  i mean i think yvonne  ' s got a good point
""
i  ' ve heard  people say that  that certain activities are
compulsory
""
is that true 
""
""
uh
 
""
see tellus is nodding 
""
""
uh some of the activities are compulsory
""
but not all
""
uh  i agree with jimmy that uh  you have the  right to
choose
""
uhm  of course uh  uh some  you must  pat 
participate in
""
but uh many others you need not to participate
""
  it  ' s just  up to you
""
uhm  if you  are good at manage how to manage your times
""
uhm  it  ' s no problem
 
""
 uhm  
""
yeah
""
if  as a big if
""
  isn't it 
""
yeah
""
don't you find there  ' s a lot of peer pressure 
""
""
  two words   
""
uhm
 
""
you know
""
that your hallmates are  pushing you to participate 
""
""
uhm  it is not  uh  necessary to participate in
""
uh so  if you  ' re not
""
uh  are really not interest in this part
""
uh  you  can ignore this pressure
 
""
uhm
""
i think it  ' s easy to say
""
but do you really think it  ' s easy to do 
""
""
uhm  i think it  ' s not easy
""
because  uhm  when there  ' s 
""
uhm  most of the uh roommates
""
are participate in the teams
""
you will be affect by them
""
and you have no  top   talking topics with them
""
because  you are uh  have no words to say to them
""
and they don't like to talk to you
 
""
uhm
""
you mean because you haven't  participated with them 
""
""
yeah
 
""
same as when you didn't say hello to me today 
""
outside the library 
""
""
i haven't seen you  laughter 
 
""
yeah
""
do i mean
""
does that happen
""
jimmy 
""
""
happen to me
 
""
well
""
not necessarily to you
""
but  other people in hall
""
does it happen that  if they don't participate
""
you ignore them 
""
""
but i think it  ' s uh  to different people
""
uhm  if someone has a  kind heart
""
uh he would  find something to  talk to you
""
  try to find something  
""
sometime it  ' s it will be  uhm difficult for him to talk to you
""
if you don't  uhm  don't  participate in some activities
""
uh or  nearly all  hall  1ights   will
participates
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm 
""
""
uhm  but i think that  ' s just a  very small proportion
""
of our of our  topic in the discussion
 
""
uhm 
""
""
better than uh in the talking  uh  something
""
in the talking    talking    policy 
 
""
 talk talking with whom  
""
 yeah  
""
uh ok 
""
uhm jachin do you think it would be a problem
""
if you were in hall 
""
now you said already that 
""
one of the problems would be finding time to do things 
""
""
it may be a problem
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uh but uhm 
""
i agree uhm  i  agr 
""
i agree that uhm  uh  it  ' s a good practice
""
to learn how to manage your time
""
your personal 
$z-clears-throat  time
""
uhm
 
""
i supposing you don't learn 
""
don't you think it would be a disaster   somebody-coughs
""
""
""
uh  i think it depends on the  the actual circumstances
""
""
i think it  ' s difficult to guess
""
uh what the  re  what the result will be
 
""
uhm 
""
""
but uhm i think  uhm  if  living in hall
""
there are many activities
""
but uh  i think some activities  is very good
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and  and  i think  uh  we can learn how to 
how to uh  communicate with other people
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and how to live with other people
""
i think uh this is uh invaluable
""
but i still  worry about uh  uh living in hall maybe uh 
less or  maybe  no personal time
 
""
uhm
""
  i  ' ve   i  ' ve heard a lot of people say that
""
surely must be some truth in it
""
now i think tellus has a got a good point
""
if you  ' re well organized
""
and so on and so on
""
it  ' s not a problem
""
and she looks like a well organized person  somebody-laughs
""
""
but  then when we look at jimmy
""
i  ' m not so sure  laughter 
""
no
""
i mean
""
seriously
""
just my impression
""
that you probably 
""
not so easy for you to say no to your friends
""
do you  do you get any personal time 
""
""
 they  
""
""
uh  i  ' ll get my personal time in my home
""
that  ' s  that mean i will uh  try to keep out of my 
friends
""
when i   need  some personal time
 
""
 uhm  
""
do you find that uhm   two words  the exams
are coming up quite soon it  ' s on
""
do you find that 
""
if you really want to get any work done
""
you don't go back to the hall
""
but you stay here in the library 
""
""
yes
""
i  ' ll stay here for the library
""
until the library close
""
and   then  
""
go to hall for the sleep
""
""
 mm mm 
 
""
 right  
""
seem  seem a bit crazy that you  ' ve  you  ' ve got a room in
hall
""
but you don't actually go there
""
cos you can't do anything 
""
""
uh  i think   sometimes 
 
""
  two words  to see   
""
yvonne  ' s nodding
""
i mean don't you find that a bit crazy
""
where do you do most of your study 
""
""
at home
 
""
yeah
""
but like he say
""
he can't do it at home
""
if  one word  hall is the home 
""
""
oh
 
""
would you find that difficult 
""
""
i don't think so
""
 one word   uhm i first live here at the
library
""
because  i think it  ' s it  ' s stiff it  ' s that
""
i don't know the word is
 
""
 one word  for   what  
""
""
 it  ' s stiff  
""
""
suffocated
 
""
oh
""
right
""
right
""
yeah
""
ok 
""
""
uhm
 
""
why 
""
""
because  somebody-coughs 
""
the  circu  i  presume  that circulation of the air
is not  one word 
 
""
uh ok
""
so you don't really go in there 
""
""
yeah
 
""
yeah 
""
i always think it  ' s cold in there 
""
""
and  colour
""
grey colour of the library make mis feel sleepy
 
""
uh  laughter 
""
so if  if you lived in hall
""
you  ' d really be in trouble because you won't be able to study at
the hall
""
and you wouldn't be able to study in the library
""
what would you do   laughter 
""
""
uhm  i think i  ' ll study at hall at late night
 
""
uh but 
""
i i also heard that things happen late at night in the hall 
""
""
uhm
 
""
is it true 
""
""
late
 
""
late at night 
""
""
late at night
 
""
yeah 
""
""
what do you mean
 
""
well
""
other students who live in hall
""
tell me that 
""
sometimes they don't go to bed until  three o'clock
""
  four o'clock in the morning  
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
yes
""
it  ' s true
""
  uhm  because uh  at early uh i think at the early
of the first semester
""
uhm  many people in live in hall
""
uhm  our hallmate will think that uh uh
""
this time is uh not a  studying time
""
and then later and later
""
so that you will uh  play uh  watching tv
""
playing tv games on the bed
""
uh  after they finished all these things
""
uh it is already uh uh  uh one o'clock or two o'clock
""
so they start  to study or some  sometimes they fell
asleeping
""
uh they  they just go to sleeping
""
this is true
""
but uh  uh 
""
now uh the examination is coming
""
uh many  the  ex  atmosphere in hall is change
 
""
 mm   
""
""
uh ha
""
""
uh for example
""
in my hall
""
uh many  hallmates
""
just uh  close their door
""
uh  to study in their room
""
not come out uh watch around
""
uh don't do other things that is not necessary
 
""
uhm
""
somebody  who lives in hall
""
i can't remember which hall
""
last week was telling me that
""
they started to pin little messages on people  ' s doors
""
  to  encourage them   to study 
""
does that happen in your hall 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yes
""
yes
""
yes  
""
uhm  i don't know
""
what exactly
""
it is a message paper or uh
 
""
 one word  something on red paper 
""
""
yes
""
this is
 
""
sort of   good luck 
""
encouragement    notice  
""
""
 yes
""
yeah  
""
 yes
""
it  ' s true  
""
uh  it is a  tradition in a hall also
 
""
uhm uhm
""
is it in yours 
""
""
yes
 
""
yeah
""
what kind of messages do you put on people  ' s doors 
""
""
uh get a good pass in the examination
 
""
without studying   laughter 
""
""
of course you need to study
 
""
yeah 
""
  which  
""
""
 get   excellent grade in the examination
 
""
yeah  somebody-coughs 
""
do you when when you find something like that on your door
""
does that really encourage you 
""
does it help 
""
""
a little
""
but i think uh  this also give me some pressure
""
because uh  if i look at it
""
uh  i  ' ll think to myself
""
will i get a good grade in   the examination 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
or maybe that  ' s the purpose of it
""
make you work harder 
""
""
perhaps
 
""
yeah
""
do you think that will be helpful
""
for you to don't live in hall 
""
now supposing somebody  came to your house at night
""
and  pin something on the door 
""
 to  make a difference 
""
""
i think it  ' s very nice
""
uhm  if i if i receive uh uh such a paper
""
uhm that is uh uhm  tut 
""
i think uh uh
""
to me it is  very  encourage
""
i i i feel very  en  encourage
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and i will  really try try more  more hard
 
""
uhm 
""
""
to study
 
""
uhm 
""
  what about you  
""
""
 yeah i think   it may help
""
because uh  when you see the  paper
""
it will remind you to study now
""
and uh  little pressure is good for  everyone 
""
to to force you to study
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and uhm  when you look at the paper
""
you  you may think that someone is supporting you
""
and you have the power to go on and go
 
""
uhm
""
do you do you think there  ' s too much pressure in hong kong for
 education 
""
""
yeah
""
i think uhm  there  ' s  many examination
""
that you have to pass
""
and  and that  ' s too many student uh  to apply uh the places
in uh  college
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uh  you have to fight for the  examinations
 
""
but  but you four
""
and you were successful
""
cos you  ' re here now
""
so does that make you think it  ' s a good system 
""
or bad system 
""
""
uhm  i don't know
""
it is the  it is a good or bad system
""
but i think it  one-word   it is uhm  the
most  the best one at present
""
because  before you haven't got a better one
""
you have to uh take this one
 
""
uhm 
""
easy for you to say
""
because you  ' ve survived  the system
""
what about the people who aren't successful
""
do you think  unfair on them 
""
""
uhm  they may  they may good at other skills
""
or  other aspects
""
they don't know
""
so they have to uh  find out
 
""
uhm 
""
""
give chances to them to find out
 
""
do you agree with that 
""
""
uhm  i agree that this system is uhm  it  ' s ok
""
uhm for those who can't successful
""
uhm  there are  also many choices for them
""
for example uhm  some cannot go to the university or other 
polytechnic
""
they can uh  apply for the uh  diploma courses
""
uh courses in   universal  uh in the polytechinc
""
or they can go to other uhm  uh industrial  institution
""
something like   that 
 
""
 uhm     a fairly long pause then laughter 
""
""
what
 
""
i just wonder what you thought about it
""
you  ' ve been successful
""
right
""
you  ' ve gone through hong kong school   passed those exams
 
""
""
 i think we are the lucky   one
 
""
uh ha 
""
""
because someone uh maybe doing best  better than me
""
in some fields
""
but they don't get to the  tertiary education
 
""
uhm uhm
""
why  ' s that   noises 
""
""
because they don't like to studies uh science or  art
""
in the uh form four or form five level
""
then
""
the door is close for them
""
uh  to further their study
""
i think it  ' s quite unfortunate
 
""
uhm
""
uum
""
what about  the system from now onwards
""
you  ' ve been successful so far
""
do you think it gets easier or harder or  no change 
""
""
easier for
 
""
for you now 
""
""
for me to
 
""
now you  ' ve entered the university
""
  is  it gonna be easier or harder 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uh  easier than  the people before me
 
""
no
""
i mean easier than before you came here
""
easier when you were at school 
""
  easier  than when you were at school 
""
""
 uh   a few words   
""
because uh  places are  uh  uh more  one word
 more available
""
than before
 
""
uh ok
""
what i what i really mean is  that  you  ' ve been through
the  secondary school system and you say that  ' s quite hard
""
now that you  ' ve got into the tertiary system do you think that  ' s
easier 
""
the university
""
is it is it easier than at school 
""
""
education system
 
""
uhm   a fairly long pause 
""
""
i think if you are  trying to study something  uh 
in the university the university is try to give you some  very 
sophisticated things about the  about the  about the subject you study
""
so uh  the education will not be easy for you but the most
important thing is that you need to have some interest in your field
 
""
uhm  a fairly long pause 
""
do you agree with that tellus
""
i mean i  i  ' ve heard a lot of students saying the hard thing
is to get into university
""
once you  ' re here it  ' s easy 
""
""
uhm  sometimes the examination need uh  we need some
luck to go to university i think
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uh ha
""
examination is  ver  uh uh your  abilities very
important but uh  you must include some  uh lucky i   think 
 
""
 uhm  
""
which bits do you think are down to luck 
""
what what elements do you think are involved with luck 
""
""
uh for example how you choose yours uh your  subjects uh
at the  a 
""
it  ' s your priority of your subject
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
uh sometimes uh  if you think you are  good enough you
can choose a  better or  uh  for example engineering or architecture
or  dam  uh medicine    
""
but  if you  ' re not  uh so  outstanding then you must
choose uh some subject such as science  or arts   or  uh 
that uh something likes arts or science
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
  uhm uhm 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
but if you don't know what is your places uhm then you choose
""
for example i  ' m not  in fact i  ' m not very good in academic
result but uh so i choose science because it is easier for me to  enter
the university
 
""
uhm 
""
""
if i choose medicine or if i choose engineering as my 
first choice or   and then  over the twenty choices i  ' ve choose
all of them
""
 it  ' s  engineering  subjects
""
then i think i can't go into the university
 
""
yeah
""
is that  true about your  academic results
""
or you  ' re just being modest 
""
""
uhm
 
""
are you just being modest 
""
""
what is the meaning of    mo  
 
""
 just  shy   
""
""
shy
 
""
yeah
""
is it true that your  results are not very good
""
  or you  ' re  too  uh you don't want to  to tell
us 
""
but you have good results 
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
uh  i don't have good result in a-level examination
 
""
uh ha
""
  ok  
""
""
 i   i can foresee this   uh  
problems so i choose  science
""
  as  my  few uh  uh first uh  i think i
think uh it  ' s about the choice of number five
 
""
 mm mm  
""
 right  
""
uhm
""
if you could  choose anything at all     what
would you choose 
""
""
 uhm  
""
i i will choose social science subjects
 
""
uhm
""
ok
""
that  ' s harder than science 
""
""
uh  the criterias
 
""
yeah
""
it  ' s harder to get a place 
""
""
uhm
 
""
yeah
""
i saw jachin laughing when you were talking about  you know
making choices of subjects
""
why was that 
""
""
uhm  i don't think so
""
uh  science is uh  uh is comparatively uhm maybe uhm 
much  much uhm  easier uh to get 
""
mm i think science  is is uh  is a topic of  richness
""
""
very wonderful
""
and  i think that it should not be  be pull down
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and  tut   a fairly long pause 
 
""
why did you choose science 
""
""
uhm  it  ' s my interest
 
""
uhm so for you it  ' s not a question of academic results 
""
""
uh  it also depends but uh  the proportion is not that
much
 
""
uhm  when you said science is wonderful i saw yvonne smiling
""
why do you smile at that   laughter 
""
""
uhm  in my case i also uh  didn't done well in my
academic results uhm but it  ' s not the reason for me to choose science
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
actually the first  choi   my first choice is
social science and  and science is my second choice
""
uhm  i think uh science is  is interesting because i  ' ve
studied that for  four or five years and uh  and i think  if i 
if i were  uh sent to the medicine uh or other faculty i wouldn't done
well because i don't have  this uh ability
""
  also  i think i  ' m  i don't have this ability
 
""
 uhm  
""
yeah 
""
""
 so   you mean you have ability to done good in uh
to do good in science
 
""
  uhm  
""
""
uhm  yeah more chances
""
""
more chances
""
""
and i think uh  undergraduate studies uh is uh provide
provide answer to  and also uh  is clear answer uh to learn something
to uh  the skill
""
 three words  uh  have the skill to learn
something
""
it  ' s the fundamental studies
""
uhm  the  one word  is not important uh 
to  uhm  to look at uh  which subject of one  ' s  which which
which subject of uh one study
 
""
uhm 
""
""
i think it  ' s general education
 
""
ok 
""
""
just train one 
""
just to train one uh how to think uh  his mind
""
something like that
 
""
uhm
""
it  ' s an important skill
""
right 
""
""
  uhm 
 
""
 uhm   if you have the chance  to change would you
change  
""
""
i have consider this uh  at the beginning of  this
semester
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uhm uh  i  ' ve talk to some hallmates which is studying
social work
""
because social work is my favourite choice uhm  they suggest to
me that uhm  if you wish to  uh change your subjects you  can uh 
first done well uh do it well in this year and get excellent result and then
change and or you do very well in this uh coming three year and then you
study postgraduate  ' s uh studies in social work
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uh when i heard it i  i think i will choose the uh  uh
the second one

 you can know uh  uh uh you are you are you are doing something uh very
good or not

more difficult than you think it is to understand the feedback but yeah uh i
think it  ' s a good wish

when i was a secondary student i wish to become a social
worker but when i enter this university i know that  uh i must study three
years for physics

and then  uh  if my result is good uh  then i  can
have a chance to uh study postgraduate in social work

future here

quite  not quite sure for me to answer  because i  i  ' ve been in the
university for nearly  one year uh something is  changing  one
word  even my interest uh my character and other things

the future i think  i would like to  uh be a postgraduate in my  in
my subject yes
