 with which case 
uh it ' s me 
 uh that ' s on 
 
 yeah 
it ' s quite good
 
i bought some uh uh the films and the last time you remember

yeah
 
it ' s not bad
but this time i brought this one from fuji
 yeah 
 fuji 
 fuji is not that good
 
 i don't know but uhm i use the fuji in germany
 and uh i was always uhm happy with the quality
so i think just try it 
 but 
 uhm 
uh oh 
 because 
 
 alright 
give it a try maybe it ' s it ' s it ' s worth
because the price is almost the same i think
maybe the fuji is little bit uhm cheaper 
really
 not cheaper
it ' s cheaper
cheaper than kodak 
 
 yeah 
 but fuji is a little bit dark i feel
 i don't know 
 
 i don't know 
i uhm either me
but maybe it it ' s good enough 
uhm uhm
oh

tai o

i think it was a sunday 
 uhm uhm 
uhm
 
uh i even met some italian people there 
really
 
yeah yeah
well it ' s too small 
a lot of tourists will go to that temple
 
but even even chinese people 
there are a lot of chinese people around 
yes because you know hong kong is not and and 
 laughs 
 
okay 
and when you go for like sunday and saturday you will you

 and
 laughs

and in macau have you try a dessert
 
you mean the uh the one with the egg inside the yes
 yes yes 
 uh yes 
 do you like it
 
it ' s not bad
i like it 
 laughs 
you don't like it 
i like it i like it 
oh you go to the beach there
 
uh no no this was at the harbour or the the
here ' s tai o 
 oh 
 oh 
 uhm 
 
and then yeah you can catch up the ferry this point 
 and but i had to wait
because uhm i miss one ferry and then we had to wait for one
and a half hour and the weather was really bad at that time
 a very strong wind and it began to rain rain 
 
but i was lucky had my my rain coat so 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 you 
 uhm 
 uhm 
you go there with your friend
 
uh no uh no uh no 
uh but you meet many foreigner
 
uh yes but i don't know why 
i normally do not talk too much to foreigners it ' s
you look at each other and you recognize and you think oh maybe
he ' s from american or from europe 
 laughs 
but normally i don't speak too much
it ' s more you ' ll try to get in contact with local people and
 and sometimes
like in last weekend when i was in ching chau the
the man standing next to me talk to me and then he showed me around the
island everything
so this was very very lucky and and
 it just things just happens or maybe
sometimes nothing happen but 
 laughs it ' s like this 
 yes 
you always met some people take you around to
 
 no not always
but sometimes you meet people and they tell you something about
uh 
this is for example uh it this would be great for the
monastery
because you you recognize all the the the monastery and
temples and and buddhas
but you never know why and or how old this is
or maybe you see some signs or english uh
chinese characters
but you cannot uh guess what it means so 
sometimes it would be really great
be because i ' m interested in to have somebody explaining 
 the characters and 
 uh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh 
 yes 
true
uhm
 
uh so no
it ' s start again 
yes it ' s start again 
so you have a very nice experience in macau tour 
right a long pause and
 laughs 
have you discuss with maurizio about the workshop
a little bit
but i i haven't discuss all the scenario yeah 
 
 uh yeah we start the scenario 
 we can we can this a long pause
uhm uhm 
basically i will other other cases you will discuss
you tell us last time you told two-words
and i ' ve tell him how how people
if all the people speak german how how you react 
and another thing is uh in in in all you you feel very 
disappointed or you feel very unhappy with all the things in germany
you you you do not understand how
you don't understand pe what the people say you
if you alone you feel lonely and how how you will
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 
react 
react yeah 
it ' s another case
 
 uh 
this is 
i i think this is this is really good
the same as the the the scenario with the german oh everybody
speaks only german 
uh and i think it ' s it ' s very good to uhm as the students
or the sn is thinks about this 
but it will be still different uh the reaction now and the
reaction in germany
because it ' s it ' s very hard to 
 to really imagine oneself in this situation 
so maybe some of them they have al already some
experiences 
but even for me i always thought uhm i have seen a lot
of places and uh i always like you know open minded knowledge 
 laughs that stuff
but it ' s still really different when you go really to a 
uh uh other place
 and when you stay there not only seven weeks but
maybe seven month
or or when you really have the problem that everybody uh
around you talks only german or cantonese or whatever
this is this is then something else than just thinking
about
but of course it makes i think talking about this 
before you leave makes it much more easier later
when it really happens 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 ngaai 
interjection of regret or disgust 
 yeah 
 yes 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yes exactly 
 
so uhm i of course i ' ve thought about something like
this
but maybe because it ' s also you you ' re a issac member
and you think oh for me this is not really a problem 
 laughs 
or maybe this is it will be different
or sometimes i thought okay there will be ups and downs and
there will be some problems and sometimes you 
let ' s say cry and sometimes you ' ll laugh
but you don't think too much about it
because i was this is this was a kind of dream uhm to go
abroad 
as i told you uhm three years ago was the first
time i want to go abroad
 and i waited and i had so many plans and the
i made so much effort but it was not successful until now
so uh because you are so keen and and on on going abroad
and and this is like your biggest wish
you accept nearly everything and you don't think too much about
it
if you think just okay it let it begin and then it happens
and so this was maybe my case
even the preparation uh i didn't do too much for for it 
 and
 laugh 
even when you leave for six month it ' s it ' s
really different than just going va vacation for weeks 
you have to think uh or consider other things 
but i i think maybe in the last twenty four hours before my plane
took off i did everything 
 bu but i had three weeks time to do everything but
 you are just happy and and you think about different uhm experience you
will have
and you don't really do anything for preparation and
then until the last moment
oh i should buy this and maybe i need this and
 
but i think this is really good 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uh 
 yes 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yes it ' s true 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
do you feel the same case in hong kong
uh i mean lonely or alone 
yeah
 
 lonely 
 it it yeah exactly this is uhm the the 
 the my university you had
have you been to fortime 
 uhm 
no i didn't
 
 no 
 fortime is uhm is supposed to be the the gold city
of germany it ' s
and it ' s that like the gate the entrance to the black forest
 what do you mean by the gold city
 oh 
 
 gold city
uh it ' s because all the jewelry industry in in germany and this
is a a very long history or tradition
it settled in in fortime 
 uh ha 
uh okay 
 uh okay 
 
so uhm it is let say quite famous 
uhm
 
uh but it ' s not very very famous uhm regarding to uh a
university city like munich or standgard or 
lumberg or one-word 
this is more or humberg more famous
so when i arrive at fortime uh i was of course like
everybody else disappointed
because fortime was unlucky after world or shortly
before uh world war two ended
uh the americans uhm made one of the last attacks 
 and the
they dropped some bombs on fortime 
 but they they missed the target 
it they they should have bombed some other place and because it
was night and foggy and cloudy
they hit fortime 
so uhm seventy or eighty percent of fort fortime
 was destroyed
 and fortime was a really really wonderful city
i saw old pictures with old very huge
buildings and 
anyway uhm they had to rebuild everything very quickly 
for the people living there
so the buildings nowadays one-word 
some are really ugly or like just huge buildings
make up of concrete not special very dark
and when it ' s rainy and you
you look at fotrime it like it makes you really sad 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh uh uh 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uh 
oh
 
so of course 
but it ' still and there ' s in germany but now you are in
hong kong
it ' s different
 
yeah yeah this
but in in uhm what what what ' s the the point 
uhm
 
yeah so uhm of like everybody else i was disappointed and
thought oh why fortime me 
the university has a very very good reputation and
 some very good professors and lecturers
but why fortime is 
you are not only in fortime to study i mean it ' s this
is part of your life 
so after a while you realize that it it is not only important
where you are but who you are with 
 uhm uhm 
 uh 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yes it ' s true
 
yeah so uh one semester ago yeah i think uh we had or like
you have in in in hong kong uh like orientation camp for the 
 new comers 
 yes 
 uhm yes 
fresh freshman
 
fresh yeah
and uh normally uh the the student uhm tut union they do
this 
but or because we share our uh office with the
student union
we ' re very close to them 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
 
and uh it was in the morning and i was just checking the the uh
isacc emails
and then one of the uh boys or guys from the student union
came over and told me
oh we need your help
if you are free this afternoon you can make a guide with the
fresh people throughout the university and explain something to him to them
 
and i told him yes why not
i mean i had no idea what to say 
 laughs and what is necessary but yeah
so i did this and uh 
he gave me some papers so you have to mention this and that 
 and some regulations and show this room and that room 
 
and at the very end we uh i went to in a in a in a room
and uh asked if they have some questions 
and oh i remember one girl told me uh you know we this
morning we had a bus uh tour around the fortime 
 oh and it is so ugly and 
 and
 laugh even the university is
i mean it ' s a very good reputation indeed but it ' s not 
special 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yes 
 uh ha 
and she asked you how do you overcome this so 
 
 no and then she asked me if if uh yeah if this is
normal and uh she thinks about maybe change university therefore 
 and
 laugh 
 and then and then suddenly a lot of people say yeah
yeah this is true this is true 
 laughs 
and then i told them oh wait stop
this is i know your feelings
it was the same with me and with everybody else in the first 
few month few days 
 did they did they two-words uhm 
uhm
 
but after a while you you just recognize that it is more
important uh which people are si are around you
what friends you have
 you could stay even in new york in hong kong in
uh paris
but and and maybe you have a beautiful city but 
you not
you do not have really friends it ' s it ' s not worth 
 yes 
 uhm 
yes it ' s true 
 uh 
 
so yeah it
right now it ' s hard for you to understand this but maybe in one
year you woulds think this uh the the same and uh 
 yes 
i understand it ' s like when people always ask uh which one do
you like more
you like germany more or you like france more 
 i ' ve been there two places 
and i ' lls i usually just stop
i don't know how to answer because like for people i i like
germany more and i have more close friend in 
germany 
and i have a bunch of friend there
but uh for the city i think i like france more and i can do
shopping and 
 laughs and i like the food there
so i don't know but the place is france but the people i like
germany
so it ' s really hard to say
and i also feel that sometime like many place in the world is
pretty the same
it ' s most important which you ' re handing with and
 
how do how do the city give you some like tut belongings
 and 
so it ' s more important about the people i think
 
 yeah 
 oh 
 two places 
 uhm uhm 
 
 uhm uhm 
 yes yes 
 uhm 
 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 
 yeah 
after maybe the third 
so this is what happens to me here
after the first five six weeks now uh i mean
i have now my apartment uh apartment my room all speakers laugh 
uh the the working place and you have the daily
 routine and everything so you you get used to it
you know some places where to go to eat 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm
 
so it ' s it ' s the excitement is not like at the first
 day 
and then you you start thinking about as i told you about friends
back in germany 
or maybe sometimes you come back home uh from work and it ' s
 seven o'clock half past seven you had dinner
and you start thinking oh what can i do now 
or uhm i like tsim sha tsui very much 
 uhm uhm 
 yes 
 yes 
 uhm 
 you like tsim sha tsui uhm 
 
 yeah and sometimes i go just there
when the weather is fine of course 
 laughs i sit at the harbour and drink something and look at the
beautiful view
and and this very moment i think it ' s it ' s not very
maybe for you for local people it ' s it ' s not
very special to sit there 
but for me it ' s something very very special 
 uh 
 oh oh 
 yes and also like 
it ' s different like when you are in your hometown you have too
much thing to concern
 you have too many friend
you have many thing to do
and you don't have free time usually
 oh 
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
uh yeah it ' s different like me 
i do not have to think about my family uh about friends about
shopping
because uh the the most important is working
when you finish this you have no
responsibility so you can do with your time whatever you want
 
you can go out and come back tomorrow morning
or you can stay at home not nobody cares
 it ' s just up to you
so in this moment when i sit there and and enjoy the view uh
in in the night hours
it ' s i and i think about my friends
it makes me sad because you experience nice things 
 and you want to share this with your friends 
 yes 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 and it ' s hard to share sometime
 
 yeah it ' s hard to
you can share this in your heart and you think of
of the faces and and what how they would react in this moment 
and or what they would say
but it ' s it ' s not like this when they would be really uh
next to you 
so this this is now i ' m i ' m start to feel a little bit lone
because even macau it was nice and uh i enjoy the
two days
but of course it would be different to go there with somebody
else would be more fun 
and uh in in in in this moment or at this time you
realize again what you told the pe uh the the the fresh uh uh
students at university that
 one of the most important thing is the people
and now it ' s it ' s it ' s true it
i mean i love hong kong it ' s a is 
i don't know what what i would say about hong kong in three weeks
 
 or maybe in three month or in 
three years 
but still i think it ' s it ' s a really nice place a
wonderful place it ' s
you have forest you have the island you have water 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 wow 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
and it ' s very richable 
 yeah 
 
yes you have you have uh poor people rich
 people 
you have good food bad food 
it ' s you have uh uh many foreigners living here so it ' s
 very different and uh you have uh
sometime is more traditional chinese culture sometime it ' s
 uhm nearly like in europe 
 yes it ' s very one-word 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yes
 
so this is it ' s a really good experience and the it ' s
everything is new to me 
uh ha
uhm
 
so uh i uhm because some some people told me oh
maybe after three weeks you will quit and and just come back to germany
because it ' s all so awful 
 why 
 oh 
is it like people not not having a very positive
image towards hong kong or 
 
 yes 
not only hong kong but only the fact that you are not at home
they cannot imagine going going
so far away
because i cannot say oh this weekend i ' ll go just home to to say
hello
it ' s not possible when you are in uh uh uh
one of my girlfr uh yeah friend
she ' s in in in london 
and for her it ' s no problem
for one day or for two days going back to germany 
 and and maybe takes some stuff or go out with
some friends or just stay with her family
but for me it ' s hard 
 oh 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm 
 germany 
 yeah 
 oh oh one-word go 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yes 
 
so some people told me uh maybe would one-word
 it will be too hard
but uhm i didn't think so
and or i don't think so
and the it ' s i i never uhm how to say uhm 
uh i know the german word 
 laughs 
see this is now uh uh how to say a situation where i know the
german where and even the english expression
but at this moment i cannot uh guess so it ' s never bad
to have to have a dictionaries 
yeah
 
uhm a long pause several words 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm uhm 
 
 one-word several
words 
so the german word would be one-word 
 one-word 
 
 one-word 
and we got one-word where is it 
 is it very popular for using this dictionary
i saw almost
 
let say uh there oh i forgot this
uhm there are si like uh some some brands
uhm and i think for english is one-word
 is the best 
 but maybe for french and for uhm like
southern european languages like other ro romanian
languages uhm two-words 
 uhm 
 one-word 
 oh oh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 the l 
the l
 
yeah the yellow one the two-words 
 is maybe better
i think their experience in in in this field is better but i
think for english one-word is really 
good and 
 the one-word 
 oh 
 one-word 
 uhm really 
 there ' s so many germans
 they don't have this just the same then
almost all german family have one-word 
 
 yeah 
uh no 
 laughs 
no this is one-word 
of course this was my first dictionary
this is 
 fir first your first dic
 
 
 twelve years old now 
 twelve year old oh happy
