the heart of the global economy beat to the rhyme of the united state the asian financial crisis who have caused the world recession three years ago if not for the robust american markets putting everyone else alone but now the vital size and the us are worrying after eight consecutive good years mr alan greenspan recently forecast that the us gdp growth rate would only be two percent this year he also predicted that unemployment would rise to four point five percent computer sales both for personal and industrial uses has  deslated  companies are inventing in new machinery the way they use to president bush has repeatedly warn about the slow down and prescribe rightly or wrongly tax cut as the medicine but statistics tells only half of the story the other half is being told through annerdose  car companies are sacking workers by the thousands selection prices and closing plants general motors had shut down a whole division whole mobile price verse is over one-word is us operations auto part suppliers are badly affected the rapid affect is spreading throughout the economy us banks are titling landing and may yet call in more loans magic mergers especially immediate and drug companies has stop after the recent bleed and previous america masons haven't yet produce the winners the overall value internet companies most never having earn a profit has done venture capitalists the inflow tag and telecom sectors the power behind the new economy are we can a moreover us retailers had countered on christmas two thousand sales to tide them over but instead they are now left with huge inventories especially of garments electronics cosmetics and toys some of which came or re-exported from hong kong us federal reserve has reacted by cutting the prime rate twice inside a months the first time is done so in fifteen years the open market committee at the reserve has been equally  one-word in its latest assessment seeing consumers are holding back and credits are being squeezed americans who previously spend their wage a boom and lifted the global economy wisdom can continue to one-word  here in hong kong our financial secretary appeals to be doing his sums in isolation mr donald tsang and his team has reported the hong kong gdp growth rate of ten point seven percent for last year and forecast four point one percent for this they haven't really read these numbers with a deflation rate of three point seven percent in year two thousand which suggest the recovery was more illusion than substance for most people mr tsang had to look no further and uh free mode property market to understand the underlying stress in the economy and the lack of confidence hot serious growth hong kong has had lately has been in an inflow tax and export sectors but nearly all the listed internet stops are trading now at the fashion of the highest level a year ago more are going under because there is no fresh capital coming in exporters are say americans are beginning to cancel or postpone orders in anticipation of poor demands for the rest of the year european union recovery is bonded to stop once it feels the impact of the us slowdown both send to hong kong high spending tourists who may delay their  one-word or cut back on shopping dining and entertainment hong kong is try to diversify its appeal to tourists while there are now more south east asian and chinese from the mainland visiting hong kong these are expended this then means less foreign exchange the dramatic reversal of fortune is hitting hong kong severely at the most difficult time we are now facing a huge budget deficit for the past year the financial secretary has few options if the growth rate  lackens and the revenue strike the government has for political reasons narrow the tax base further in recent years this has forced middle and upper classes to pay more taxes so that the others can enjoy the benefit mr tsang and his destined successor mr anthony leung can expect existing tax payers to go on carrying a heavier burden the government has increased some fees and charges  one-word the liberal party opposed and will continue to oppose people earning less because of the mandatory provident fund are sure to resist small and media enterprises can afford to pay more to saying that hong kong taxes are among the lowest in the industrialize world it ' s more fiction than fact when we add in all the other charges the lower party think the alternative the tax increases should be government authority  one-word administration has preached but not practiced public expenditure continue to rise despite an advertise high increase and one-word restructuring this is because civil servants are still too generous to themselves there are now more senior administrative positions than four years ago before the asian financial crisis we think that tax payers should not be asked to food the bill for government over hiring and over paying in some cases this contradiction can persist the current budget which is being finalized must be adjusted to the affect of the us slowdown and its impacts on hong kong but financial secretary mr donald tsang must remember that hong kong is economically not an island how history creates its talent is being decided right now as he put the finishing touches to a spell out budget there must ban as a testimony of his confidence vision and understanding of the global economy and hong kong ' s part in it  i table the motion in legislative council last week i suggested that the government issue multiple visas to high earning visitors from the mainland i also suggested that add in investor category of mainland immigrants i was presently surprise that my motion passed overwhelmingly and the secretary regina ip said my proposal will receive serious government consideration hong kong has right now losing consumers every weekend three hundred thousand people cross lo wu into shenzhen last year alone they spent an estimated thirty five billion over there equal to about fifty percent of our consumer spending we have to think other way to reserve the traffic and recover some of the loss the way to do that is to allow high income people from the mainland to come to hong kong more easily to visit spend and in some cases live in recent years china has created a class of entrepreneurs professionals and ninety expertise typically a lawyer earns upward of ten thousand dollars a months a technologist double as much and an executive fifty thousand or more shenzhen just happen to be one of the highest earning cities in china many of these people in shenzhen are from other regions of china we know that because each day there are at least a dozen flights out of shenzhen for beijing alone we could get these people to spend weekends and holidays in hong kong rather than in other cities if we make it easier for them to travel here the answer is a simple multiple entry visa critics of my motion say they are afraid that these people would over stay i don't buy that argument people of such an income level with steady employment are going to go underground take jobs in construction site and restaurant or enter into a life of rise  other also say my motion if turn into a policy will discriminate against the poor i don't buy that argument neither the fact is all countries discriminate if that ' s the word against visitors with some money and steady employment more and more mainland chinese are becoming tourists nowadays they found that ironic that it ' s less bureaucratic for them to travel to countries in southeast asia than to hong kong we have become perhaps too arrogant in thinking all chinese who want to over stay in our city those who have seen paris london and san francisco may find hong kong the way we find it expensive rude and polluted the main problem is that our government has set a quota of one thousand two hundred tourists from the mainland a day where therefore forcing people who want to come to pay between one and two thousand each for visa if we give people multiple visas as a one off fee we reduce their cost and we also bring more businesses to our shops the more controversial part of my motion was my suggestion that the government negotiate with the central government for a new investor category of immigrants over the past four years since i return to chinese sovereignty china has developed at the pace we have never anticipated there are now million of ethnic chinese some of them are given exit visa to immigrant and live abroad i think it ' s important that we recruit these people rather than see them settle in singapore canada united states and so on taking their talent and asset with them right now hong kong has an exclusively family reunion immigration policy towards the mainland chinese i support this programme i hire the one uh immigration policy to be reviewed and broaden each day we let in hundred and fifty people from the mainland nearly all of them are job seekers or young dependants of hong kong residents from the lower income group they have contributed to the widening gap between the rich and the poor in our society we must do something about this by letting in about fifty investor immigrants from the mainland a day to address the imbalance and create work and other economic activities i think i ' m reasonable in suggesting that these economic immigrants should bring in at least five million each and have business plants this proposal is not uncommon among other world nations the united states for example ask for seven point eight billion hong kong dollars canada two million dollars singapore six point five million dollar and australia three million dollars for each investor immigrants the united states for example ask for seven point eight million hong kong dollars canadian two million dollars singapore six point five billion dollars and australia three million dollars for each investor immigrant we have to set a limit that ' s neither too low nor too high too low then it wouldn't do much for our economy and too high we won't be able to persuade them to come there are also a bonus in bringing these successful people to hong kong many of these new immigrants will have the contacts connections and knowledge to help us seek business opportunity from where they came this is especially important for us as our other main trading partners go into recession while china continues to boom i ' m not so naïve as to ignore the dangerous of money laundering in and attractive shady people to hong kong but i ' m sure that the chinese government will screw light those people it qualifies for an exit visa to immigrate abroad some critics accuse me of class discrimination by wanting to let in the rich but realistically all other countries ' investor immigration policy only let in the rich we should open our doors to those who can help us since the government has accepted my proposal i urged it to act quickly the longer we delay the more skilled educated and entrepreneurial chinese will choose elsewhere at our loss  the consumption or sale tax proposal is not new the government posted the idea in the late eighties at the time of huge surpluses the financial secretary of the day quickly withdrew the suggestion because it ' s look really in the face of a bursting treasury but now the issue has taken on urgency because of another fiscal deficit and a new financial secretary eager to make it ' s smart the liberal party agrees the present tax system is too narrow unfair and distorted one hundred thousand people out of three point four million that work paid most of the income and profit taxes without getting many tangible returns they put out with this sort of socialism because that is the price for stability having a consumption tax may be a good move if that means making seven million citizens give and not simply take from the one-word hong kong also must have a balanced budget as prescribed by the basic law but introducing a new tax can only be done during boom times which these are not government is not to provide the latest gdp growth forecast until the end of the months but already bank economists have on their own estimated that the annual growth could be as slow as one point eight percent the economists intelligence unit has suggested a figure below one percent hong kong ' s most important export market the united states has all but gone into recession corporate profit has vanished and companies are sacking workers by the tones  american economists who once predicted the recovery in the latter half of this year have postponed that we bond to some time in the middle of next year even the mainland market is not drawing it ' s a death in recent years the story in the south korea and southeast asia japan has been in a slump for the past decade and the restricted promise by radical prime minister will cause many more layoffs ten  one-word and cut backs hong kong is a slightly to whether the global economy ' s storm and find shape true the low interest rate may help the property market by easing mortgage payment but then hong kong will feel the global economic pain eventually as to impact from difficulties in its main market take time to  one-word  between late ninety eight and two thousand our economy rebounded from the asian financial crisis thanks to the booming high tech and export sectors but now high tech is winding from the nasdaq wars and the internet and telecommunication stock collapse importers in the united states europe union australia nature  are casting or skiing back orders our local retail businesses will suffer as consumers lose confidence and a small shoppers go across the broader for bargains if the government would impose the consumption tax now it would hurt local stores by compelling more people to spend less locally and spend more in shenzhen early in the year the administration just introduce the mandatory provident fund that alone has posted a major burden on employers and employees who have to allocate ten percent of salary to meet their new obligations the money invested in the mpf skill is money out of immediate retail circulation any new tax is not acceptable until the economy has digested the effect of mpf the government and its consultation paper says any con  tax will be modest just as what all government say to lower public resistant to an unpopular programme but the tax were also eventually he will have to raise a low tax to justify the administrative cost for its collection the government conceived that a three percent consumption tax will yield only eighteen billion result restraint the work on administrative cost there will be a temptation later to increase that net intake i would cite examples of other governments raising consumption taxes in increments the british to start introduce a reasonable sale tax of five percent that has since recent to seventeen point five percent the canadians in the province of british columbia place a heavy combination of provision sales tax and value added tax that together increase a purchase by thirty percent the french have to pay out a sales tax of twenty percent americans australians and europeans have experienced the same such a tax like a drug to which any treasury can get hope and find so hard to win there ' s no doubt there where a consumption tax is introduced there will be the start and not end of a cycle of tax increases the government will surely rationalize the extra tax of familiar argument of how health care welfare education housing and some re  services may suffer if it does not raise the levy the liberal party opposes such a tax as a time of weak economics we urged the government to defer adding taxes and for that matter fees and charges until the economy has become robust enough to take the booms hong kong once try as a tourist destination because of its reputation as a shoppers ' paradise a whole street of shops along nathan road one-word  practically to no one else than visitors the tourist trade as our second largest source of foreign exchange but over the past decade or so a combination of inflation a hong kong currency pack to the us dollar high wages and labour benefits has eroded that advantage today many tourists can get better shopping bargains on the mainland singapore and it ' s hard to believe japan hong kong is not only competing to lower tourists but also competing to keep one-word from moving to less costly rival cities more offering tax rebate and other in centres the consumption tax will raise the cost of living and may face out those job producing companies which frankly have other options before the government contempt a consumption tax it should first consider a cut in expenditure especially civil servants pay and purse the administration has never tied of one-word  its one-word but worse are of course not match by this when officials deal with themselves about sixty cents of every dollar the government spent goes towards paying the salaries of the hundred and eight three thousand civil servants and recently by the stroke of a plan three point eight billion was spent to increase civil servants ' salaries a few months ago the government finalize a programme for early retirement to pomp the one-word civil servants and achieve high efficiency just what wonderful in theory but the catch was that the cost for terminating employment was so high and the benefit to retirees was so generous that many more civil servants left and the legislative council finance committee was asked to authorize an additional payment the government has to practise more than its preaching cost cutting we had to live within our means and so why not civil servants our government should be in better fiscal shape than it is today for example the government of singapore has to pay twenty percent of its expenditure on defence and diplomatic missions while our does not because our central government bears full cost only when the government has proved itself to be  one-word and the economy has strengthen can it more really convince the public to support a consumption tax until then the liberal party joins other against the consumption tax whose time is not now
