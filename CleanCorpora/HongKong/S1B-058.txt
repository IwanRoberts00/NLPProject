does the government consider itself an employer of all those uh

mr deputy president  targets and target-related assessment
or ttra  are being introduced following a recommendation in education
commission report number four 
""
they are designed to help teachers parents and students measure the
learning process  thereby contributing to more effective education 
""
the decision to introduce ttra was taken by the government in
august nineteen ninety-one  with the support of the education community
""
""
since then the education department has developed operating plans
 prepared extensive briefing materials  and conducted numerous seminars
 to familiarize teachers with the new concepts and methodologies 
""
this will help launch ttra  initially at primary four  and
covering the core subjects of chinese english and mathematics in may nineteen
ninety-three 
""
at the suggestion of the omelco education panel  a pilot scheme
involving twenty primary schools was introduced in september nineteen
ninety-two 
""
its purpose is to obtain practical experience in the operation of
ttra  and to identify possible problems which might be encountered  in
launching the system 
""
the pilot scheme should help make the full implementation of ttra
as smooth as possible 
""
it follows that the effectiveness of the pilot scheme  should be
judged by the extent to which it either confirms that ttra can be implemented
smoothly  or identifies areas where improvements and changes are necessary
""
""
the instruments that will be used to make this assessment 
include questionnaires for school principals teachers pupils and parents 
feedback sessions and interviews with principals teachers and pupils  at
regular intervals  classroom observation  and school visits 
""
the pilot scheme is being run within the existing resources of the
participating schools 
""
this is because ttra are more in the nature of an alternative
approach to learning  than an additional one 
""
however additional resources have been provided within the
education department  to develop the necessary systems and materials 
as well as to train teachers  in their new tasks 
""
these amount to eighteen million dollars in nineteen ninety-two
ninety-three  rising to thirty three million dollars in nineteen
ninety-five ninety-six 
""
finally i believe it is premature to assume that some schools will
not have sufficient resources  to implement ttra 
""
the pilot scheme may throw more light on this 
""
on the broader front  the government is implementing a range of
improvements to enable teachers to devote more individual attention to
students in schools 
""
these measures in particular the provision of additional teachers
 will contribute to making ttra work in the desired manner  several
speeches   speech of the deputy president 
""
""
mr deputy president  the reduction in class sizes starting
with primary one in september nineteen ninety-three  is part of a coherent
and integrated package of measures  aimed at improving the quality of
education in our schools 
""
primary one has been selected as the starting point  for a
number of reasons 
""
it is logical  it accords with the recommendations in education
commission report number five  which have been widely supported  it is
likely to produce the greatest benefits in the long term  and it is
practicable 
""
to reduce secondary one classes to thirty-five as from next year
would be unrealistic 
""
for one thing it will require us to build sixty-five additional
schools during the next nine months 
""
the government  ' s plan  is to work through the system one level
at a time 
""
by nineteen ninety-eight all levels in primary schools will have
been reduced to thirty-five per class 
""
the smaller classes will then be extended to secondary schools 
commencing with secondary one  in nineteen ninety-nine 
""
by then  the forecast decline in secondary school enrolment 
will have made it possible to accommodate the smaller classes  without the
need for a massive school building programme 
""
in the meantime  the government has undertaken  to restore by
nineteen ninety-six the two repeater places per class  which were
withdrawn from the majority of secondary one classes  at the beginning of
this school year 
""
that undertaking still stands 
""
there is no question of partiality or unfairness of treatment 
""
the long-standing government policy is  to support schools at
different levels  to accomplish their respective missions 
""
secondary schools are different from primary schools in many
respects 
""
for example secondary schools are bigger in size by about seventeen
per cent 
""
seventy per cent of their teaching posts are at graduate uh are at
graduate level  compared to none at the moment for primary schools  and
they enjoy a more favourable staff to student ratio 
""
these differences apart  secondary schools will also benefit
from the additional resources for remedial teaching  and other
improvements arising from education commission report number four 
""
they will also be provided with additional teachers  as
announced in the governor  ' s address 
""
the government  ' s commitment to improving the quality of education
throughout the schooling system is now widely known and supported 
""
the package of measures we will be taking  will address specific
areas of need  and contribute to an overall upgrading of quality  and
standards 
""
there is no inherent reason  to require strict equality of
treatment  between sectors or levels of the education system  at any
particular time  and the absence of uniformity in no way detracts from the
impact of these improvements  several-speeches

mr deputy president in the reply the secretary stated that the
that standing instructions are there to avoid the sick building syndrome in
government buildings 
""
can the secretary inform this council whether standing instructions
should also be introduced to private buildings  and if not why not 
several-speeches 
""
""
mr deputy chairman  the uhm the uhm  uh secretary have
state that the air quality survey have been conducted in government  b
 buildings since nineteen eighty-nine and the result have shown no
serious problems
""
now i applaud the uh secretary  ' s effort in trying to control
ventilation problems 
""
however as we know the sick building syndrome is related to air
pollution  and can occur in buildings that do not even use
air-conditioning units 
""
so i  ' d to know  w  what these air quality surveys actually
consist of

do they include  uh contaminants such as volatile organic acids
 formaldehydes  particular organic materials  microbios uhm meaning
bacterial and spores  all of which have been  con  uh related to

""
uhm mr deputy president  while germany dumps industrial
waste in eastern europe  and the united states export toxic chemicals to
latin america  hong kong has been used as a dumping pit for dangerous and
substandard toys 
""
this is ironic  bearing in mind our relative affluence and our
status as a shoppers  '  paradise 
""
absence of control is to be blamed 
""
today sir i and my colleagues in this ad hoc group are glad to
present this bill  which is the first piece of legislation in hong kong on
toys and children  ' s  products safety
""
if carried it will provide better safeguard for consumers  by
making it an offence to manufacture  to import  or to supply in hong
kong  toys and children  ' s products which fail to comply with the
prescribed safety standards 
""
sir since introduction of this bill in april of this year  the
seven-member group held eight meetings including six with the administration
""
""
we have met with retail import and testing centres representatives
 and considered submissions from seven interested organizations 
""
the ad hoc group as well as organizations which made
representations to us  are in one voice  on the need to safeguard
children  ' s protection in hong kong 
""
so the question was not whether we should or should not have
statutory  safe  safety standards but what measures  and standards
we should adopt 
""
first  on control measure 
""
this bill does not  impose a duty on the authorities to test the
toys and children  ' s products 
""
and the administration has advised that the authorities will act
only on complaints 
""
this means that nothing will be done to test the product unless
enough injuries and enough complaints draw attention to the unsafe product
""
""
there is absolutely no point in having a standard unless that
standard can protect our children 
""
what good will a prosecution do 
""
it can only give  chil  a child it cannot give a child her
blind eye 
""
it offers little comfort  to a grieving parent when child when
children has been killed by  le  lethal toys 
""
what we want then are preventive measures  not  laid back
 damage control actions after a child  is maimed or killed 
""
the ad hoc group was very concerned about the effectiveness of this
approach  and suggested the administration to consider imposing compulsory
pre-sales testing 
""
this measure was recommended by some of the submissions too 
""
the administration advise us that they have examined the options
but decided against it 
""
while accepting the difficulties with regard to mandatory pre-sales
testing  the ad hoc group still considered  a more pro-active system of
control necessary to prevent injuries 
""
we therefore recommended  that some incentives be provided to
suppliers  to encourage them to have their products tested before they go
on the shelf 
""
to address the group  ' s concerns  the administration finally
agreed to insert a clause to the effect that a voluntary pre-sale testing
certificate will be considered as evidence for defence  to a charge under
this ordinance 
""
they also undertook to increase manpower to conduct random testing
""
""
sir i now turn to the question of safety standards 
""
the bill proposes to adopt the standards devised by the british
standards institute for children  ' s products 
""
this was  accept  accepted by the group without much
argument 
""
the deliberation on the standards of toys however sir was a
frustration  and drawn-out process 
""
with your indulgence i will elaborate on that 
""
the bill proposes to adopt for the adoption of the international
committee of toys industry  or in short icti standards for toys 
""
the group questioned this from the onset  having regarded to
the fact the icti standard was not as up-to-date as some other standards and
that the level of toxic chemicals in icti  which icti allows is much
higher 
""
the administration explained that the adoption of an international
standard instead of a national standard would avoid possible accusation of
hong kong being biased  towards the standard of a particular country
""
they assured us  coughs  the ad hoc group that icti was
very similar to the standards developed by other major markets  and was
supported by the hong kong toys council
""
here i would like to stress  supported by the hong kong toys
council 
""
as regards the possibility of including other national standards
in the bill in addition to the icti standards  the administration was
concerned that this might result in toy suppliers choosing to meet only the
lower safety requirements of the different aspects of the safety standards
 thus resulting in a set of and i quote lower standard unquote for hong
kong 
""
it was on this strength  of these arguments that the ad hoc
group was persuaded into accepting the recommendation
