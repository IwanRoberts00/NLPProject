<I>
 
uhm i have i have to do my job hunting right now
in japan it starts in right after the new
year 
we first have to uhm contact the companies 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
then what about uh as now you are in hong kong uh what
 about the interview
 
 yes 
uhm in japan we do not do the interviews soon
we first have to uhm contact the company and get the application
form
and then we send the application form
and then they uhm do exams and then interview is the
very last stage 
 uhm uhm 
you mean you mean that uh in japan when you want to find a job you
are going through a a application firm
 uh something like uh agency
 
 yes 
uh no no no no
 we just no no no
not a agency
not not a ap application firm
just you just form yeah 
 it ' s or 
 application form 
form
 
from yeah 
so we have to it like 
first we have to ask for application form and then the 
when the company is ready to send the application form 
then they ' ll send it
so uhm we ' ll like ask the company to send us application
form application form like in january february or march
and then the company will start to distribute those application
forms in april
and then they ' ll started to exams in 
some in april some may june 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 are they they have exams 
then how how can you do it
 
uh then i cannot do it
so those companies i have to give up 
so i do not have like a
i cannot try every company that i really want
i just have i have to consider like what like
the date of the examinations 
first yeah 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uh ha for for us uh have you go to our cc career centre
 
yeah 
it ' s really uhm always uh one-word 
with final year student as uhm in this period uh 
there
i think maybe there are more than two hund uh
 one-word more than two hundred vacancy there 
but uhm as uh for me uh ex uh for as
an economic student 
and somebody ask somebody said that will will uh we have
uh an advantage for finding jobs such as management trainee
 but in fact for me i find that uh the business
administration stream student is much better than us 
and maybe we just have some advantage in the 
banking field
 but however uhm if you see if you see the interview
list you will find that maybe most mostly uh the
 bba student 
uhm have large part of proportionally in the
interview list 
and for me uhm we ' s start we start job hunting 
 uhm since the first semester 
uhm about uh october and i think that
from from that time uhm to now uh i ' ve from already applied
for maybe uh forty or fifty application
 but yes uhm in fact i don't know what kind
of jobs i like 
as uh somebody ask me that as an economic student you should apply
for the management trainee and strike for more uh interview experience and
the aptitude test experience 
in fact uhm i don't know i uh i don't know uh what about in japan
uh
as in our aptitude test uh mostly 
different company use the same applica uh aptitude
 test form 
what about in japan
 
 yeah yeah 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uh ha 
 uh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
 uh 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 really 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uh yeah yeah 
uh i think we ' ll be they make you to uhm to take lot
of test like english test and those kind of one-word 
 numerical test yes 
or some kind of we 
 numerical test 
 uhm 
uh is there any uhm
 
something like a iq test 
iq test
 
yes
and some other like just to see i i don't know what 
the name
uhm but to see like how you behave in certain situations kind of
test test
performance test i guess i don't know 
 performance test 
 something like something like that i think
i i do not remember the name of the test 
in trade exercise
 
 uhm uhm 
i don't know
because in in japan it ' s called ph something test 
and they they oh the sa the company use the same
test for that one most of 
so they say you should have more experience 
so we have these textbooks for those tests 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
you have
 
yeah uh uhm 
 but for us we don't have any uh source of this
kind of aptitude test 
 
 uh ha i see uhm 
 but i think it ' s a little bit unfair 
if somebody have more experience in this kind of test as it
 wants to test your iq and or your english
if you have already done it several times i
think it ' s not very fair
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm
well i guess uhm accepting people through the test is not
really fair although 
because interviews should be more uhm important than that
those tests
so i think the companies are also think that way 
so i think it ' s okay 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 but i think the test is used for just screen
screening
 
yeah
but i guess people who cannot do good in those tests would not be
useful
 because there ' s so many people who who ' ll apply
for for that job
so they have they have to have some kind of way to drop you
 know to see who ' s really uhm okay 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 and then is there any job you are now have
uhm maybe have more uh 
that you have going to certain stage
 
uhm no not really
i ' ve only uhm contact companies to send me application form
but i haven't received application forms yet so nothing has started 
 
just uhm nothing really nothing
uh i was first uh interested in broadcasting companies 
 so i actually got the application forms 
but because i realize i can i cannot uhm take the exams 
because uhm it ' s in april 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
how uh how can you how can you know that uh the companies in japan
are recruiting
 
uhm because uhm the companies uh
uh system is different
we they don't have notices is that they ' re we ' re going to
recruit this 
 we just contact individually and and if and if they
send you back application forms
then you know they ' re recruiting 
 uhm 
then you mean uh maybe there is there isn't any vacancy 
 but you just try 
as in this year i take a i take a course called personnel 
 management 
uhm and there is also a chapter call about the recruitment and
 selection 
uhm also uh it mention a method for recruiting is
something write in and walk and walk ins 
it means that uh something like yours is uh the
 at uh the graduate or something uh the job seeker 
 why or write letters to the firm or walk
into the personnel develo 
department and then even if they don't have the vacancy maybe they
keep their resume as an active file
 then if there ' s some vacancy they will contact
them
 but i know that in hong in hong kong 
 the system is a little bit different 
most likely we ' ll we will go to see the advertise 
advertisement or the notice from the notice broad
and also uhm i have go to the career centre there ' s
 some counseling service for us 
and i ask the councillor about my situation uhm tut 
uhm
at first i ' m i want to try the management trainee or
 something like that
but in fact i don't think i ' m suitable for this kind 
 of job 
uh the first is that i think i ' m not the i ' m not an
aggressive or ambitious person 
and also uhm i think my ability may may not
suit this kind of job as uhm you know uh perry ' s
 boyfriend 
he is now being a management trainee in a large
firm and he tell me about what they are doing 
 as an as an mt
 i found it not quite suitable for me 
 and so uhm
and also i don ' have uh too i don't have not one-word
 i don't have too much chance to uh enter
some final stage or further stage of
 interview
so i i ask myself whether i ' m suitable for the business 
 field 
so uh at that time uh for the banking vacancy i ' ll
 i ' ll apply but uhm i think at that time maybe i want to be
something like a teacher 
as i like i like to i like to walk i like to work with
people such as being uh in the public 
relationship department
and in fact uh i like something like i like some job as the social
 worker 
maybe organize activities for the youth but i
don't i don't like uh such as counselling for the for the uh family 
 or for the older but just organize activities
 
so maybe being a teacher i have chance to in
charge of some extracurricular activities
 so uh at that time i ' m now try to uhm 
maybe like the method you use the creative 
job search
so i go i i ' m use i sometimes go to the career centre
 to ask some counsellor to help me
 
 yeah 
 yeah we ' ve try 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
wow do they help you a lot or 
 uhm uhm 
uh quite a lot 
they tell me how what kind of uh what kind of
element i should include in my application letter 
 
and what ' s the method to doing so
so uh just before i ask uh wing uh your
roommate how she got her job as i also
want to be a primary teacher primary school teacher
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 oh 
yeah she just got accepted to her hold 
uhm to her the one-word the primary school that she 
 was graduated right 
 uhm 
 uhm 
yes and also she said that it ' s through some 
relationship her her relat her relatives have some 
relationship with the school in charge
 so she can get that chance and also
 she tell me that she recognizes most of her past teacher
 still in the school
 so she ask me that maybe the chance 
to be a teacher is not too great but i can try my best 
 
and i will try my best
 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
so uhm what are you going to do like about this summer
are you just going to continue to do job hunting go somewhere 
 or 
 i i will go to job hunting first as most of the
teacher vacancy will uh will advertise in about from
may to july
 so uhm although many friends ask me to go to
travel with them but i think uhm if i miss this
period it ' s much more difficult for me 
to find uh teacher vacancy
 
 uhm 
 oh 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yeah yeah
you can always go travelling after you find a job uh 
 
 yes
and also if i can have a job and maybe in the august 
 or july i can go to some h i can go some short trip
 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm yeah 
and also want to save more money and then go to europe 
 so that i can buy anything i want
 
 uh all speakers laugh 
then you have to work hard i guess 
yeah uhm so that one-word uhm uhm
but what what subject do you want to teach if you become a
primary school teacher 
 yes 
if in a primary teachers i think that except
except english every every subjects i like
 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
uh i don't know what you learn in in in hong kong primary 
schools 
 in our primary school uh uh it use chinese
except the english language 
and we have chinese uh english mathematics
 and arts and some something like
we have two subjects one is arts just for drawing 
and the other is you do some little some little works uh something like 
uhm 
 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
food cooking 
but not cooking maybe use uh use the paper to
 to make some some little things 
but for art is just for you to draw
 
 uhm uhm 
 uh 
 uh ha 
uh okay 
or maybe you use some 
 
 so there there ' s separate classes 
 separate class and also uh 
something about health uhm something about uh the science
 the natural and also the society this
kind of subjects
so every subjects i i like all of the subjects except the
english
 but if they want me to teach english it ' s
okay 
 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm how about music or pe
do you have these subject 
 pe is okay but english as 
 one-word but music i don't know uhm i
don't know how to play the piano or this kind of in uh
music instrument 
so they don't i think they won't consider me as a
music teacher
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 ask 
oh i see
uhm when you enter uhm when you become a teacher are you accepted
as for like only one subject teacher or or you can teach many other
subjects 
i think i want to teach more subjects
 as it will be more it will be too boring 
 just for just teach one subject
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm i see 
i think that i think the the little children is very cute
 as i have been a temporary teacher for 
one one or two days in a primary school
 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
oh really
why why
did you have a programme to teach 
uh no uh when i ' m in when i ' m
after the form seven examination uh i find the
summer job
but before my summer job start i have some 
some time some some uh spare time
so uhm as before before my found the summer job i ' ve
 work uh phone to some primary school uh to know
whether they have some temporary teacher vacancy
 as i want to uh experience to be a teacher
 and also to learn to earn some money in 
the summer 
so i just uh being a primary teacher for one day as i have to
 work as another summer job
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
wow so what did you teach on that only day that one day 
uh just teach the chinese and the as some civil
 civil civil subject about the society uhm just teach
 uh primary three and primary five
 
 uhm 
uhm
so uhm to be a primary school teacher you do not 
have to have a degree you can just 
 uhm 
 i know that so it may they may think us
overeducated 
so the chance may not be too great
 
 oh 
oh it ' s interesting because it ' s different in japan because you
have to have a degree to become a teacher in any stage
any uhm any school or any level
so it ' s really and also you have to have special education 
 in education to become a teacher 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
for me in fact i want to be a teacher and then to study at at
the spare time to study another diploma or degree course about
education
 
 uhm uhm 
uhm 
so it ' s 
for me i like this kind of job as to uh work with people 
and also the working time is stable and also i can travel every year
 laughs 
 
 uhm uhm 
yes you have a long vacation 
and i also think that maybe after i married 
 i can also have my career but as a business 
women maybe i have to give up something 
 to to make a balance between your family and the 
career
 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
yeah
uh i think school teacher is really a good job because you have a
lot of spare time
 you can do a lot of things after school after you ' ve
finished and after the job time
 what time does school end in primary school
is it 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uh it ' s start and at september and then
 you you mean you mean in the each year or
 
 uh 
 no 
 no the the day time 
 the school ' s time 
most uhm most of the most of the primaries school now
is half day uh from eight o'clock to about one o'clock
but in in res recently uhm some
primary school have a one whole day lesson
maybe i think eight from eight o'clock to three o'clock 
 half half past three
 
 day time 
 uh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
do you have school on saturday too 
yes half day in a saturday
yes but alternative 
alternative saturday
