good evening and welcome to newsline
legco last week voted down the motion calling on chief executive to
fire his special assistant andrew lo
but another legislator martin lee tends a move a revolution calling
on legco to set up its own investigation into the matter
later in the programme after talking about the andrew lo issue we ' ll
discuss what hong kong can learn from the us presidential election
with us tonight are two legislators margaret ng who proposes the
andrew lo motion and howard young who oppose it
welcome both of you
uh before starting the programme i wanted to let both of you know
that we invited andrew lo to appear on newsline and unfortunately he turned
us down
now margaret why did you move this motion 
uhm uhm what about an overdeveloped the sense of duty
i mean to be serious uh academic freedom is a very important issue
it is something protected by the basic law uh what the
university does with it is the university ' s business
but even the executive interferes with that du that that
the freedom then legco has a duty and the power to intervene
uhm the the matter at the time caused a lot of public concern
there was an investigation panel the panel made an extremely
serious uh judgment on andrew lo
and that was widely accepted by the public
now at that time because there was no legislative council in
existent uh or at least no legco members in existent nothing could be done
about it 
so as soon as a new legco convince and i think it is it is
right to take up the matter
 
 uhm 
uhm but you know the chief executive are defended uh andrew lo and
said that uh he thought he was uh an honest person even though the panel said
he he was uh not a trueful witness 
 well that ' s particular uh uh particularly
because he said so
i think many people took exception to it it uh at the time
because here ' s the panel who was seen to be fair very open 
transparen everybody heard the evidence
and at the end of this careful investigation has having listen to
many people the panel came to such a a rational uh conclusion on the analysis
of the evidence and all the chief executive did was to dismiss the whole
thing by saying well i know the man he ' s honest
 and i ' m going to to uh uhm keep him even if he has
lost uh if even if the public in the public uh he has lost uh credibility
 
 uhm 
now howard why did you and the members of the liberal party all
vote against it 
well we had been observing and taking interest in this issue
since this summer uh not just prime to the motion itself 
and uh during the whole one-word we did notice
that the university had its enquiry had to report
and even at that time uh the liberal party did not make any
hard statement one way or the other
i mean uh i think as far liberal party is concern we would probably
uh took uh uh soften stance on the whole issue uh without making rash
 statement on uh you should do this or what i would do if i were the
chief executive crazy statements like that
uh so uh when the motion was debating in legco last week it we
after consideration and taking account what we have thought since the summer
and we thought that this was the well really uh it should uh be a
telling of a long two-words 
and we felt that on ons uh enough was one-word
uh let things rash uh we uh did not support the move to
call on the chief executive fire one of his assistant 
 just because of this matter
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm margaret you must have known even before the vote that you are
going to lose because uh i think the liberal party the democratic
alliance for the betterment of hong kong and the hong kong progressive
alliance all made it known they would vote against it
 uh but you uh persisted anyway
do you feel that you achieve anything 
 uhm 
well that ' s why from the uh my answer to your first question was
it
perhaps it was uh an overdeveloped sense of duty
it is just that when there is a very strong public feeling uh on a
very important issue
i think it is not right just to let it uh drop just because i think
that i was not going to get the vote
uh the the uh legco has a duty to dis discuss these things
to make sure that the public sentiment is reflected in the council
and the i think it was uh uh a surprisingly keen debate i think i
counted besides myself and the secretary for civil service are total of
twenty five legco members who who ' s spoken on the motion
that means that even at this state there was a lot of
strong feelings about it and i don't think that you could just let the matter
drop because there are serious uh principle involved about
for example how we look at the the uh uh accountability of government whether
we accept that the the chief executive can do what he 
 likes 
 
 uhm 
 uh 
 well uh you you mention strong 
feeling but clearly this strong feeling is mo mostly uh on the other
side
they were not on your side because the you know your motion was
heavily uh defeated
now you mention uh accountability i notice that the 
one-word of the executive council uh c y leung had a letter to the
editor in the south china morning post on saturday
uh saying that when the chief executive talk about the
accountability he was talking about policy secretaries and directors of
bureaus and and and that you and and he thought you were
uh mistaken to uh use this issue in the uh andrew lo affair 
 yeah 
 yes 
 uh no
uh i i think uh that is why my motion was not a motion of
non-confidence against uh mr andrew lo because he ' s not a policy 
secretary 
uh we thought that uh at least personally i thought that this is a
matter for the chief executive that ' s why my motion call
upon the chief executive to terminate mr andrew lo ' s appointment as his
senior assistant
now what it what else it uh mr andrew lo is supposed to do is not
a matter for me
but when he has lost cred public credibility then it is
not right for the chief executive to keep this person in that
post that that was of the the focus of my motion
i don't agree with you that the strong feeling was against me
because if you talk about legco uh i think there was strong feeling
in favour of my motion
but if you talk about the public i think overwhelmingly the public
was als also on my side
unfortunately they could not be tested the right way in legco but
still that doesn't uh uh uh that that doesn't mean that we shouldn't discuss
it
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
howard do you think that margaret has a point that andrew lo has
lost all credibility and therefore he cannot be effective anyway 
well i think uh certainly judging from the report of the
hong kong university uh enquiry 
uh i would go as far as said that he has probably lost
credibility in fact of those people on the enquiry otherwise they wouldn't
 make such uh one-word remarks
but uhm we we look at uh andrew lo lo ' s uh function and job as
special aim to the chief executive as a whole
i mean uh we and i believe many political part parties or
politicians in hong kong uhm they do have on connotation
 to have contact with him either when you want to bring something to
attention of the chief executive or one-word discuss
matter general
uhm it i i don't see how the hong kong university uh
 one-word uh you know directly in one-word
 on all of the other functions at him for 
 so that ' s that ' s for
well anyway uh uh i i like all his one-word
 point uh margaret explain that uh it was an
overwhelming sense of public duty that to raise the motion i would add but i
think every single member uhm in legco also shares an overwhelming sense
of public duty
it everyone who sat there and voted and spoke or did
 not spoke and we listen to other people who ' s spoke
and i think from the little party ' s point of view we certainly
have no personal reason or particularly reason to favour uhm mr lo or
yes or no
but i uh we decide in the end of one-word that
we should not use uh legco motion to uh ask or put pressure on chief 
executive tell him to fire one of his own staff
i mean what we uh think of the merits and demerits of the staff
might might be another person per and uh but of course we we did not
choose to one-word that in public either 
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 oh yeah i think i think so i i 
 yeah 
 
 uhm 
 had have you had any dealings with uh mr lo you
you own personally 
uh yes uh i first met mr lo in fact before the transition
 uh uh that was in there is one i was member of the
preparatory committee
 uh and the selection committee in fact uh uh on one
occasion i sat next to him at lunch
and i have the time i recall uh i raise three topics with him and
ask uh one all all more or less tourism related topics
one ares one was uh allow more taiwanese visitors
to come to hong kong
one was uh tourism in hong kong and one was the high airport charge
in hong kong
and i said look if you can do anything to pass these concerns on
the chief executive and have haven't look into these matters
it can only be good for the transition and uh in fact as
 far as those issue and he he he he he 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 and 
 that impress you favourably 
well uh he ' s a very low key person i i did not i do not
known personally but i did had a at least uh one occasion to meet him
he doesn't speak much he listens more than he speaks
and of course whenever we see him we hope that he
would listen rather than speaks 
 
 uhm 
 i see 
but do you have a favourable impression of him 
uh it difficult to how it it he is not my staff
i can only judge on one or two uh occasions uhm uh
i i i ' m judging him i can only say that he is a very low key 
person and i ' m 
honestly i have not heard him speak much i only observed him 
 listening and taking down notes
 
 uhm 
 uh 
 uhm 
 right 
 now margaret have you had any dealings with 
 no i have no dealing with mr andrew lo
not never met him no
 
 you never met him 
uhm so you you haven't formed any impression of uh him 
personally 
 no i have no personal ground against
him
i i either think that uh i i mean there was some i i don't know
one of of of the uh uh members said that uh i may have uh personal dislike of
him
it ' s uhm it is not a personal dislike at all
but i think like other members of the public i have watched the uh
his evidence on camera
i have since then uh ask for the excerpt that the
video tape of his evidence
i ' ve i have looked at the the record of his evidence
i ' ve checked that against the the report of the panel
i think the panel ' s judgment was extremely uh their comment was
extremely fair
uh and i think uh in fact a various a very mild
one but even this very mild one to be call a poor and untrueful
 witness particularly untrueful 
 i giving evidence of of a one-word
 version that ' s a very serious matter 
someone and i think the public was very concern about the fact
that someone appears to be going about to other people using uh what is the
personal authority of the chief executive
because in this line of of of uh uhm uh uhm dealings uhm
obviously the vice-chancellor of the university thought that he
was a messenger from the chief executive whether he was express his
 instruct or not
 so the public is concern about this personal use
of personal uh authority 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 right 
 okay we ' ll we ' ll have to take a break 
here 
don't go away we ' ll right back commercial break 
welcome back
we ' re talking about andrew lo the chief executive special
assistant
and uh howard uh i understand that opinion surveys show that uh
majority of the public want to see andrew lo fired
uh if that ' s the case why is the liberal party against public
opinion 
 yeah 
oh i knew we don't make up our minds on how to vote and what
to say in legco base on opinion surveys on one or two newspapers
we try to look at the issue and also consider what uh our
stance uh stance is uh on on this issue
and what we regard is the best public uh interest
of course public opinion surveys is uh is is one thing that want
may to take to come but that is not the one-word 
uhm but i would like to add uh this point that uh since just
 one-word of us here at least i have met the man on i
would say at least two occasions
and it was mention just now that uhm uhm whether he is a messenger
of the chief executive or not i i would only add on the two occasions i
met him
he hardly said anything uh it he him to me if he said he was a
messenger i would say he would probably more a message for us to
convey our views to the chief executive rather than the other
way 
but uh i uh i i i think uhm uh as for uhm his his own performance
uh in the enquiry i did watch some of the tv clips and resum the
stuff i i i would not one-word to add
that if if if if he would uh an actor he would certainly not win any oscar
award and he ' s sure that he ' s not one-word 
 
 uhm 
 i i mis 
 
 uhm uhm 
 one-word 
 i i ' m talking about oscar uh acting
uh my motion was very fairy and squarely on the loss of of uh
credibility in the pub uh before the public 
and uh uh it ' s not only the surveys which was very strong on that
he should either be be dismissed or or should resign but also editorials i
think that that uh at least i counted at least two english and two chinese
editorials i could have got more who all said that the man has lost public
credibility and the most uh uh appropriate thing to do is for him not to
serve in that post anymore 
 
 uhm 
 i i see that the hong kong government position
 uh in in the uh debate uh was that uh mr lo has not
committed any substantial fault on interfere the university ' s polling work
 and uh being a poor and untrueful 
witness it sound it ' s not sufficient reason for him to be fired
 
 yes 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 exactly 
i mean that that is why it ' s not my motion was not just on one
comment but on on public credibility
and also i think it is uh uh the uh uhm the conclusion that he did
not interfere with academic freedom uh was not consistent
with either his evidence or the report of the panel
uh from the panel uh from the panel ' s report he went on purpose
to see the the vice-chancellor
he told him in advance that he was interested to discuss these uh
public survey polls
uh when he was there he questioned that the uh uh uh the
conflict of interest of the poster 
he asks the university who was responsible and told the university
that uh the university was in some way responsible
i think these were very threatening remarks and
from the evidence of the vice-chancellor obviously it got to the vice-
chancellor
uh and so for these reasons i think it was very proper for the
public to feel very concern
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
now martin lee is going to propose uh the legco set up its own
investigation into the andrew lo matter
uh howard do you think uh that an investigation by legco would
serve any purpose
would the liberal party support this 
well uh uh yes i do understand that uh mr lee will raise a
motion uh we have not discuss our voting uh uh and this it speech on the
motion as yet
but i i believe the liberal party ' s uh stance will be consistent
and uh i do not think we would have any u turns on one-word
 on the matters
even during the summer uh we we had taken the
stance that uh let see what the hong kong university enquiry comes up with
 and what they said
and then afterwards publish uh most of our members we when we
spoke to them not very formally but it ' s one-word
 your wind we thought it to be two-words 
 
 but it ' s not a u turn 
 uhm 
 well i i don't see how uh i don't see how 
gathering additional information
the supporting the gathering of ad additional
information is making a u turn
in if if uh enough information is new information is gathered you
may uh even just like that there is sufficient reason to
dismiss him 
 i ' m one-word what 
 well when when i ' m saying that i ' m making 
you i was referring to fact that uh i did notice that during last week ' s
debates uh there was some one-word not involving our
party but between two other parties
one was accusing other some members having u turn what
 they said
 but i think if you look through what liberal party
members up to this point in time have said uh i we have had not uh any
members calling for a formal select committee on this issue
 about we have had we have had individual members
saying that well we think the the matter has 
been clear that we should thought it was end there
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 i i stills that ' s 
 i think i think the 
 i think he is also uh uh 
 
 uhm 
 yeah two-words
