and then leave hong kong on the fifteen of may  uh so where are you going to   i ' m going to travelling  travelling   yes  where   uh all over asia  asia how about china and taiwan   uh china not taiwan though  uh   what do you do in this summer olive  summer i probably find jobs   find jobs what kind of jobs  maybe some kind of jobs related to the customer services   uh you want to work in customer services  yes you know i ' m too talkative i like to talk to people and so i want to find such kind of job   what do you like to talk to people about  anything better   an anything  yeah   you just really enjoy conversation  yes i like to talk to you too   oh i see two-words nice uhm so what about you how ' s your school going  actually i ' m too busy because i have a lot of papers to work on   yeah how many papers do you have  three more   three more  yeah because uhm two projects and one essay   yeah  yeah   yeah how are they going  uhm actually not bad but     not bad not good  not good because i do not have mu enough time to complete all of them i think   yeah have you been working very hard lately  yes i slept very very little last night   how many hours did you sleep last night  four hours   four hours yeah you need to sleep tonight quite long  yes but i have uh private tutoring tonight   oh what ' s that private tutoring what is that  private tutoring actually i have to you know to help the children to study help their homework   what kind of things do you teach them  uhm just like english and mathematics    yeah  english and mathematics  yes because they  normally they find difficulties in these two areas   oh really  yes and you have you been a private tutor before   uh yes i have taught some spanish before  spanish in     yes  spanish  uh you know spanish   yes i know spanish  uh actually i don't like i don't know spanish i ' ve just know uhm cantonese english and mandarin but i ' m weak in mandarin   you weak in mandarin  yes because you know it ' s difficult to for the for the tone i think it ' s difficult to get the sense of the tones of mandarin   yeah uhm how old is the tutor the the students you ' re tutoring  uhm she she ' s just uh twelve years old   uhm  very young   and she does she enjoy school or how does she find school  uh she enjoys going to school  because she has a lot of friends there she often tells me uhm how the school is going on and uh she will introduces her friends to me yes    yes  oh that sounds very good what about uh si like what kind of grades does she get  above average not the top one but you know quite well   oh that ' s good does she find school uh to be a lot of pressure i hear in hong kong the students are under a great deal of pressure from their parents to get good grades  i think luckily uhm her parents uh do not give her so much pressure because uhm they think uh th she should it ' s better for her to study by her own self and to enjoy studying so that ' s better but i know for other parents it ' s not the case they often think children should uhm work hard and to get higher marks in order to get into a good school   so do they pressure their children quite a bit  yes because of the competition in hong kong you know they have to complete with each other in order to get in into a better school so i think because of the competition so they have to work hard in order to get higher marks   uhm well tut  what do you think about all of this you think it ' s a good system does hong kong have a good educational system or does it need some changes  i think it needs some changes as well so because you know the education system here makes children feel very very afraid of their studies   afraid of failure  yeah afraid of failure   what will they do if they feel like they fail  maybe suicide   suicide  yeah have you heard about it   uhm yeah i ' ve heard that happens on occasion is it a real problem in hong kong  yes it ' s a real problem i think especially for those uhm lower form students like uhm thirteen or fourteen years old students   really there ' s students that young committing suicide  because they think it ' s a way for them to escape from  from the problem from the pressure of school   yes  they think it ' s a way for them to escape from the reality so you know it ' s it ' s not a good phenomenon in hong kong   oh that ' s a bad phenomenon  yes how about in canada   uh i don't think there ' s that kind of problems is much uhm school is difficult and their pressure does exist put on students from their parents but i think it ' s a little more one-word  healthy environment  uhm uh is it because you know the competition is not as serious as in hong kong   well the competition is quite serious there also uh it ' s difficult to get into university but i don't think anybody will commit suicide or see that as a proper way of of getting out of out of the problems so i don't know it ' s the competition as a problem in hong kong or it ' s the pressure put on the kids by their parents or what i will need to look into a little more and ask some more questions  actually i think uhm the problem is not just from the parents because schools often you know teach children uhm from the textbook they think they should remember what the teachers told them so i think schools should be responsible for that problem too because of the education system and i think uhm it ' s time for them to have a change   yeah yeah   actually i worked a a paper uhm proposing to change the existing education system and to evaluate the the exist existing system as well   yeah that sounds very good tell me olive when you are a little girl and when you are growing up in  this hong kong educational system did you feel a great deal of pressure on yourself  yes actually especially when i uhm when it ' s time for me to enter into the secondary school i have to get high marks in order to you know in order to get into a good school i have to uhm to join the public examination as well it ' s it ' s not you know i ' m afraid of it a lot   uh so did you said you study very very hard  yes i have to study a a bit because uhm actually it ' s not testing my english or chinese or or  mathematics as well it tests students uhm just like an aptitude test aptitude test so they have to get higher marks they test their logic such kind of things so we had to practise a lot before we enter the examination   uhm tut  well did you get a chance to play some sports when you ' re growing up too  or have hobbies or go out with your friends you didn't have to study all the time  uhm actually i don't like sport i don't like sports i like maybe badminton but i do not play it well so i don't like sport   wow when you are teenager what did you do in your spare time besides study  uhm watching dramas   oh yeah what kind of dramas did you watch  i like you know just uhm what kind musicals   musicals  yup   what musicals have you seen  uh just like uhm singing in the rain   oh yeah singing in the rain  it ' s very nice   yeah very nice  and operas just like phantom of the operas   uh yeah yeah   yeah yeah   it ' s very nice   i like that kind of you know performance   yeah have you ever done any performance yourself  no i joined the drama society  but but i ' m not an active member    yeah  okay  because i you know i i enjoy being in the catholic society  much more    okay  oh yes you are catholic aren't you  yes and you     how long  how long have you been a catholic  five years   what made what made you become a catholic  oh it ' s difficult to explain    yeah  oh too difficult  yeah but you know i experience the love from god because i think he take cares of me in all aspects as well not just my feeling not just my experiences but even i think he he gives me some clues to show that he is actually existing in the world   yeah  yeah and from other ' s love    how  that sounds very nice  and you have you ever been to the church or join any mass or  any other activities   yes i ' ve been involved in uh a few different churches over the years uh when i was a kid i was in united church and then we moved away from the the united church and went to uh one-word church for a while and then when i lived in mexico i went to catholic church for a while because my girlfriend was catholic at that time  and then right now i don't really go

study law alright i study law now yeah  and before   before i study commerce  commerce   yeah   uh  business  so you do want to be a businessman    business   yeah  yeah i i think so  uh so why do you study law right now   uhm well it ' s a very complicated subject  uhm it ' s because of your parents   what  they want they expect you or they want you to study law or or just your own interest    what  what makes you think that olive  i know they they are very you know they they are very academic they are very professional maybe they want you to be professional too   yeah they indeed put quite a bit of pressure on me so i understand what it feels like to have pressure put on you in school  yeah tut  and you study business before compared with business do you like it or do you like law more   i really like business more be honest with you law is uh an interesting subject but i don't know that ' s part one-word that i just don't think that i want to be involved in  uhm and i think the law system is always changing you have to you know keep pace with it   yeah the law system is changing uh   coughs  sorry and you have to know what ' s going on uh tut  the practice of law is kind of a very uh tough business and i don't i don't know if this is a very good topic of conversation  uhm yes i don't know much about law too     it ' s  it ' s just that there are certain aspects of law that uh the practice of law that uh i don't think i really want to be involved in uhm tut i know you want to study a a master course in the future it ' s environmental law is it   yeah maybe in environmental studies  environmental studies   i ' m starting to think of moving away from things that i ' ve studied already just because i don't think they ' re for me  and moving towards science
