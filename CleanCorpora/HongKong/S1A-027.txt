but why did you choose mathematics for your   studies 
""
""
""
 uhm   i think  uh it is my interesting
""
i love  ma  uh mathematics but now  i don't think so
""
because it is so difficult it  ' s   so  difficult a
subject to handle 
""
yeah so many uh assignment    
""
yeah so many test     yeah
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm  uhm like  in the future like after you graduate what

""
""
i don't know
 
""
you don't know 
""
""
maybe teacher but i don't like to
""
most people suppose i want to be a teacher so i choose  mathema
 uh  matics  to study     but i don't think so
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
why not why don't you want to  uhm become a teacher 
""
""
uhm maybe  i i  ' m not a patient girl 
 laughs  i don't know how to teach the student    yeah 
 
""
 uh   but  i don't think you have to be patient 
""
""
uhm i think  you must be patient
 
""
really 
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 or   do you like children or you don't really like 
 children  
""
""
 uhm   a little bit
 
""
a little bit   what 
""
you don't like them that much 
""
""
 yeah  
""
uh yeah i don't like them so much    maybe  uh i  ' m
the youngest  in my family   
""
so  i  i  ' m seldom to uh  to  how to speak in english
uh to play with the  uh the the younger   yeah so  
""
i don't know how to  uh build up the relationship and how to 
play them
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh  
""
 uh yeah yeah i understand  
""
with the younger ones
""
yeah so i remember that you have a older brother was it   a
 older  brother  
""
""
 yeah one   older brother and one older sister 
 
""
yeah 
""
what about you   uh you  ' re  you are single uh
 
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
yeah   i  ' m the  only child   in my family
yeah  yep
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 you  ' re only child yeah  
""
""
don't you  one-word  you  lonely
""
""
lonely   yes 
 
""
 lonely   uh no no because  i i 
""
maybe people who have  brothers and sisters don't 
understand this feelings but because i  ' ve  i only  been the only child
for my whole life   
""
so  there  ' s   no time  that they have innocent
comparison   so  it  ' s okay
""
  it  ' s fine  so it  ' s fine yeah 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 no comparison  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
but you think it is difficult to  uhm to build up relationship
with the other people
 
""
uhm no it  ' s okay
""
i don't  think i have any difficulties so far
""
but maybe   because  i  ' m always used to have the
full attention all the time     yeah 
 laughs 
""
  so maybe  when uhm like people don't really 
uhm like  care about me so much i i feel  little bit uncomfortable on
those   times
""
but  usually it  ' s okay   
""
yeah i  think it  ' s more it depends more on your character
than    how your are  uh your family
""
it depends more yeah on your character than your family  
 yeah  
""
so uhm so during the chinese new year are you going to celebrate
it with you family
""
are you going to have dinner outside   or  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uncomfortable  
""
 usually it  ' s okay  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah   tomorrow
 
""
uh 
""
""
with my dinner with my family   
""
yeah  maybe  uhm to  i don't know where we will go 
   yeah
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
do you how many people are going to come
""
is it your     family and your relatives or just
your family 
""
""
 uhm  
""
just families
""
  maybe  uhm one two three four five six seven 
 inclu  me     yeah
""
with   my  uhm  uhm uhm my  brother  ' s
girlfriend     my sister    and  his husband
   yeah  yeah
 
""
 uhm  
""
 awe  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh she  ' s already marry  
""
does she have children 
""
""
no   no children  yet uhm
 
""
 no not yet   
""
uh but is she working too
""
are they both working  your sister and your  hus  and
your sister  ' s husband
""
or is your    sister  like  a housewife or
""
""
 uhm  
""
uh working both working   yeah 
""
uhm so they are so busy   sometimes yeah 
""
i  ' m seldom to see my sister     because uhm we
uhm live separate    uhm 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uh  
""
 yeah   so how old is your sister now 
""
""
twenty maybe twenty  seven or twenty eight right i don't
   i thought 
""
yeah  i don't yeah 
 laughs 
""
  yeah 
 
""
 you don't remember   
 laughs 
""
 uh  
""
so so she  ' s quite older than you
""
  uhm  do you feel like you have difficulties in
talking with her
""
like  because the generation is little bit different i guess
""
""
""
 uhm  
""
uh yeah   i think  so 
""
i don't know why  becau  
""
but i think i  i  would  uh i have a good relationship
  with  my brother more than   my sister  yeah
""
  i  can talk many things with uh with my brothers
  but sometimes  i don't know uh what to say with my sisters
   uhm  uhm
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 your sister   
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh  
""
yeah did she scare you a lot when you  ' re when you  ' re little
""
was she a   very scary   sister or 
 and
 laughs 
""
  she scold  you a lot or 
""
""
 no  
""
 it  ' s not  
""
but no no because i think  uhm my  k  uhm  characters
is different from my sisters   
""
maybe  so similar with my brothers
""
  uh both  because both of us like uh sporting 
 like  uh uhm playing basketball   with the  same
interest   but my  s   sister is uh  uh the other style
    yeah because it  ' s uhm it  ' s uhm  a long pause 
""
my sister is so  thin  and gentle     yeah
 
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh i see  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm  
""
so she  ' s more feminine than you 
""
""
uhm what
 
""
more feminine more girlish 
""
""
what  girl is it 
 
""
girlish 
""
""
oh girlish yeah yeah
 
""
""
 laughs  so uhm do you all do you still play basketball now 
""
""
sometimes
 
""
sometimes 
""
""
i like but i  ' ve no time to play
 
""
uh you  ' re busy with your studies 
""
""
uhm  one of the reason but have  another things 
  yeah 
""
  many  things to do
 
""
 uh okay  
""
 you may  
""
uhm how so what  what do you do on on the weekends here 
""
""
huh weekend     i go to church
 
""
 yep  
""
uh but that  ' s only on sunday right 
""
""
no saturday and sunday
 
""
 do you  why on saturday what do you do
""
  do you have  like school  church school or 
""
""

""
yeah yeah    yeah  s   saturday and sunday
""
and  what we doing uh on saturday we have uhm  some  we  ' ve
 to read bible     yeah on sunday   and  we
have uh some sharing    uhm 
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   i see
""
do you go to church close to your house 
""
""
no it  ' s far away
 
""
uh but why do you   go to a  church so far away 
""
""
 yeah  
""
because  huh it  ' s a long story 
 and
 laugh 
 
""
you so you don't have enough time to talk 
""
""
uh no because uh uh 
""
most people are  most my brothers and sisters uhm  maybe
they  study in hong kong u    
""
and  they also  uh go to the same church   
""
so  that  ' s why i choose the  uh the church   
 yeah
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
so is your    home  is your  family all
christians or 
""
""
 it  ' s it  ' s your  
""
except my  uh my father    yeah  except my
father   uhm 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   so when so when did you start go to church
""
""
""
oh where   uh 
 
""
 when   did you   start  to go to church
   ever since  you   remember or  
""
""
 when  
""
 uhm  
""
 maybe  s   
""
maybe uh six years ago  yeah
 
""
did you have any reason that you start to go any any   
anything happen  
""
""
 of course   i think i think uhm the the jesus is
a god    
""
yeah i believe in him uhm  uh he can  give me a sense of uh
peace and comfortable and  uh the god can listen  listen to me 
  yeah 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 but when    when you first went to church when
well when was the first time you read the bible then 
""
""
i beg your pardon
 
""
when was your first time you read the bible 
""
""
when
 
""
yeah 
""
""
uhm maybe  s  six years ago     uh the
exact date i forgot    yeah 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 so   who introduce you to    the bible
and the church  
 laughs  
""
""
 my uhm   my sister  ' s friend
""
yeah because my sister is also a christian     uh
uh her friend is a christian
""
so uh he uh invite me to go to church    
""
but uhm first of all i always refuse  her    
""
but sometimes i think uhm  it is so  it is  make  uh
make her is uncomfortable   uh  while i  re  uh refuse her
   
""
so i uhm  i promise  uh her that i go with you once 
 just once  
""
yeah but yeah after one after i go i think uhm  i have some
interest     yeah
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha just once  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
so after then you continue to   go to church  
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
of course uh  the mainly reason is the  i know the truth
    yeah
""
  what  about you
""
  do  you believe in  one-word  uh
jesus
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 okay  
""
 uh  
""
i  ' m not really but i  ' ve always been to a christian school so
  i  ' m  
""
""
 why  
""
why you why you go uh here uh there
 
""
why do i go to christian school 
""
""
yeah
 
""
uhm there  ' s no particular reason but uhm there  ' s many in japan
""
most of the private schools are christian school   
""
""
and because i chose to go to a private school    
uhm  so and somehow it just was a christian school
""
so there  ' s no deep reason and i guess it  ' s because uhm my
mother     has always  uhm been to a christian school too
   
""
so it  ' s kind of   a family  tradition   
yeah  
""
""
 uh uh uh  
""
 uh uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 oh  
""
 i see  
""
 uh uh uh  
""
family tradition
 
""
yeah 
 laughs     yeah  so   
""
uhm  there  ' s no really deep reason that i chose to go 
  one 
""
but  i guess also because i  ' m quite familiar to the
christian culture
""
i mean the christian    
""
yeah because i lived in the state when i was a child  
 so i  ' ve   been to the church quite often  one-word
 uhm several times now more than several times    
""
uhm ever since i was a little child so 
""
""
 okay  family tradition  yeah  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 christian culture  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm do you think bible is true
 
""
uhm it  ' s a hard question
""
i  don't know because   i don't really  believe
""
i i think if you believe i think it  ' s true
""
  if you don't  believe it  ' s not
""
so it  ' s a very hard question    yeah  
""
""
 you don't know  
""
 uh yeah  
""
 uhm but   you know  man  uh so many uh bible
story    
""
do you think uh jesus is a a people
 
""
 yeah  
""
a person 
""
""
uh yeah yeah a person
""
  is jesus a person 
""
you you  you think uh he is a person
 
""
 yeah yeah yeah i do  
""
well he was a   person right  
""
""
 uh uh he   was a person   yeah 
 
""
 yeah  
""
but now   one-word  it  ' s a hard question
""
i guess 
 laughs  it  ' s    it  ' s really  difficult to answer 
 laughs  
""
""
 uh ha ha  
""
""
why i think  i really want to know uh what do you think
about jesus
 
""
well i think if you  ' re christian of course he  ' s  he  ' s like
 someone you believe in
""
but if you  ' re like a non-christian actually it doesn't really
matter that much    
""
yeah so even if i  ' m familiar with  the bible  and with
jesus
""
but it  ' s something different   and it  ' s also  uh
something different in the japanese culture too     yeah 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
do you  bray 
 
""
do i pray no 
""
""
pray   do you   you don't pray   
never  never pray
 
""
 no  
""
 no  
""
never pray 
""
""
oh
""
but sometimes  do you think uh uhm while you are upset  
and or  unhappy but how to uh solve this problem and how to face this
situation
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm somehow ever since i was a child i always  kind of solved
it  by myself
""
just talk to myself   or  
""
""
 talk   talk
""
you talk yourself   talk your 
 
""
 talk    talk to myself   yeah  
""
""
 oh  
""
uh but now but now how to solve this problem
 
""
still i talk to myself 
""
""
you talk to yourself
 
""
yeah  uh it is just like   as you pray  
""
""
 what content   did you talk
""
  what content is that  
""
just comfort yourself
 
""
 just just just talk  
""
yeah   just  talk and say 
""
i don't know just 
 laughs   talk
""
it  ' s so    easy   
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 i i   do that too
 
""
yeah   yeah  
""
""
 you    talk 
""
""
yeah it  ' s useful
 
""
yeah   useful 
""
you just talk to yourself
""
it  ' s just   it it  no  it is same as you pray it  ' s
  
""
it  ' s the same thing      yeah 
""
it  ' s just that we  i mean not we but i  believe in
something in myself 
""
""
 use  
""
 i never talk to myself  
""
 i pray i just pray i pray to my god  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
you believe in yourself   you  think
 
""
 yes   something    that  
""
""
 i think   you should uh you can handle by
yourself do you think
 
""
not handle by myself   but  i believe in something
inside   myself  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm   inside myself
 
""
so it  ' s like  my own god my   own    in
inside  in in inside  myself yeah    
""
so it  ' s not me that i  ' m talking to actually but i  ' m talking to
someone 
 laughs  somewhere inside myself 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 maybe it is my your your your own god  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
do you think  do you think uh uhm that something uh uh there  ' s
something is god    
""
do you think so
 
""
 uh  
""
i don't know but it  ' s    uh  
""
yeah i guess so
""
it  ' s it  ' s   but    h  
 laughs 
""
but if  if i have to say it  ' s god it  ' s it  ' s  differ 
different 
""
""
 just a  sound  is it  
""
 it is  
""
uh uh is   it 
 
""
 but   but it  ' s  it  ' s something special i guess
inside me 
""
""
but if after you as uh you talk to yourself   
 maybe you uh you will become uh  comfortable and nothing happen
""
just you can   recover 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 oh i feel   more comfortable 
""
""
you feel more   comfortable 
""
""
 yeah 
 
""
 yes  
""
i feel like someone was  listening to me 
""
i don't know who but someone was listen to me    so 
""
""
""
 yeah i   feel that someone can help me  
too 
 
""
 yeah   yeah 
""
""
i i think    your  concept  uh both of you
 think that uh  uh  something  exist  maybe god but you don't
know uh  that something is god
 
""
 so i think  
""
  yeah  
""
""
 oh   that  ' s not as uh necessary
""
we we we just uhm   want to 
""
""
 but you  
""
but if you uh  uh but if  if you do not think it is god but
 who can help you
 
""
it doesn't matter who   helps     
""
it  ' s   just like  self-satisfaction 
 laughs  
""
""
 it doesn't  
""
""
 yeah it doesn't matter 
""
""
 it doesn't matter  
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah   exactly 
""
yeah
""
""
 oh  
 
""
yeah   so  it  ' s not that i don't believe that 
that   jesus  exists
""
it  ' s not that i don't believe in him
""
  it  ' s just  that i don't  i don't  like
devote to him like i don't   believe   everything  
 
""
i  have something  different from him inside me  
 so  it  ' s not that i 
""
uhm so  that  uh so that i don't believe
""
it  ' s not that i don't believe in him
""
it  ' s just that i just  don't think he  ' s the only person 
  or  the only god 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
only only   god 
 
""
 yeah  
""
the only son of  one-word  i don't   
 so i think that  ' s the difference 
""
""
 uh ha  
""
oh this the different
 
""
yeah so i  i do understand  the bible   
""
i  do read it sometimes
""
i mean    not   by myself but because i
always have the chance   and i always  have friends  
around me that  read so    
""
but i  don't know i just don't strongly believe in it
""
i don't really     yeah
""
but uhm i guess it  ' s  yeah a matter of difference 
different experience    three words   yeah
""
""
""
 uh ha  
""
 you you read it sometimes  
""
 uhm uhm uh  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
i heard you mention that you  you went to private school
right private school
 
""
yeah 
""
""
private   school 
""
""
 yeah   will will  will  will  will there
uhm much difference between private school and public school
 
""
uhm  yeah  public schools  uhm because they they go on
the curriculum of the  the  like the the the the the the japanese 
education ministry has held
""
so   it  ' s like  a really  standard curriculum
but if you go to private school
""
each private school has its own curriculum  and the one that i
went to was because it was a christian school
""
and also be  and it was like  found by americans
""
uhm our school had like more  extra english  program 
uhm  programmes not classes    special   curriculum
""
or we had more freedom in the choice of   ask  we 
could  like uhm  decide our own curriculum
""
i mean our schedule by ourselves  or uhm 
""
or because it was like a christian school we had  like once a
week we had this bible reading time or   we had  to go to church
every  every saturday or i mean sunday
""
or  eac  each school has its like a different 
characteristic
""
but if it  ' s a public school all of them are almost the same
almost you know more or less the same 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
so are those  pri  uh private school uhm has had a
goodwill or it  ' s    has  many  many bad students
""
""
 probably  
 
""
oh no no no no no
""
uhm it depends on which private school you go to 
""
""
but    this uh   in general
""
""
 i think  
 
""
uh no there  ' s no in general 
""
""
no in general
 
""
because in japan there  ' s so many schools
""
even in  pri  in public and private  uhm 
""
uh if if it even  if it  ' s like  a public school
""
there  ' s good public school and really bad public school
""
in private schools there  ' s really good private schools and
really bad public school    
""
so it really depends  on which you choose 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
but in hong kong i think the private school is uhm  it  ' s for
the  pe  uh for the student uh uh  who uh who    and is uh
who   the  bad yeah
""
""
 got bad results  
 
""
uhm it just depends 
""
""
academic result is  is not good   
""
so they  choose a private school   to study 
 
""
 uhm what  
""
 uh  
""
yeah because usually in japan like uhm if you go to higher
private schools
""
it  ' s because if it  ' s a private school you have to pay more
""
that means you come from a relatively wealth wealthy family 
 
""
so  it means usually if you come from wealthy family have
more you have better education 
""
so  and so you belong to this kind of more wealthy class 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
oh
""
""
it sounds like uhm in hong kong
""
we classify those schools as international schools   
""
""
  and that  ' s very  expensive   and 
though uhm private schools   very  expensive too
""
but they enjoy uhm bad credits 
 laughs 
""
yeah   they  ' re   notorious for uh producing 
""
 laughs  trouble  trouble   students 
""
""
 yeah yeah 
 
""
 uh   
""
""
 international school  what is   
""
 yeah  
""
 private  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah   yeah   trouble  students 
 yeah 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 uh yeah   it it  ' s it  ' s really not that way in
japan
""
it  it really depends even if uh like public schools
""
there  ' s really bad public schools like you don't  have to
take  exam 
""
you just go you just graduate
""
this they like the the teachers want  just want to kick you
out as soon as possible   
""
and  uhm but like the one that i went to
""
uhm since i  ' ve been there since secondary school   
so  i  to enter the university i didn't have to take any  exams
""
""
  uhm   because the the high school it  ' s like a
prep-school
""
it  ' s like attached to the  university  so it  ' s a little
bit different from here
""
uhm  but anyway i didn't have to take the   ex  
entrance  exam  for the university    
""
i could just directly go to the university   without
 any  exams  you know 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 secondary  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
without any  exam 
 
""
without any  exams 
""
so some  s   so other students from other high schools
had to take the  exam  to enter    a  university but i
didn't have   to  
""
""
 uh ha  
""
 why   because    uh 
 
""

 a  certain secondary school     which  yeah so
   
""

yeah
