<I>
uhm i live in kowloon uh in choi wan estate
 
yeah but you you go to hong kong u
isn't that a long 
yes it takes me uh about an hour to go to school and an hour to
go back home
 
yeah what time do you finish school 
finish
uhm tut it ' s different everyday
because sometimes i have lesson at one o'clock
and then uh the les les the lesson ends at five
 and sometimes it ends at twelve so it ' s flexible
 
 yeah 
oh so what ' s your school like 
my school uh uhm 
it ' s big uh larger than my secondary school
and there are uh different kinds of people
it ' s very different from the secondary school 
because uhm there is all types of people like uh foreigners 
and there are all professors and lecturers
 
 oh 
yeah what course you take 
uhm actually i major in history and english
and in addition i have to take some uh courses which are not
offered in my faculty
 
uh so what do you want to be when you grow up 
 laughs 
i never thought of that before
 
but what what can you do with the courses you ' re taking
 
 uh actually i uh i ' m in the art faculty
i think i can uh engage in careers like teaching uhm uh
journalism or publishing
 
do do you like kids 
 or government post
uhm
 
do you like kids 
kids
uh if if they are good i i i i like them
but if they are naughty uh all speakers laugh 
 
how about when you grow up
would do you want to have children 
children 
 laughs 
 
yeah they when when you grow up 
uhm i think to be a parents uh is a great
responsibility
 and i think i can't be a very good mother
so tut i don't know i i want to have a children
 
i uh i want to have a to to have child but tut uhm
it ' s too far away
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
yeah 
yeah and tut yeah i yeah
 
where where do you want to live when you ' re a bit older when
you finish university
are you going to stay here or 
uhm probably i would not leave hong kong
because hong kong is my home
 
you you want to stay here 
yes
i i never uhm think of uh emigration or something
i will stay in hong kong and probably live with my family
 
 uh 
uhm 
yeah

no
 
no 
yeah
because no money all speakers laugh 
yeah i want to go to europe or the usa but uhm it costs me a lot
 
yeah you like travelling 
yes i think everybody likes travelling 
because uhm tut you can experience different kinds of
uhm life style
and you can see a lot of things
 
 yeah 
how was china 
uhm after i ' ve been to the xian
uh my impression of china changes 
because uh in the past i always think that uhm the chinese
uh although i am a chinese but uh to be honest i don
 quite like the chinese
because i uh i think they are tut uhm bit uh old
fashion in the ways of thinking 
and i don't know i i just don't i just i just think that they
are not modern
yeah so i don't like them
but uh after i ' ve been to xian i my my impression changes
i think uhm they are nice person
 
 uhm uhm 
 oh 
 yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah uh very nice

 yeah 
do do you get all well with with your family

yeah do you get along well or sometimes you fighten 
uh no fight
 
no no no fight 
 no fight uhm but sometimes i think uhm the
communication is not enough
 
yeah 
yeah because every everybody is busy
 
yeah
 so what do you do when i don't know like after
school or something 
 yeah 
uhm tut in my first year at the university 
uh i joined a society which is history society
 to be uh executive committee of the history
society 
yeah and i ' m i was very busy with that society work 
uh for example uh i had to have regular meetings with the other
executive committee uh to discuss uh how we can organize the functions
for our members 
and to deal with other administrative things
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm 
yeah uh and in my second year uhm i finish the
society work
uh and after school time i will take up part-time jobs
yeah and
 
like what what kind of part-time 
 like what uh private tuition and to
 give teaching at a primary school uhm every saturday
 
 oh yeah 
uhm uhm 
and i will have my free time to meet my friends
 
yeah so what do you what do you guys do 
uh uh
uh i will go to church on sunday

you you are christian 
yes
 
christian you 
yes
uh to go to the sunday school

my parents will not have so strict rules for
me 
 
 so that they ' re they are not strict 
not strict
 
they used to be strict or

because uhm when i was a a form three student 
 uh they allowed me to choose my own own subject
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
yeah 
do do you know the education system of hong
kong
that means when you are when you reach uh form three you 
 have to choose whether you uh take art subjects or science
subjects
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
oh really
it it can't be both
it has to be either art or science
 and you chose 
 no 
 yes 
 so 
and i ' m and i chose art
 
uh art
are you good at science 
no
 
no 
i ' m very poor at mathematics and the scientific 
theories so
 
 really 
usually chinese they ' re they ' re very good at uh 
 science and maths 
 uhm 
really
 
yeah uh in my school everyone 
no no no
no but uh most girls uh choose arts
 
yeah 
like like arts subjects language or or
literature or
i don't know that kind of subjects so uh
yes they give me a lot of freedom in choosing or deciding my 
tut future
 
 like

yeah
 
that ' s good 
yeah a long pause
