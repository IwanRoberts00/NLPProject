the arts students take different courses uh    
each year and the combination can be totally different from one student to
another so uhm  we only have a few uh one or two foreigners uh to take uh
 some courses     together and other uh uh just  indi
 individual
""
uhm so uh we met not very often    
""
and  in fact there is not  man  there are not many uh
foreigner students in the arts faculty  because maybe mainly uhm the
reason is uh i major in  english     and foreign students
uh who come to hong kong may not uh major in english at all
""
they would uh they would choose other  subjects to to be their
major subject

 uhm uhm

 uhm

 uhm

 uh uh

do do you know that there  there used to be an organization
called the international outlook which is uh    for

yeah which is sort of uh organization for the foreign students in
 university of hong kong but they also uh encourage uh participation by
the local students uh     so that the local students can
interact with the  foreign students and maybe to exchange uh  stories
or uh uh maybe to uh gain uh cultural experiences from one another  
 
""
but  i think it has already been uh disbanded uh since last
year because uh i think no one wants to  take the post  laughter 
of the exco also     it it sort of exists in a   s 
semi-formal way where some people would just take the initiative to  uh
have a gathering uh but it is no longer under the uh  university of hong
kong

it  ' s

i don't think it  ' s  it is ex

i think it  ' s non existent any uh right now uh

 uhm uhm

 uhm uhm

how  man   meh

how  man 
""
how many members are there in in the organization
 
""
uh it depends on the  depends on the uh number of foreign
students that come to hong kong each year actually    
""
but there used to be uh call exco so     what they
would do is uh  they would cooperate with the office of student affairs
and they gave the list of the overseas students and uh then they would send
letters and  usually they would try to have a first gathering so uh all of
them will be introduced to one another    
""
and uh so the the foreign students will know who are the foreign
students in the campus  so they can uh communicate with one another and uh
but later you will saw that  at the same time they should also welcome the
local students and    
""
uh so so  uh they had some uh student exchange program where uh
they pair up uh a foreign student with a local student uh    
""
uh it it was quite successful to a certain extent uh but  uh
after a while i think uh maybe  four words  so much
 one-word  exco so  nobody was willing to succeed the
the present exco uh  so in the end uh  i think there are no one

no one wants to take over so  it becomes uh non-existent

 uhm uhm

 uh uh

 uh uh

 uhm uhm

how many exco members should there be

uh  there were one chairman uh general secretary  
financial  secretary uh publicity secretary and uh  and there are
some a few representatives from the hall so it  ' s like    
""
from the hall it  ' s like each hall would have a representative
  and  if they  ' re going to organize a function so the 
representative will write something on the board    you  know
informing all the uh foreign students   in  the hall so  that  ' s
how that  ' s how the network works uh

uh that  ' s how the network works

 uh uh

 who   is the representative from this hall

i was

i was the   hall representative  uh with uh 
rijitha  as well

but uh  they had we organize some trips uh like usually the
first uh activity will be  a gathering at the main campus and then we  ' ll
 take a bus up to the peak
""
we  ' ll take   a tram  to the peak victoria peak
""
and then we would uh introduce ourselves and  following that uh
it depends on where you want to go
""
some people who likes the bar scene they would go to lan kwai fong
   
""
then those who are relatively uh  mild or not so not not not
so much for the fast life they will go for a drink somewhere or just for
supper    
""
and they also were quite  uh initiative in  uh organizing
activities like junk trip
""
they rent a junk     a boat then they i think they
sailed to lamma island once then had some barbecue and a christmas party 
  
""
yeah but  i didn't manage to join many of the activities 
 because i  was quite busy with my   studies

so in the end uh  i tried to go  whenev  whenever i can
uh but unfortunately uh i think time was uh was uh a limiting factor for me
  so  yeah

but  i  it was quite a good experience and as i think you
would know that uh  a lot of the foreigners will come to hong kong for a
short while    for  studies  two-words 
three months exchange and     they  ' ll leave uh but i was
quite surprise a lot of  uh foreigners from all over the world

we have foreigners from uh tunisia or  as  somewhere in
africa     then you have uh from uh maybe in the middle
east we have someone from turkey  and uh from japan and  a lot would a
lot come came from uh canada  uh some singaporean malaysian and uh 
some from the scandinavian countries as well like finland   uh

 no

i think he  ' s

i think he  ' s no longer staying in the hall    
but uh  he was  al  he  ' s always watching television on the third
floor so i

i used to go down and buy some drinks and i sometimes talked to
him and he  ' s quite a quite a interesting guy uh quite interesting

 uhm uhm

  laughter

uh i thought uh he  stayed in the old halls before  he stay
in hysan

uhm i  ' m not i  ' m not too sure about that actually 
""

because many old halls guys uhm uh know him well
 
""
oh i see 
""
""
uh my my elder brother is  al  was also a hysanian 
   and he left here for two uh two years     and
he formerly lived  uh in  on the thirteenth floor    
and tron uh was his floormate    yeah

so i i think i  met him for the last two years

 uh uh

 uh uh  
""
 uh uh

 uh uh i see  
""
oh
""
have you been to any uh overseas country before 
""
""
uhm

in fact i haven't been to any overseas country except uh to uh
mainland china

i made a trip to uhm beijing and huangzhou     uh
when i was uhm  in  first year    
""
and uh  and then no i haven't gone to any places

but maybe i will make a trip uh after the final examination in may
   
""
but it all depends because uhm  it  ' s quite difficult for us to
find a job     after graduation    
""
uhm perhaps i may uh settle down in job  searching  
  and then uh go make a short trip because uhm  my mother like to
go to thailand    so  yeah  maybe i  ' ll i go with her uhm
and other friends
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 oh i see  
""
 yeah yeah yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 thailand i see uh uh

is is there any  particular reason why your mother likes
thailand 
""
or are you uh have thai origin 
""
""
no  both laughed 
""
she is uh one hundred percent chinese  both laughed 
""
but maybe uhm she  maybe you can call her a buddhist  
  yeah
""
so uh she  ' d like to go there to visit temples    
and bangkok
""
uh however she doesn't like uh beaches    laughter 
""
""
yeah uh it all depends 
""
uh for the uh for the older generation they like to go to visit
temples uhm everywhere
""
uhm she she always join with her friends to visit temples in china
    somewhere near hong kong and have uh uhm  dinner
there and uh maybe uhm just return to hong kong that night or stay for one
night only
 
""
 oh i see  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 oh i see  
""
uhm uhm
""
 uhm uhm  
""
are are you a buddhist uh 
""
""
no  laughter 
 
""
no 
""
""
i have no religion
 
""
oh i see
""
there  ' s there  ' s a big uh buddha in lantau island   
""
""
i  ' ve been there twice and uh the i think they  ' re it  ' s very
grand
""
i mean the   statue  and uh i must admit the
vegetarian food there is very delicious  both laughed  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm   2
""
have you tried any vegetarian food in the high table dinner
 
""
uh no actually i  ' m i i also like to eat meat    so
 uh  usually i  ' m not so keen to take uh vegetarian food uh unless i
know that the place offers very good vegetarian food then only i  ' m willing
to try    
""
and usually i will ask my friend beforehand uh  whether that
place or the particular restaurant is offers really good vegetarian food 
   so i knew that uh my friend told me that the  vegetarian
food in lantau island was very good so i     i was willing to
try and uh i found it to be really good    
""
uh do do you try uh vegetarian food before 
""
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
yeah but not often
""
i usually accompany my mother to uhm to temples and and try them
   
""
but uhm when i go out and and have dinner i seldom choose to have
vegetarian food    
""
yep
""
maybe  there are so  man  so many choice in hong kong
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
""
so what what sort of food do you like to eat uh
""
do you restrict yourself to chinese food or you like to eat uh
food from other  cultures 
""
""
uhm i like chinese food of course    
""
uhm  i particularly like to have uh  sashimi 
 
""
 uh uh  
""
uh japanese food uh 
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 uh uh   
""
""
uhm  apart from that uhm
 
""
how about western food
""
do you like    s   steaks or hamburgers or
fish and chips 
""
""
 western  
""
uh steaks  not not so much preference on that because uhm 
it  ' s easy to get fat  laugh     
""
uh for uh french fries uhm hamburgers and and many  
others  i think uhm it  ' s i don't know how to say in in english 
 two words  
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh  
""
oh it means uh   one-word  can causes some
""
it  ' s oily and can causes some uh sore throat uhm 
one-word  or something like   that  
""
""
 yeah  
""
when i when i get sick with that uhm  i just wonder how can i
tell a foreign doctor     that i feel i feel that  
 
""
because when you have the big uh booking with uhm  uh the
clinic     the university clinic     uhm the
chinese doctor are  alway  always fully booked     so
uh sometimes in uh if  we are in urgent case     we have
to uh make appointment with the a foreign doctor    
""
so i just wonder how can i tell her or him    
that i feel that
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
uh  well depends if if there is a nurse there then maybe you
can tell the nurse and then the nurse interpret back to the doctor 
""
""
no
 
""
well that might be   a problem  
""
""
 there   there always no  no nurse  
uh  behind
 
""
 oh  
""
uh uh
""
but or you can just tell them what how you feel uh   
 uh 
""
""
 uh uh   i think it  ' s very difficult to  di
 to describe    uh yeah 
 
""
certain  things uh  
""
oh i see
""
do you like to eat uh indian food uh 
""
""
uh  i like uh curry
 
""
you can that means you can eat uh spicy 
""
""
yeah i can eat very spicy food
 
""
oh i see
""
where where do you normally go and eat your  spicy food uh
""
do you have any uh 
""
""
have you go to uhm  to the banana leaf
 
""
oh yeah yeah   yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
that  ' s one of my favourite restaurant actually  both laughed
""
""
because i come from malaysia you see     so uh
 when i  ' m when i  ' m young uh my diet is uhm is composed of uh
""
i don't just eat uh
""
i mean i don't just eat chinese food uh    
because we in malaysia we we we we have three  ma  three major races
""
we have the malay indian and chinese uh    
""
so basically we are living together and uh and maybe we are we we
eat each other  ' s uh food you see    
""
so uh from young i am used to eating all the malay food and
indian food and uh chinese food uh so uh i i really like to eat uh  s 
spicy hot curry uh so so  whenev  whenever in hong kong i i find that
sometimes the food here is not hot enough for me     so i
have to  i have to go to a a   malaysian restaurant or 
indian restaurant
""
uh maybe once every two weeks to to uh satisfy my my yeah my my
need uh 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
  laughter   
""
 indian restaurant  
""
now when you uh walk around in uh causeway bay you can find many
indian restaurants    
""
their name is also indian restaurant
 
""
 yeah yeah  
""
yeah 
""
i i usually go out go out with my friend  baldev  
  
""
uh for she is a indian so he probably needs it needs it more than
me   because that  ' s  his diet uh everyday so  uh  so we
we usually i go to all those places with him     and maybe
with some of my uh uh foreign student friends who who are also curry lovers
and so we we usually go there     and eat
""
yeah
""
there  ' s  one other place we like to go is uh chung king
mansion  uh it  ' s at  tsim sha tsui     
""
have you heard of do you do you know the place there 
""
""
 uh uh  
""
  laughter   
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
no i don't in there
 
""
uh it  ' s sort of like uh little india in hong kong
""
  i mean  uhm most of the people there are indians
or and uh they they have lot of the indians products and uh a lot of indian
restaurants there
""
and upstairs there is uh some hotels and uh and uh some uh 
uh  hotels yeah and some shops uh you know    
""
there there used to be it  ' s it  ' s not really a very   s
""
""
i think it  ' s a quite a notorious place in hong kong because the
crime rate there is quite high     but uh i think recently
they  they did some renovation and uh they improve all the security so the
""
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
it  ' s on the nathan road
 
""
yeah
""
i think they  probably have improved the image of the uh
improved the image of the uh the place uh     uhm 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
i think you can try on uhm thai food    because it  ' s
 also spicy
 
""
 uhm thai food  
""
oh 
""
""
one of my favourite uh thai restaurant uhm was is uh golden
elephant    
""
it  ' s called golden elephant  and it has branches in causeway
  bay  uhm tsim sha tsui and times square    
""
  i think the  food is good
 
""
 oh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 so do you  
""
do you like to drink the thai uh tong yum soup 
""
""
yeah  laughter 
 
""
you don't find it spicy uh 
""
""
because i like  spi  uh spicy food
 
""
oh i see
""
some people find the soup uh a bit too sour   and 
uh they don't really uh like the taste but i i think it  ' s uh very delicious
""
""
and the dessert is quite good as well after  the  
""
""
the thai dessert i mean uh is quite good as well 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
do you like to drink uhm yam coco
 
""
yeah yeah yeah
""
it  ' s  uh i mean uh where the place where i come from the
everywhere is you have all the coconut trees uh     so you
have uh the coco coconuts are are are very common in malaysia   
so  it it  ' s very cheap
""
you can buy it uh uh at a relatively lower price than in 
 hong kong 
""
and i uh i like i like to drink drink it uh the coconut juice a
lot but i usually refrain from drinking coconut juice in hong kong because
feel that it  ' s just too expensive uh  both laughed  
""
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm uhm
""
uhm uhm  
""
yeah but uh maybe you can buy buy it at the at a cheaper rate in
supermarket
 
""
oh i see   a pause 
""
""
uhm you like uhm monkey
 
""
oh this
""
this is given by my friend uh because we went to uh ocean park uh
and and there are some games where you can play and if you win uh they will
give you a  they give you this  uh   soft toy  as a
souvenir yeah
""
so my friend was quite lucky that day
""
he won about five uh    
""
so he gave one to to us uh yeah  
""
""
 as a souvenir  
""
 uh uh  
""
uh uh
""
how about that photo
 
""
that photo   uh  
""
""
 it  ' s   funny
 
""
yeah yeah  laughter  
""
""
i noticed it yesterday
 
""
oh 
""
that  ' s one of my friend has a uh great sense of humor  
  and uh he  ' s good at picking all the very humorous cards  
 
""
so usually he sends those cards and uh you usually  uh find
yourself amused by his uh his cards 
""
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
it  ' s only uhm  one of uh  his card collection
 
""
uh   he  sends he sends a lot of cards to other
friends and uh usually when i look at his uh choices i also will laugh at his
choice 
""
""
  one-word     laughter
""
""
immediately i think uh is taken by by you or your  
friends 
 
""
 oh oh   oh
""
it  ' s not a it  ' s not a photograph uh it  ' s a card 
""
""
it  ' s postcard
 
""
yeah
""
it  ' s a postcard 
""
""
okay uhm
""
in fact why do you choose to study in hong kong
 
""
uhm  actually i never thought that i would come here and study
in the in the first place actually so    
""
if if i would spend about eighteen years of my life in 
malaysia
""
  i was  till form five uh    
""
and then after form five i went to study two years in singapore
for my a levels    
""
then uh uh medicine was my first choice you see   so
 i applied to the medical school there uh  but i knew that  to get
into medical school in singapore is quite difficult   so  uh to
be on the safe side i applied to many places     and hong
kong was one of them
""
and i didn't really  thought that i would i would i would end
up studying here really    
""
so it  ' s like i thought that i  ' ll always get a place in
singapore but uh when i got rejected then it  ' s like i started to consider
other options uh and then uh  hong kong was uh one of the options which i
which i  thac  which i thought was was quite uh was quite good uh 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
did you consider about uhm america england or canada
 
""
yeah i applied to some of the universities there but uh  
""
""
they are very popular for hong kong students
 
""
yeah but the main reason why i i didn't want to go there is
because of the financial  because if you want to study medicine in uh 
in the uk or in     australia is very very expensive uh 
   it  ' s very very expensive uh
""
so uh  and hong kong has a good uh medical uh school here
  and uh  the fees are  rel  relatively cheaper so i
think  i  it  ' s it  ' s better for me
""
if i were to choose to study in uk uh or australia uh 
probably my father cannot afford it uh  laughter  so i i come here
yeah yeah 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
but the composition fee is uh is raising    every
 year
 
""
 uh   yeah but you  ' ll be surprised that  uh
""
you  ' ll be surprised that the fees of uk which which is it can be
really high
""
let  ' s say uh  if i were to study uh five years in hong kong
uh my fees may only be  maybe less about three hundred thousand or or
maybe   two  hundred thousand uh   hong  kong you
see
""
but if i want to go to abroad it may cost me more than one
million hong kong  alone in in in a medical school in uh elsewhere so it  ' s
it  ' s really very expensive uh    
""
and it  ' s beyond my  the means of my family so it  ' s
impossible uh yeah 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
 
""
but when i came here i  i also have uh lot of of problems
because i couldn't really speak cantonese   at  first uh 
""
so when i first came here it  ' s like a lot of noise and uh 
speaker a laughed  i didn't know what was happening and  and to make
matters worse i can't really read chinese you see    
""
so i 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
because you love you look like chinese
 
""
yeah yeah
""
but but the problem is when i go to a restaurant it  ' s that i
don't know what to order and uh  i have to depend a lot on my friends for
the first  first two years uh    
""
then uh right now i am having less less problems with the less
problems with with uh ordering food uh
""
usually i go to a restaurant and uh i roughly know what to order
but sometimes i may have to look at what other people are eating then i can
order  both laughed 
""
so uh 
""
""
 uh uh  
""
you can trial and error
 
""
yeah yeah yeah 
""
it  ' s quite funny sometimes when people realize that i can't read
chinese and     and at the same time i  ' m speaking chinese so
they say uh  they are quite puzzled at at at this fact
""
uh 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
it  ' s  the same case as jackie chan
""
do you know   who he is
""
yeah 
 
""
 oh yeah
""
yeah   
""
""
in fact uh he can't read or write uh english but he can speak
and listen english
 
""
uh 
""
""
because uh he just uh loved to speak and uh listen  
  just for his communication with foreigners
 
""
 uh uh  
""
uh uh
""
i i i just recently watched his movie    
""
uh the first  yeah  the one that  they shoot  in
the chinese new year 
""
""
 uh uh  
""
yeah
 
""
i think it was quite funny 
""
""
because uhm he invest much money and effort   on
 his film
 
""
 uh uh  
""
do you watch this   his  film 
""
""
 no  
""
uhm i don't know why but uh i don't like him much because i think
he  ' s too proud of himself
 
""
yeah but uh 
""
""
maybe because he he is very confident    
yeah but uhm  uh
""
another factor is that i i don't like action film
 
""
 uhm  
""
uh uh
""
so what sort of film do you  really like 
""
""
uhm  what sort
""
it all depends uh for example uhm 
""
if i  i saw uhm the poster or the  advert  advertisment
on tv     of a film and look attractive and i may i may go
and watch it     if i have time
""
and another reason  uh of choosing a film  maybe uhm 
""
as for sense and sensibility     i  ' ve taken a
course uhm novel one when i was in second year    
""
uhm sense and sensibility is one of the novel uhm in study so uhm
when this film  is now on show     and i have interest to
to have a look on it 
""
it  ' s difficult to tell     yeah
""
maybe uh it also depends on uh other other people  ' s comment on
the film
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
did  hav  have you watch the show called pulp fiction 
""
""
i watched it at home
 
""
do do you like it 
""
""
no
 
""
or you
""
uh why do you
""
why don't you like it 
""
""
because uhm  i don't like uhm  the atmosphere to be
too dim    
""
yeah
""
i think uhm the atmosphere in pulp fiction is in is very dim and
 and  not cheerful    
""
and
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 oh  
""
do you find it too violent or    too  vulgar 
""
""
 yeah  
""
i don't like violence and  it involved too much violence in
the film     so i feel uncomfortable     and
in the middle of of the film     i asked my friend to stop it
 laughter 
""
and then asked him to to watch it again when i left
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
oh
""
how about how about uh forrest gump    several
words   
""
""
 oh i like it  
 
""
oh 
""
""
uhm i i don't uhm exactly remember uhm  the story 
  
""
but uhm  i think uh tom hanks is a good actor
 
""
 uh uh  
""
yeah
""
the movie is uh very i think a very  meanin  meaningful
movie    
""
it captures a lot of uh  important events that happened in
america  two-words  
""
uh  it  ' s yeah i think it  ' s it  ' s quite a good movie yeah
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
and there is also a sense of humor in the film
 
""
yeah 
""
""
i like it uhm i like uh things to be cheerful and  and
funny
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
yeah
""
uhm  for example the seven   have you  watched seven
yeah 
 
""
 oh yeah yeah
""
seven yeah  yeah   
""
""
i think it  ' s good     but uhm  from the
start to the end i don't like the the atmostphere   because 
there  ' s almost no light
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
yeah yeah
""
how do you find the violence in in seven uh
""

""
""
too violent also  laughter

to leave early    a laughed   but i never do so
 
""
 oh i see  
""

""
uhm i think uh since my  matriculation     i
never  i never have interest to watch a local film     but
just one or two for every year i think
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm

in the cultural center

""

""
  
$a laughed  
""
i don't like to act in drama but i like to watch drama  
 
""
yeah
""
uhm  but for this year i have i   wat  watched uhm
fewer drama because i have no  s  not so much time and and i think the

""
 oh  
""
 oh  
""
 whe  where do you normally watch a drama
""
in uh in university or in the cultural center 
""
""
uhm my friend uh is also a fans of drama   so 
uhm he get a booklet from the uh repertory uhm  organization in hong kong
    and every in every year uhm we can we can have
reservation first     for the whole year    
""
and we can choose from the booklet and uhm from the short
description of the of the uh title we can we can uh know  approximately
whether we like it or not    
""
if we feel we like it then we have uhm appointment on on the uh
reservation but if we don't we just leave it
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh </[3    
""
 uh uh  
""

""
""
uhm
 
""
there  ' s one coming in hong kong   les miserables

i think it  ' s uh much better than uh phantom of the opera 
""
""
 yes les miserables  
""
have you have you watched cats
 
""
no i have not watched cats uh 
""
""
in my first year cats uh come to hong kong   
""
""
uhm  and i thank i think it  ' s more uh fantastic uhm than the
phantom of the opera     because maybe i expected too much
  for  for the latter
""
uhm i think the first one is more uhm  is more cheerful 
   and the second one i expect uhm it should be very uhm  high
standard     but uh it turned out it doesn't doesn't match my
my expectation    
""
  and  i now expect the les   miserables
""
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 you you  
""
 oh  
""
when when are you going to watch the les miserables 
""
""

""
it should be uh
 
""
 oh  
""
second of april 
""
""
yeah
""
it should be fourteenth of april    
""
because uh we buy student ticket altogether

""
""
uh

""
""

""
uh you haven't noticed about uhm the poster

uhm  in midnight    
""

 oh  
""
 yeah  
""
 uh uh  
""
to queue 
""
""
yeah
""
""
are not confident enough to speak in english
 
""
uhm but for me i think  the
""
basically their english i mean  since uh you  ' ve been studying
english since in your primary and secondary school     as
well as in your university i think i think the vocabulary and the grammar is
there but just like what you say there  ' s not much uh  opportunity to
speak it so uh i think if you if you are given opportunity and uh you try it
won't be a problem for it won't be a problem for many of the hong kong people
   
""
uh a a lot of my friends like  the medical students uh 
their english tend to improve much more after the third year   
 third year fourth year fifth year because uh what we usually do is we
we  ' ll ask the patient  ' s history in cantonese     but when
we have to present the case to the doctor we have to converse in english uh
   
""
so  right now it  ' s like uh english is quite important uh so a
lot of us has to speak english uh everyday uh so in that way it forces you to
speak english and so
""
i think many of my friends  '  english has improved uh over these
uh i think over especially after the third year
""
yeah 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm

 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm

managers uhm are foreigner
