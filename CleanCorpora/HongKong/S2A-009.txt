two hundred and ninety three fourth home was number eleven i
like to smile in a time of one ten and a half 
""
here  ' s the finishing order

clear win to glory hero over classic rizzi who tired and had to with
the work he did 
""
chater jade holding third from i like to smile multi winner finally
getting going at the end 
""
working home into fifth then glasgow kiss french connection and the
rest have been beaten a half dozen lengths to legend of wei hai 
""
handbag  ' s honour long mark 
""
never a factor 
""
and bold'npower who was right up on the speed at one point  has
finished right down the course 
""
""
they have weighed in now in the seconds so those dividends are ripe
to pay
""
we  ' ll check the exotics for you  in a tick 
""
the trio and the quinella place 
""
they are about to filter through 
""
""
be patient ha ha
""
""
it  ' s only a tick of the clock
""
""
yeah the best things are always worth waiting for 
""
he looked a vastly improved horse here tonight darren the minute he
walked into the paddock he just looked an awful lot harder and fitter than he
had first up 
""
just tended to wander a little bit when he had to give chase to
classic rizzi i don't know it may have been the case if classic rizzi had got
far enough in front of him that 
""
he  ' d thought he  ' d done enough already but 
""
when he finally got to within threequarters of a length of uh that
other horse he never really looked like he wasn't going to get there 
""
may just improve a bit more over a bit further yet perhaps 
""
""
yes 
""
""
but definitely an improved performance first up and glory hero
no surprise to see him come good here 
""
classic rizzi obviously those blinkers being put on him in work 
""
woke him up sufficiently enough but uh i  ' d have to say there was a
little bit of temperament there as well wasn't there 
""
the tail was tended to go round 
""
when he came under pressure inside the uh final two hundred 
""
""
he didn't like the stick did he 
""
""
no he did not  but uh he  ' s still run a good race in
managing to finish second i just i just doubt the depth of him some what 
""
""
three hundred and fifteen for that trio dividend of one four
nine in comparison to uh a close to a twenty three hundred dollar tierce 
""
uh the q ps eighty two fifty three fifty and four into nine seventy
five dollars and fifty cents 
""
the first double races one and two 
""
the combination seven into four race one being won by douglas white
on winning touch 
""
this one won by eric saint martin 
""
six hundred and eighty three and a consolation of one hundred and
fifty eight with nine classic rizzi 
""
well here  ' s the start 
""
longmark keep an eye on him from barrier number two he finds
himself off the speed and handbag  ' s honour eases back from barrier three as
well 
""
""
classic rizzi almost did a quick double shift didn't he as he
just came out of the gates as though he couldn't wait to get his feet going
and uh the legs weren't quite as quick as the brain to start off with 
""
but it didn't take him very long to get across to the rails and
leading but uh also the winner travelled 
""
just a keenly enough i should think for eric saint martin through
these early stages 
""
he gets a bit of cover in a minute from uh bold'npower coming
across in front of him 
""
and uh i think this horse still looks to be green and a bit of a
baby our winner of this 
""
and i  ' m sure there  ' d be a fair bit more improvement yet 
""
you can see he  ' s gone quite deep 
""
or had to go quite deep around the circle there for the large
majority 
""
uh were the leader in front classic rizzi has been very much the
greyhound and leaning in and railing well 
""
but uh i thought at this stage there wouldn't be any problem for
eric saint martin to go and pick up the leader quite easily on glory hero 
""
and it  ' s just now when he asks him for his effort you can see he
just tends to hang out and lay out rather 
""
he pulled his stick through gave him one knock just uh down his
left hand shoulder 
""
now he just picks it up to get a bit more serious and uh i think
the horse has done well 
""
it  ' s as though he took a little bit of time to know what was
required and in the closing stages he  ' s got the hang of it 
""
he  ' s not the greatest mover 
""
but he  ' s certainly done the job quite tidily enough here tonight
""
""
well spread out for that race as well 
""
""
yeah the last few 
""
especially longmark actually he was eased out the final stages 
""
twenty three seven early then twenty two and two 
""
twenty four and six the run home 
""
with an overall of one ten and five 
""
 commercial break 
""
""
well of course the first race has already been run here this
evening and we can now review the action of that with our caller david
raphael 
""
""
""
flag is up 
""
and away they go 
""
it  ' s an even start 
""
superior title jumped well from lucky supreme orlando flyer drops
back straight afterwards 
""
but it  ' s holy ranto booting up to hold out lucky supreme and
champion ranger in the middle pushing three deep 
""
projectvision wide of superior title takes the sit behind then

it  ' s holy ranto just in front coming at him quickly now fortune
reaching trying hard he  ' s under pressure though 
""
lucky supreme gets the run champion ranger battles on 
""
next in between them winning touch coming through projectvision
deeper 
""
holy ranto in front two fifty out but winning touch is cutting it
back 
""
holy ranto  ' s got a length break only half a length in fact not a
break for long 
""
winning touch went straight on by 
""
holy ranto fights hard second 
""
champion ranger for third with lucky supreme 
""
winning touch too good wins by a length to holy ranto 
""
two lengths champion ranger third
""
""
eighty dollars a win twenty five dollars a place for winning
touch 
""
number eight holy ranto one hundred and fifty one and uh four
champion ranger fifteen fifty 
""
the quinella paying three thousand and the tierce 
""
thirty thousand and fifteen dollars 
""
thirty thousand and fifteen dollars the tierce on seven eight and
four 
""
""
you need to come with a challenge like winning touch 
""
alex wong yu-on is just starting to get his team into top form now
""
""
really are starting to hit a bit of success 
""
""
solid run by holy ranto he had no stage gave up 
""
he won't be going around at the eighty to one price he was next
time he  ' s in a race like this 
""
big quinella place with him coming in at eight hundred and eighty
five dollars as we saw 
""
""
sectionals twenty eight seven twenty three four they  ' ve
walked home the last eight hundred twenty five two and again twenty five two
 with weight there on the first 
""
""
 don't fancy  lead to win at all 
""
again he  ' s pretty warm in the paddock here tonight 
""
uh he looks pretty fit in himself but uh overall doesn't really
impress me uh i  ' m happy enough to look elsewhere 
""
""
thought there was a period in the previous season when he was
a moral to win a race at one stage lead to win and  that never eventuated
""
""
doesn't look like happening at the moment 
""
""
round the world he  ' d been right on the money uh start after start
when stepped up to the mile last time 
""
he struck his best form beating quick step and scenic star has he
uh has he held it all together to uh repeat the performance 
""
""
he  ' s exactly the same as he was last time for me 
""
uh i was uh just saying how warm he was getting and he was
certainly getting warm on that occasion he  ' s warm again here tonight but he
looks perfectly okay he hasn't lost any condition for that success 
""
so i would suspect another  another good run from him at least
""
""
""
do you think he  ' s not going to have a problem carrying the
weight as well it looks as though he  ' s going to be a genuine weight carrier
""
""
and he carried the one twenty seven last time no reason the few
extra pounds are going to bring him undone 
""
i think the confidence factor might be up a little bit with the
one horse as well 
""
a few times he  ' s been beaten in a tough finish and now he should
be bouncing on a high 
""
the rich man 
""
this went really well last time he  ' s drawn a good barrier 
""
suppose it  ' s a bit of a guess where he  ' s going to be because
some days he runs the gate and other days he struggles to pick up at the go
""
""
""
yeah it is a job to know exactly what to expect from him uhhh
but certainly when ridden forward i would have thought it was the kind of
race he could have uh gone very close in 
""
uh he looks perfectly okay 
""
he uh doesn't look that well in his coat at the moment uh i  ' ve
seem him look better but uh it  ' s certainly not bad enough to be knocking him
""
""
uh i  ' d be happy enough with him 
""
""
he struck that race with no pace last time and this is pretty
similar  to catch the eye coming from off the speed 
""
we  ' ve seen that he can do it up front as well 
""
unity for his race debut going out at a big price four hundred and
sixty nine dollars 
""
he  ' s had the two barrier trials 
""
his latest at the valley over twelve hundred metres where he ran
sixth behind splendid patrol and well beaten at that 
""
""
he  ' s certainly got a bit of size and scope on his side uh
this horse unity 
""
and i haven't been overly impressed with him in his trials or his
track work but uh i  ' m quite taken by him walking in the paddock here tonight
""
""
he looks as though he  ' s done plenty of work for this doesn't look
as if he  ' s going to be in need of it so uh let  ' s see if he can run better
then he had uh or impress me more now than he has run in his trials
