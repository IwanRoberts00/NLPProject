on page one five six you have the change of frances after the death of the first mole and i want you to find a few adjectives that describe the dominant feeling after the death of the mole and also i want you to find the role of anne what kind of role did she play in the development of relationship between frances and tom so on one five seven and one five eight you have a conversation  namely between frances and tom so where is anne and why is she present in this conversation in fact it is it ' s a kind of flirting the the boy flirt with the girl okay so i give a few minute and you give me the answers  so you may have a record if everybody ' s voice so on page one five six you have the death of the first mole and then the immediate change of feelings anyone   so that she is a repeated    indifference  indifference dominant right indifference and she just doesn't care anymore doesn't care indifferent so you have indifference three times right anymore   calm  calm how many times   twice  twice okay two times  frances suddenly became calm and then calm indifference overlying her quiet sadness  so calm indifferent and sad sad is also repeated but with a synonym which word also mean sad grief right so first is feel breathless feel sad and then become calm and then indifferent and then after being indifferent she doesn't care about anything she doesn't care about jimmy anymore and she feel   isolated  isolated right isolation but there is certain kind of pressure in this kind of isolation so you have the word   pride  pride right become proud pride so she takes pride in her isolation and indifference and then  second last paragraph  so something that echo pride   dignity  dignity  so uhm she dress in white muslin and walked with dignity detach this word also echo indifference right detach aloof a l o o f aloof and one important word is forgetful  i don't mind jimmy nearly another woman i don't mind it  and this man only affected her slightly so the pain the irritation the sadness caused by jimmy is gone almost gone and this is the process of frances suddenly became calm in that moment  key word page one five six grow up right in that moment grown up so this well to a certain extent explain the philosophy of lawrence in the story life is made up of crisis a lot of crisis in one night and after each crisis you may experience the period of sadness and in that sadness one dies so on page one five six many of you have underlined  something had died in her  something died maybe love maybe jimmy maybe all the troubles all the pain that is caused by the first love by jimmy okay and this die and afterwards a person is reborn so if you frustrated and then you feel a kind of renewal you become confident again you try again so uhm this is one theme the theme of love frances in one ' s life and after the mole die frances looked at it from a different angle and she start to see thing in new light and the first person she feels that she had ignored so far is  the first not not tom yet   anne  in the middle of that page why did she care so little for anne who was fond of her she asked herself why did she care so little for anyone  so first she looked at anne maybe i should devote my love to my sister my sister is a very good friend for me but so far i devote all my love to by boyfriend jimmy who doesn't really deserve my love so she tried to distract herself divert her attention to anne the immediate person in front of her  okay and then expend this philosophy bell rings   why will she care so little for anyone maybe many people in the surroundings worth my attention and love then this expand to tom one-word okay so he paid uh she paid more attention to tom afterwards  she start to notice the unnoticeable in the past  and one five seven to one five none you can see a new start for frances and tom do you find a new frances  no idea new frances    she is reborn  she is reborn and any new attitude different from the past   she begins to accept tom  yes she begins to accept tom now the acceptance of tom is active or passive  active or passive active because you the word  second paragraph of one five seven the last sentence advance yes very aggressive now uhm the paragraph tom was a medium stature that paragraph you can see that the attraction of frances to tom is haunted  so tom has been fond of frances for a long long time but he hasn't got the confidence to court to flirt with her and top of one five seven frances was aware delicate kind of feeling and there is a kind of clear delicious stimulation he explains so again delicious so the yearning for frances is constant so the next paragraph you can see that frances now know that the best is gone and she ' s going to take the second best  and this is her own decision and once she made up his mind uh her mind she advance rather indifferently  the word advance means an active pursuit active pursuit of second best so this is new advances toward tom the new target maybe anything that suggests you have a new frances    advance    she laugh she always laugh   she always laugh the trouble is over so she always laugh she laugh gaily sometimes  anything else how about her trip to liverpool   so this frances standing tom is not the frances that was in the history    she is still in liverpool  yes so when uhm tom asked her you are back no i ' m still in liverpool this is a new land the old frances die when jimmy married another woman  so here you have the new frances because uhm she ' s been she has reborn after the death of the first mole the death of all the dead feelings okay and also you can frances is flirting f l i r t i n g flirt  is flirting with tom and giving him some hints of intimacy they have undertone of intimacy linked him firm and seems that tom takes the hint tom said this isn't you her heart lifted in approval  and here you can see she is starting to look at the good side of tom okay and find tom is rather attractive  she likes him his faint way his humour his ignorance his slow masculinity  so the first two is okay but ignorance is it a kind of attraction may not be okay and so masculinity you know past this maybe the weak points of tom but now she accept accept it all how about the language of tom do they find faults with his language do they i mean frances and anne yes who find fault with tom ' s language   anne  anne anne said   such language   such language scold him sharply  so tom is a close friend of anne but they are not uhm lovers okay so anne ' s criticism of tom is consistent anne doesn't like his language  such language and she scolded him  how about frances   did not matter to her  it does not matter to her because she   accept it  accept it and she did not care  get indifferent did not care the vulgar speech will make him make her unhappy as a groom  because jimmy was always a gentleman but you to change attitude and frances really do uh does not mind about the manner of speech over the page any flirting between tom and uhm frances  anymore flirting     two words  uhm   uh france did not bother  where   uh   i could if it was necessary right okay so you have flirting when they discuss the mole talking about whether frances will not knock them dead or not so frances said i could i could be very cruel if it was necessary and he was sole to feel her difference  so this also show that you have the new frances but tom is rather slow maybe rather stupid right to see frances is very uhm friendly to him like try to talk with him in some uhm friendly way and when they talk about the mole well in fact they are trying to make a fuss of killing moles and sometime you feel lovers talk nonsense right they talk nonsense and they drag on and on about whether it ' s necessary to kill the mole or not and this is also a kind of flirting and they dragged on  and frances said if it ' s necessary for me for me to kill mole that ' s quite true now in a shaky fashion i know it is it is necessary for me to kill one would you like to kill one she said they do us a lot of damage this is a fact anne mentioned that before moles one-word about the damage i see the next time i come across one they ' re aren't one-word   okay  and to say before him her pride troubled  nah immediately after the death of the first mole frances forget him and become a very proud woman  right so trying to put put up a very dignified posture so that uhm it become attractive but cold towards other men but now tom become rather attractive to her and while she talked with tom she find that he has a good sense of humour  he ' s quite pleasant it ' s quite pleasant to talk with tom and she is attracted fascinated therefore her pride troubled he find uneasy and two words victory his  a few words and baffled fate had written  so here you have the kind of mutual attraction so uhm in the discussion about the mole it is also uh a kind of flirting they tried to tease one another t a s uh t e a s e try to tease one another and anne anne is the odd man out like the third party the odd man out  anne said i don't know what you two been enjoying about i ' m sure  so here anne shows her ignorance of the love talk between lovers this shows that anne is totally inexperienced in romance and anne is too young that ' s why she is totally ignorant and she can't understand the love talk but anne has been a very clear-headed observer from the beginning to the end right so anne said well i think tom certainly is a good deal better to my thinking than jimmy and nicer  so this is a very objective criticism ob objective comment for the reference of frances okay  and well another incidence of flirting is talking nicely the top of one five eight  i should have to have a try he said what to talk nicely frances coloured  coloured blush okay blush  and then why does frances kill the second mole after the persistence hunt okay not by chance so why she has to hunt for more and then killed it and then take it to show tom   to show her two-words  she totally forget one-word  uhm uhm so maybe this time she is going to kill jimmy with with her own hands okay make him dead and then show tom so i ' m determined and also tom said the moles do a lot of damage and frances still want to show him   to show that she can do something two words  yes she could do something for him okay so she agrees with him and she can do something for him and they can do something together they are standing on the same side the side with him so this is a a and also an action of identification  i an i identify myself with you okay now uhm after the death of the first mole you have  something had died in her  okay it seems that frances died with the mole and here after the death of the second mole the last line of the story here ' s in the dead voice there was a thrill of passion in this in this death  so it seems that frances also experienced another kind of death with the death of the second mole and here it is and you know an an invitation of going out together so how do you feel about the ending  is the invitation accepted accepted by frances yes  so what is your opinion   frances has start a new life new life  start a new life so you have a strange little love she put her hand into his arm  is not the boy that take her hand she put her own hand in in his arms just like she advance indifferently very active so do you like the ending  why not change it into uhm yes she replies in a new voice with a thrill of pleasure of this new stance in in stead of saying it ' s a dead voice    a few words  dead is the style of lawrence not really not that sad he can see people dying in his story but not really the style of lawrence it may reflect the kind of philosophy of lawrence but not really his usual style do you like the new frances  some say no okay why do you like the new frances   because a few words  uhm uhm   it ' s hard to do so  it ' s hard to do so but she did it okay it ' s great and some of you shake your head uh why   something she may also two words tom  uhm uhm so you feel that this frances may maybe a heartless frances heartless so she can forget the first love so easily maybe she can forget the second best even more easily do you feel so   yes  yes so that ' s why you have the dead voice the the pleasure of this dead  nah for for frances okay i don't mind because jimmy had already married another man why not i try the second best i have nothing to lose i don't care so what characterise frances ' indifference  even when she advance that she advances towards tom she advances indifferently may be let ' s have some fun together  okay but of course uhm some people said uhm they don't want to get married they want to have love for love sake they enjoy the feeling of falling in love but if a person fall in love too many times maybe that kind of love is not real love so you may have this feeling of frances because dead and death shows that frances is less spontaneous less humoured than before do you feel that   right  okay so maybe frances become reckless become unrelentless in love and as for your argument right you you mean argument about the style of uh d h lawrence now death is not his style but his philosophy is that if you lose spontaneity if you lose natural genuine feelings than you are like the living dead okay you are like the dead person so in this an in this sense all right from this angle you are right this echo his philosophy okay so uhm the ending is a bit gloomy in fact even though you have a new start even though you have activities promised by this invitation of tom okay they are going out they are going to have fun they are going to parties but the loss of feeling is pathetic it ' s sad  and you have one outsider that is anne to stand as a contrast to frances and also to stand as an yardstick  so you know a yardstick to measure something okay so anne is consistent from the beginning to the end because anne is emotionally undisturbed unaffected so from the beginning to the end uhm anne uh the teenage girl is cleared-headed  she is unaffected by emotional matters what concerned this girl is eating and playing and have fun    anne ' s action is very daring forward okay forward so uhm when the mole bite her hand so anne just knocked it down in one blow very forward straight forward decisive and she is able to analyse the situation very calmly so uhm jimmy would like to marry her because jimmy got a degree something like that and uhm tom is a good deal better than jimmy  so also clear-headed analysis  but she has her own limitation she doesn't understand the word of frances and she doesn't understand the love talk  and she stay consistent in the story right her opinion is consistent from beginning to the end and this reflect the inconsistency of frances  her views her feelings towards tom changes drastically after the failure of her first love  and frances is also disturbed hesitated when she is troubled by jimmy at the beginning of the story so sh uh so she is very hesitate when she see the mole okay she doesn't want to kill it but near the end frances become very decisive reckless and sometime if you use the word indifferent it it means that she become unfeeling okay so of course uhm this is a change for the worse it ' s not a change for the better and one other theme that i ' ve mentioned is it the the crisis in growth growing up okay the cycle of death and rebirth if you don't like the word to rebirth you can have renewal  try to look at those four lines and see what is the effect of this words in those four lines uh give yourself say four lines and the next one is think of fire and ice as compared to ice and desire so in the earlier part we ' ve got fire and then ice in our second part we ' ve got ice and desire now think about those two groups of words just write down what you think they are used i mean uh why they are used like that and the last one  the last point is actually a comparison of the two sections uhm in the first part in the first part uhm try to find out how much you react to the words so in the first section you given an example of fire and the second question about ice so you have written a sentence in this last point i would like you to compare what you have written for example someone said uh fire is a flame with yellow and red colour and then we have the uhm what is a youth impetuous fire  so compare those two do you understand now uh i still have some more to say please don't move you ' ve been late for this lesson and you have to stay on for another ten ten minutes
