and uhm at beginning the weather is very good have a good 
sunshined 
but however when they uhm arrived uh at the mid level of the hill
uhm they found that uhm the weather is not so good
and seems uhm will have rained very soon
so uhm john said to mary that oh mary you stayed here and uh had
set up some tents and wait for us
uh we want to go to uhm the upper hill to see whether have another
roads to go uhm or tonight or next morning
 uhm 
 uhm

so uh they suggest they have uhm they sit in a circ circle
and mary sit inside the circle and wait for hi uhm john ' s
spirit back
uhm at the at the midnight they heard some uhm running
sound
like someone is running towards uh towards them
and uhm the sound is uhm gradually increase
uhm they they feel very frightened they they

so uhm all the other members are dead and stayed with marys
 for a night is their spirit
 
 uhm uhm 
 uh god 
 uh

do you know what i mean 
uhm in this story uhm uh we may have a assumption that uh all the
other members don't know they dead already 
they just found oh john is missed so he dead
 do you know what i mean
so they their spirit back to find mary and want to told him hope
told her that
oh john is dead but they don't know uhm who really dead
 oh 
 
 uhm uhm 
 oh 
 oh 
 
oh so they didn't mean any harm to mary or anything like that
