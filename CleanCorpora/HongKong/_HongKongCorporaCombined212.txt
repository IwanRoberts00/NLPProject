and i am sorry we have to start i mean i have to start speaking so early because as you know there is a legco meeting today which starts at two thirty but before that there is another meeting which starts at two fifteen and i would like to take uh questions after i speak so that ' s why i mean i hope with your indulgence you can three words your dessert while you are listening to me and uhm wha what i ' ll try to do in the next uh few fifteen minutes or so is to uh try to answer some of the questions that i ' ve been asked early on over lunch uh my experience as the uh only woman elected uh member of the legco and also as an independent how i see things working out now in the uh new star legco and then uh to give you uh just to leave you with a few of the problems that i see uh which are very important problems and which of course i will go into in depth and it will more depth tomorrow in the legislative council debate which i i because i ' m scheduled to speak tomorrow and i don't want to give everything away today otherwise nobody will listen to me when i stand up to speak tomorrow first of all yes i ' ve been in journalism for fifteen years and in april this year i gave it all up to stand for election and a number of people have said to me that three-words  you be very brave very courageous and i think the reason they said that was and they said it in april not and even and some are still saying it now but it one-word  more in back in april and may the reason i think they said that was many of them and i think including many people in government very senior positions in government they all thought i was going to lose and they thought she ' s so stupid she gave up her job at the review she gave up the chairmanship of the hong kong journalist association gave up everything to stand for election knowing full well she would lose and actually and of course i during the whole campaign i have about a thousand people and the vast majority of them i did not know they came forward to offering their support to me and some of them told me they said we ' ve been told by our uh by other mem uh people in the constituency not to support me and they have very good reason they said don't support emily lau because she would definitely lose and then by supporting the loser you were attacking  us the winners  actually she ' s definitely not going to be one of the two winners so you are very stupid and you are putting your institution your organization into a very tricky position after september fifteen because you would have bet the wrong horse but anyway some of my supporters did not listen to that and in the end they were very happy so i think the reason why i say well why i decided to stand was  most important reason was i thought i could win in fact i was very certain that i would win so why did i think i could win was that first of all i decided to give up everything  and i think any and i think of all the fifty four candidates who stood for direct election nobody has done that some of my colleagues has now given up their profession because they own two or three seats in various councils but i am still the only person who is working full time as a as a legislator and i think th the fact that i was prepared to give up my entire career had a very strong appeal to the voters and that ' s one thing and the second reason was i know that many hong kong people support me and that ' s why i decided to stand they support me because they know what i have said and done in the past and they have communicated their support to me time and time again in writing telephone calls faxes and so on and so i know that generally in hong kong i ' ve got quite a few of some supporters and then of course another reason is that the although the other opponents uh we have uh actually seven people standing six men but four of them are actually incumbent councillors or someone who serve for many years so these are very strong very opponents but they al  many of them or several of them held more than one seat and i was only contesting for one seat and that again went down very well with the election so you can see the psychology of the hong kong people they want someone who is prepared to make some sacrifice for public office they do not want people who want to grab and grab and grab and suddenly when someone like that comes along that has a strong appeal and then of course another factor was that i was very hard working but then of course many other contestants many other  candidates would tell you they also work very hard and indeed driving in sha tin or in new territories east if you ask the other candidates if you ask uh the voters they will all agree that i work very hard and actually we all work very hard most of the candidates and that ' s why the turn out rate in sha tin was fifty percent where as the overall turn out rate for the whole colony is forty percent so i think when voters saw candidates and when they saw it was a very keenly contested race they turn up to vote so with all those factors i stood and i won of course i came out number one i even defeated andrew wong who ' s bein who ' s an incumbent member for six years i ' ve got almost seven thousand votes more than andrew and i thank my constituents for their support and now we are in this new style legco which has for the first time eighteen directly elected members and twenty one from functional constituencies seventeen appointed and three government officials senior government officials and many of you will probably be wondering how is this new legco going to work and uh i think already our colleagues and government officials are getting a taste of you know how things uh will change uh one thing that we have been discussing and we will discuss uh will continue to dis discuss is the setting up of committee systems whether well i actually i was quite shocked last week to learn that you know all these committees in uh legco ad call them ad hoc groups call them panels they have no uh statutory uh basis they have just set up and the one day they are here next day they are gone not even like the urban council or the regional council which is uh included in the standing orders that ordered uh very clear stipulation for the formation of these uh committees so i think now uh most of th my colleagues agreed that we now need to get things formularize so that you know we will have these committees set up formally and then of course that is not contentious but what is contentious is the power of these committees uh some colleagues want to think that these committees should uh concentrate on the scrutinizing fields put forward by the administration and then leaving uh uh whole list of panels uh which they have in the past the omelco panels that means panels including members of the executive and legislative councils dealing with policies but then of course the problem that immediately arises is how can you know we only have fifty odd people how can we join the panel as well as jo joining these committees when they are dealing with very similar things so that ' s one thing i want to argue the other thing of course is even more con contentious is the fact that we do not want exco members or some of us do not want exco members and official executive council members to be a part of us because we want the legislative council to be independent and to be seen to be independent and that ' s going to be very contentious so i will just sort of giving you an intro introduction next time when you see a headline in the paper you know what it ' s all about we are arguing whether executive councillors of course as i said in the meeting last week i said there is a problem that has been built into the structure is that executive councillors are being appointed to the legislative council so they are in their own way legco members as well and i find that very unfortunate i don't think that should be the case but anyway they are here and we cannot exclude them  so one member suggested that okay they are also legco members and these are legco committees but they should not be allowed to be chairman or vice chairman of these committees so as to give the public that these committees are chaired by legco member alone and not legco exco members and this is very contentious and uh some members of course disagree very uh vehemently and they think exco members shouldn't allow to be continued to to chair these committees and this morning uh the reason i was late for this lunch was that there was a meeting of the uhm security panel and today ' s meeting was the first meeting and we had to select the uh convener or the chairman and last term of course rita fang was the chairman and today she was there and then somebody again raised this business of exco member not should not be uh chairman or at least the chairman and deputy chairman should not be both from exco and then in the end we had an election and of course uh we don't need to guess one-word  the result of this  of course rita won and with there were nineteen of us present she got uhm the other person who was uhm whose name was put forward i i suggested doctor c h leung he turned it down i suggested dr conrad lam he turned it down and conrad suggested me and i turned it down and then someone suggested elsie  elsie elsie ellie to  she accepted it so there was an election three-words elsie got six votes and rita got thirteen so rita was elected convener and elsie deputy convener because when the time takes to elect the deputy convener will also have three-words and nobody else contested so uh but so i think this but of course i told as i said to them this morning i said you know now we are reviewing the whole thing so whatever we decide now should be very temporary  but uh i still think that exco member should play no part as chairman or vice chairman but uhm i i have no illusions i thou i think i will lose but uh but anyway that ' s the way i hope things will uh progress and then another thing that also happened this morning which i i think you maybe interested to know is that the meeting this morning was convene very hurriedly why because of the government ' s announcement yesterday or the actually the british and the vietnamese government on the vietnamese boat people problem and then this they and then they wanted to brief us this morning and as i told two words this morning the secretary for security i said since we are always the last to be briefed you were bringing the press or i don't know whatever  goods left right in the center yesterday and i thought so many phone calls from the press and i said to them i said i don't know what in the world is going on how can i comment on something i don't know and they said ah they took pi pity on me and they sent me a press release laughter  and they did it so farcical isn't it so and i said to ellison i said enough is enough i think in the future when government makes big statements announcements you should do what ministers do in the uk you make them in parliament you make them during the legislative council meeting open session in public and then we should be given time immediately after your statement to stand up and ask questions of course after that you can still go on and release the press by all means but then let us be the first not the first we will never be the first as i told ellison i know we will never be the first but please don't let us be the last to know and i am a little of course the the question which immediately arises is the fact that legco meets one one afternoon a week and sometimes the timing maybe a problem but i don't think that should pro uh provide an insurmountable problem but anyway i would like to see next time when the government makes a major announcement do it in legco and give us the chance immediately after the statement is made to ask questions then you can go on and release the press but of course we would have been we would have asked questions already the press would have seen us asking questions then they don't need to come to us then you can the the government official can go on and release  them so that ' s another thing that i would like to see happening and so i i guess what i am trying to tell you is we want to make as i told my colleagues last week in this whole business of looking at the restructuring of the uh system what i want to see the structure that will emerge at the end of the day i think it ' s something that is simple and is very clearly delineated that the public can understand and more importantly that me and my colleagues can understand and can take part in and also the public can take part in in the sense they can come to these sessions and all these committees panels whatever you call them make representations all these should happen in public and then people who can come they can sit in they can y you know come in and listen to the whole deliberations this is what i hope will happen
