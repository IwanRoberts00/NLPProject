<I>
 
the health secretary elizabeth wong is with us to answer the
critics
hello mrs wong 
hello good evening
 
why was no action taken two years ago 
actually uh we have always uh responded to uhm issues and uh
this question of food hygiene has been the subject of stepped up surveillance
over the years 
and i ' d like to respond to this criticism that we have been
treating the restaurant owners unfairly
i think uh uhm in the in this question on this question of public
health it is everybody ' s business to pull together and to be responsible
for uhm our own health as it were 
and in hong kong we have uhm a very good infrastructure whereby
there is very close collaboration and collective collaboration between hong
kong government departments like the health department the department of
uhm uh lands and the anti-pollution
we have uh environmental control
we have uhm various agencies
we have the municipal councils
so it straddles uh you know an issue to tackle the issue at source
it straddles a number of areas where collaboration is very important and
uhm it does involve very prompt action
whenever there is a problem like uh uhm for instance this year we
have been stepping up our vigilance uhm our what we call epidemiological
surveillance ever since may and it is because of the effort that we
have put in that we have controlled the effort at source
we ' ve detected the problem before it really gets worse 
so in the hong kong situation the uhm uh the massive cooperation
 is something which uhm indicates hong kong spirit as it were
 two-words 
 
 but there ' s been all 
mrs wong this is not a a new problem you know
as uh denise uh pointed out it was a problem two years ago and in
fact it ' s been a problem for many many years 
and you ' ve been in your job now for five or six years 
in uh during that time what have you personally done about 
this issue 
 yes 
 four years yes 
 actually uhm the cholera uh two-words
well okay
not not just not just cholera
pollution problem
pollution problem we have been party to the cleaning up of the
hong kong harbour and it does require long term aggressive uh solution
such as uhm clean up the whole harbour through the sewage master plan 
and i think uh it is not a question of tackling the problem from
the health angle 
it is tackling the problem not only from the health angle but
because of the good health re requirement tackling the problem from
the environmental pollution angle and it requires only uhm a dedicated
effort from all parties concerned
now i ' d like to go back to your problem regarding your what you ' ve
said about cholera 
it is uh every year we have cholera
last year we have thirty cases of it because it ' s endemic in this
part of the world
it ' s endemic in india in bangkok in hong kong
we have travellers coming back from uhm places overseas and they
have cholera
but we because of this because hong kong is a city we have very
good clean water and we have very good infrastructural and health
facilities
uhm it is because of this we can control the spread of cholera with
great uh efficiency 
what with due respect i i don't think you ' ve answered denise ' s
question
uh you know this issue of uh restaurants using contaminated water
came up two years ago 
why did you not do anything about it
i have we have uh tried to persuade a number of uhm uhm
relevant authorities to look at the quality of uh water in water tank
and also we have always put up uhm uh notices and uh warnings that
the hong kong harbour is very polluted
and because of that the environmental pollution department has uh
before we embark on any project has undertaken what we call environmental
impact study
and i think we are uhm over-reacting to the situation when we say
because of cholera and therefore everything else has gone wrong
uhm we don't buy that
what we have said and we will continue to say is this that
uhm health issue requires the collaboration from individuals the relevant
authorities
and this time we ar we are tackling the problem at source
from two issues
now first of all live fish and live seafood is kept in uhm water in
tank and there are many ways of purifying water in tank
 uh 
 
 but mrs wong i ' m sorry to interrupt
but isn't it ludicrous to expect restaurants to uh have the onus
on keeping the tanks clean
how are they suppose to learn 
well we have got uh restaurants themselves uh very pro-active
in keeping the fish tanks clean because if you can kee keep the fish
tanks clean in many ways 
many people keep fish at home even 
you can use commercial salt 
you can use uhm uhm many uh other methods like ultraviolet light
 to you know to to purify the water 
the fish itself is alright
the seafood itself is okay
it can be eaten
i ' ve been eating seafood
i ' ve been eating seafood every day but it is the quality of water
that is very much uhm this the the issue here 
and also it is the question of personal hygiene
it ' s a question of food preparation because let ' s i think we are
concentrating too much on seafood here because cholera can be spread through
other means as well 
in our in our public education we ' ve always said prepare food
whether it is seafood or fresh vegetables prepare the food carefully and
cook them thoroughly
 and that is the way to prevent it 
 
 but it is the polluted 
it ' s the polluted water which is the problem
shouldn't shouldn't it be the suppliers who are legislated against
ah we are also uhm uh stopping the suppliers from getting
water at the five uh dirty spots what we call the environmental polluted
spots and they have shown absolute willingness in cooperating with us
 
but the measures are not strong enough are they
people can get round fences 
ah but if there is a question of voluntary restraint uhm then
obviously people won't be stupid enough to fish water in a dirty situation
so i think uh they ' ve shown willing and they ' ve shown
collaborative spirit to cooperate with government and i have absolute
confidence that uh we ' ve got the cob problem under absolute control
 recording-fades uh uhm uh a week ago and the nine people are in uhm
who are still in hospital are in very good condition are in
satisfactory condition 
 you you were saying that people are
concentrating too much on seafood
and yet think i think as you are not taking any action in
nineteen ninety-two the uh number of seafood poisoning cases went up ninefold
from nineteen ninety-two to nineteen ninety-three 
what do you have to say about that
i think uh again seafood has got to be very carefully uhm
prepared and we have always concentrated that uhm on t on the
fact that the water round the uhm the sewage outfall and in the harbour is
polluted
we have no not made no bones about that and we i think in the uhm
longer term we need to be very aggressive uh regarding our plan for uh
getting the harbour clean
i think that is the ultimate solution to that
but of course that requires time
in the meantime we ' ll do what we can to uh arrest the problem
at source
 uh i i think that 
why did the government allow the situation to deteriorate to the uh
uh current time when the harbour in effect has become a cesspool
uh i think uhm well this is something i think is a very valid
question
i think the harbour should have been cleaned up long time ago
and what ' s your answer
ah
it is and in fact early implementation of uh sewage uhm 
master plan because you see you can't look backwards
looking backwards won't help the won't help the problem 
 
what what what what uh
no no no no no no
i think one has to look
no i think one has to look
 one has to look backward to see how the situation came
about 
uh and you have to hold the government accountable
and just saying uh don't look backward i think is no solution at
all 
how did things get to this point
 uhm 
 yeah 
you mean the sewage or 
 the the harbour the typhoon shelters
how did they get to this point
well it ' s a historical uh uhm development you
can tell 
 yes
isn't it neglect on the part of the government
i think the government could have been much more uhm again as
i said aggressive in cleaning up the harbour and getting much more uhm uh
comprehensive and early implementation of the sewage master plan 
 but why is it that the government of which you
have been a part for many years always procrastinate until there ' s a crisis
well i wouldn't use this as a crisis
i mean laugh i i think this is a problem
it is an issue which we tackle
the fact that we tackle the problem doesn't make it necessarily a
crisis
i think we ' re sending the wrong message outside hong kong because
i was in finland at the time when the so-called crisis came up and i heard it
from london airport that there ' s a cholera scare in hong kong but when i
came back it ' s already under very good control
so let us get the problem in proportion and i think let us
also uhm adopt a much more sort of rational attitude towards treating the
problem in this right way
i think the measures so far adopted by the government is both
appropriate to the circumstances and it is very immediate and i think we ' ve
seen the results
 we ' ve seen the results
 
 m mrs wong what ' s your message to the
public who are probably totally confused about whether they should eat
seafood or not
you say you eat it
isn't that being irresponsible to you say eat it 
 i think so 
because i think it is not the seafood which is in danger it is
the environment which keeps the seafood
if the food is properly prepared if the personal hygiene is
uhm uhm followed uh then there should be no risk because it ' s not only
seafood
in the weather such as hong kong hot weather uh and because
cholera is endemic and i think we ' ve got to watch our eating habit and make
sure that all food we eat uhm is uh carefully prepared and uh properly
treated as it were properly cooked but i would say i would
say let us not stop at seafood uhm
but it seafood is not the only thing that we have to watch out
i think it would be a very uh it ' s it ' s a fallacy to concentrate
only on seafood
what i am saying is that irrespective whether it is seafood or not
this time of the year we ' ve got to be very very vigilant over our public
health
and uhm in hong kong we have very good infrastructure
we have got good health facilities
and the who world health organization endorses hong kong
government ' s actions entirely
 are you saying
