 in hong kong 
 uhm 
 uhm i ' m not sure 
have you ever been to hong kong before
 
no this is my first time in hong kong 
uhm so maybe uh we can talk of something about our family 
now
 
so what about you iris
do you have any brothers or sisters 
uh i i ' ve just got one sister and she is very s 
young and she ' s uh eleven years younger than me 
really
eleven years
uh and she goes to church with me together
and i ' ve a bro uh no no i have no brother and i have
father and mother and they ' re
my father is a tailor uh he always make dresses
sometimes sometimes sometimes for me laughs but
not always 
just sometimes
and my mother uhm she is a dress-maker
 
 really 
 aw right 
 especially for you 
 oh yeah 
 wa that ' s nice 
no wonder iris all the dress in lovely dresses 
$a and
$b laugh you know very sexy dresses all laugh 
 laughs yes 
no all laugh not sexy
maybe uhm not old-fashioned
uhm and i remember the dresses i wear in my baptism baptism
and it ' s made by my mother and my father together 
 
 really 
that ' s that ' s very nice 
that ' s very nice and we live in tuen mun and we ' ve been
living there for more than tens year ten years
i think for twelve or thirteen years and it
is very cold there now laughs these days 
 
 uhm 
 tuen mun is in new territory 
yeah i i the north of the new territories
 
i haven't been there 
very cold these days
 
 laughs 
what about you wai sum 
uhm 
uhm i have a small family uh very like that of
iris
i have a mother a father and also an elder sister
uh my sister is uhm studying uh medicine and 
year four at the university of hong kong
 
 uhm 
 really 
really 
yes laughs 
 
oh how come i haven't seen her 
$a and
$b laugh 
uh she has been living in the st john ' s college 
 of uh this university
but now uhm she is at the hospital studying various subjects of
 of of that departments 
uh after uhm we have studied university our relations
becomes better because uh we can't see each other very often 
uh just about uhm once or twice in a month so we miss 
each other quite a lot
 
 oh 
 uhm 
how about you
 
well uh i have two elder brothers and then both of them are in
usa at the moment
there are one studying electrical engineering the other one
electronic engineering
and both of them have graduated and now they ' re doing their
masters and then they ' re working as well so actually i
haven't seen my brothers for three years now 
 oh oh laughs 
three years
 
yeah one-word 
 the two of them
 
yeah because while i was in sri lanka they went to usa and
then uh when they come home i see them but after i came to hong kong
 when they go to sri lanka i ' m in hong kong and when i go to sri 
 lanka they are in usa so 
i haven't seen them for three years so i miss them a lot 
but i always keep in touch with them through email 
 as well as through the phone and by letter
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
but where are your parents
 
uh my parents at sri lanka 
uhm
 
yeah my father is a dentist and my mother does not work so 
i think they must be feeling very lonely because all
three children are away from home and just the both of them
in sri lanka so 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
then why why don't you go to uh america also
 
well uh in america they say that uh because i ' m studying
dentistry they say it takes about six seven eight years
to do dentistry because 
 uhm 
uh
 
seven nine years 
yeah because uh you had to do something called pre-med 
which is something like a-levels i think
so you have to do pre-med before you start doing dentistry
 
so i ' m not wasting seven or eight years for 
a girl all laugh 
 so long 
 uhm uhm 
especially for a girl
 
yeah oh yeah
i ' m not too keen so i just wanted to 
 to go to a place where they have a one-word 
 uhm 
 uhm 
but why do you choose hong kong
 
well in sri lanka we have only one dental school 
 and for a-levels you have to get very good results like four as or
three as or something like that to get you in
and it ' s very competitive and i could not get those results 
 so i applied to hong kong and to some other countries 
hong kong is very close to sri lanka so my
parents especially my mom being very strict she just wanted me to go to a
place where which is close to sri lanka so that whenever i
want i can go home 
so that ' s why i chose hong kong laughs 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 two words 
 uhm uhm 
why do you so strongly attracted to dentistry
 
well from my smaller days i ' ve seen my father as a dentist
 
and i think for a girl more than medicine
that this is my personal view more than medicine i think for a girl dentistry
is something uhm easy to study and two words 
it doesn't take a lot of time 
if you just work during the day then in the
evening you have like you can you know go to a family do something et cetera
but if you become a doctor then if there ' s some 
emergency then even in the night you have to go out 
so that ' s why i just want to be laughs wanted to be a
dentist from my smaller days 
i hope in three years time i ' m graduated all laugh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 laughs i ' m sure you can graduate all-laugh 
 
i hope so 
because i i i see you work very hard
yes
 
i ' m trying to 
$a and
$b laugh but for the past week i haven't even touched a book because
 i thought i just going to take a break for one week during the
chinese new year multiple words 
 uhm uhm uhm
uhm uhm 
sometimes i think rest is good 
it ' s healthy for us
 uhm 
 
yes and i have to like all these days i ' ve been getting up
very late around eleven twelve in the afternoon 
 uhm 
me too all laugh 
everyday
 
but from tomorrow i have to wake up at seven thirty in the
morning because i have classes at eight thirty everyday so 
i hope i can wake up at seven thirty tomorrow laughs 
 uhm 
but do you find the uh subject harsh or hard to handle
 
uh the second year subjects are not very difficult but 
it takes a long time to you know read the books study the
notes as well as uhm
i have a clinicals and i have to deal with patients how to be
patient so
that ' s a lot of stress because you know you
are dealing with another human being so you have to be very careful about
 what you do
you can't make mistakes because it ' s another
person so 
every time you are on alert 
$a laughs 
you have to do you work properly
you can't be lazy
you can't be 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 to concentrate 
you must concentrate otherwise 
 
 concentrate a lot so
because of that every day by five thirty when i finish
classes i ' m so tired 
$a and
$b laugh 
just want to come back and you know have a nap 
you have classes from eight thirty to five thirty every day
every day laughs 
 
and even on saturdays in the morning i have classes so
 three words but hopefully in three years time all
this will be over laughs 
what about your studies 
you do translations two-words 
no no
i ' m studying english and comparative literature
 
what is comparative literature 
 uh about some films and some uhm theo
 theory of uh perhaps about philosophy you can say
 
is it interesting 
uhm comparative literature is my favourite but
 
 laugh 
really 
yes i have great interest
i hope that i can have a postgraduate study in this field
 
really 
yeah laughs 
 
so what is your
what do you want to be in the future 
uhm laughs i hope to be a professor laughs 
 
really 
 laughs 
professor one-word professor
 one-word 
$b laughs 
 
 professor wai sum 
 this is my laughs 
this is my dream
 
really 
$b laughs 
wow 
 really 
 i will work hard
which area do you want to focus
uh perhaps uhm feminism or sexuality
 
really 
that ' s a very nice topic very interesting topic i should
 say 
 right 
yes laughs 
 
why you know why multiple words 
 why do you have so much interest in sexuality
 laughs uh uhm because uhm this year i
have taken a course on feminism and uh this course also have a great focus on
sexuality of woman
uh i find it very interesting and and i ' m 
i i think i hope that i can uh do more research on this
field and try to perhaps i can say save woman laughs of
the world laughs 
i have that dream when i was in year one
 
really 
 laughs 
i i i take comparative literature also but
after a few months i forgot all about that all laugh 
then why do you take english also
 uhm uhm 
uhm because uhm i want to be a teacher too
so uhm
if you can't be a professor
yeah all laugh i can be a teacher of english in
secondary school
so i think uhm double majors is my uhm is the best way for
me to do in the university
just uhm perhaps it can be uhm a means of security
as well because uhm if i can get a good hon uh at my graduation i can uh
have my postgraduate study in comparative literature
but uh uh unfortunately if i can't get a good
hon then i can go to a secondary school and teach english in that way
uhm so i think uhm secure
 i ' m sure you can 
yeah
 
okay so iris what about your studies 
well my ma major is english and my minor is french
and i haven't learned french before and i ' ve started in
the university in year one and it ' s very hard and it takes
me a lot of time to study
 
 really 
so can you just tell us something in french 
uh no all-laugh 
well i don't speak very well french and uhm
 these three years i ' ve spent a lot of time uh on on doing the grammar
and and all all of the sentence structure and and
that
and i ' m doing a project in french detective story now
 
 alright 
 yes 
 
really 
yeah and takes me a lot of time to read something 
read book in french you know
i can't understand what what is that all about
and i just sometimes guess what is it
uh it takes me three hours to reach to read just a few pages 
only
 
wow 
 laughs because it ' s very difficult to read in
another language uh uh other than chinese and english i think
 
yeah
but why did you want to study french 
i don't know why but ever since i was a young girl maybe
i think nine year old i i just have an interest in f french
culture and all the french style uh food or drinks or a lot 
of the clothes 
 
 uh uh 
have you been to france 
no well i had a chance to go to fran france last
year but uhm because i want to stay in hong kong and do other things so i 
i ju just i didn't go but maybe this year but not probably i
won't go this year also
 
why 
i have not enough money all-laugh 
 
but uh you will be graduating this a last year right 
yeah
 
the last year
well after that you know after you get a job i ' m sure you will
be able to go sometime with your special friend all laugh 
so tell us tell us about your special friend 
yes 
$b and
$z laugh 
 later later when i talk about something about
my study first
 
$b and
$z laugh okay 
okay
taking french is very good because uhm in the examination 
you know before the examination you have to study and prepare a lot for other
subjects but you just don't have to prepare for french
 
why is that 
because you can take a dictionary and you can
 
really 
and in the examination hall you just you ' re just uh 
uhm how to say com competing your your speed of reading the
dictionary because uh you can bring dictionary and in the
oral part part you don't have to prepare and in the listening part you don't
have to prepare and just some sentence and grammar and in the hall you
can look at the dictionary
 
 wow wow 
wow i think i should have taken french all laugh
 
 uhm 
yeah me too laughs 
 
that ' s very easy 
yeah
so so uhm 
well in day time in the normal time you have to study a lot
you know to pay a lot of attention and pay a lot of time to study it but
in the examination you don't have to prepare much 
so that ' s the best part of taking french
 
 three words 
 that ' s very good 
yeah so it ' s like how many subjects are you doing french
english 
 uhm i take uhm totally s six courses 
this year and two whole courses in french and other four ha and
other courses on english 
and english you have to prepare but i don't think it is
 not 
 
 oh yeah 
 oh yeah 
 english is easy 
not that harsh as yours 
quite easy
you you just have to study
because i ' m taking linguistics
most of them are linguistics
you just have to memorize them 
it ' s your memory that you have to work 
okay then
tell us about your se special friend all laugh 
we have great interest in it laughs 
i have a lot of special friends
 
no no no 
no
 
the special friend 
 what 
 
 we want to know about the special friend 
so what do you want to know

thr three years

two and a half years
 
 uhm 
that ' s a long time 
really a long time
 
yeah 
 yeah 
 you sure
we have a lot of arguments and quarrels
 
yeah but that ' s the normal case and i think
most relationships you have to otherwise it ' s not
you can't say you know y 
no one can have a perfect relationship so you have to have
some quarrels arguments and 
 yes 
yeah even good friends have quarrels and
arguments
 yeah 
quarrels can enhance understanding
