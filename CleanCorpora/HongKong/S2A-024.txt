""
and so far do you have any difficulties in understanding my
chinglish chinese english  thank you 
""
uhm now i would like to start the tour by telling you some general
informations about hong kong okay
""
uh the population in hong kong is already over  six millions 
and the total land surface area is around one thousand and seventy five
square kilometers  so we have a very high population density in hong kong
""
the population density in hong kong is five thousand five hundred
and ninety  per square kilometers as i know the population density in usa
is around six hundred  per square kilometer  in britain it  ' s twenty
 and in australia it  ' s only three and some of my guests even told me that
among these three one is the rabbit and the other one is kangaroo 
""
and right now is already the winter time in hong kong 
""
we have four distinctive season in hong kong  the spring 
summer autumn and winter  and this week uh  i  is almost the
coldest week  in this winter this year 
""
uh the coldest temperature we  ' ve got in the past is around eight
degree celsius
""
it is the coldest temperature we have recorded  and the hottest
 time in hong kong is of course in the summer time  the temperature may
be rise up to  thirty-four or thirty-five degree celsius in summer time
""
and summer is also  the main season for raining and typhoon 
typhoon in  american is uh hurricane in australia is cyclone okay 
""
uhm most of the typhoon in hong kong comes from the philippine so
uh  many people say that philippine is the trouble-maker for us 
""
such kind of traffic condition is regarded to be very normal 
because now is the rush hour  a long break 
""
the red building to your left hand side is the hong kong
polytechnic university 
""
it was a  hong  it was a post-secondary college  but uh
from nineteen ninety-five onward this hong kong polytechnic has been upgraded
as a university 
""
in the year nineteen ninety-four we have only  three
universities in hong kong  the university of hong kong the chinese
university of hong kong and the new university of science and technology 
but starting from nineteen ninety- five onward three more post-secondary
college have been upgraded to uh university the hong kong polytechnic the
hong kong city polytechnic and also the baptist college so right now we have
totally six universities in hong kong  a long break 
""
in most in all the  university or post-secondary college their
teaching their teaching medium is english  but in the secondary school the
teacher use both english and cantonese as the teaching medium 
""
this large bus to our right hand side is the direct bus service to
china 
""
uh they are all normal hong kong residents and  nowadays many
people many hong kong residents
""
they have another houses another holiday houses  in china so
they like to commuting  from here to china 
""
and if it is not the first trip for you to come to hong kong or 
if you have been staying here for a few days i think most of you have already
noticed that  there are many mercedes benz and bmw in hong kong 
""
and as i know besides germany hong kong is the largest market for
mercedes  and our government impose almost one hundred to one hundred
fifty percent tax  on car
""
that means  the price for the mercedes and bmw is double as the
price in germany  long-break 
""
and if you take a look to your right hand side you will see that
the taxi  in the kowloon peninsula are all in the red colour 
""
in fact there  ' re totally three different taxis in hong kong 
the blue colour taxi  the red colour taxi and the green colour taxi 
""
the blue colour taxi only runs on the lantau island  and the red
colour taxi  are allowed to run all over hong kong the hong kong 
island kowloon peninsula  and even in new territories  but  the
green colour taxi is only allowed  to run in new territories
""
it is not allowed  to enter in the kowloon peninsula or hong
kong island 
""
and if you want to hire a taxi  from hong kong to kowloon or
from kowloon to hong kong to cross the cross harbour tunnel  you need to
pay  twenty more hong kong dollars as the tunnel fee  long-break 
""
and now if you take a look to your left hand side the road 
running underneath this flyover is the nathan road 
""
the nathan road was built in the nineteen century  and it is the
first road to be built on the kowloon peninsula  the whole the total
length for the nathan road is around four kilometers 
""
the price  is cheaper if you go further away from tsim sha tsui
 long-break 
""
and this large pieces of reclaimed land to your left hand side 
is one of the  temporal  projects for our new airport  it is the
west kowloon reclamation project 
""
this reclamation project cost around  twelve million hong kong
dollars and as i know there will be  explore hotels built on this pieces
of land 
""
our new airport will be built on lantau island  the giant buddha
on lantau island  and there will be a six lane highway linking up the new
airport  and there will be a six lanes highway linking up the new airport
 to the down town area and also the train 
""
as i know the journey time from the new airport to the down town
area will take you around thirty minutes  with the assumption that there
is no traffic jam 
""
and the total construction cost for our new airport is around one
hundred and fifty eight million hong kong dollars that is around twenty point
three us dollars 
""
and the new airport  i hope the new airport will be finished at
nineteen ninety-seven  but it is hard to say because even today the
chinese and the british government always have argument  on the
construction cost for the new airport 
""
the existing airport the kai tak international airport  is the
fifth busiest airport in the world and it takes  nineteen million
passengers each year 
""
all the buildings now to your left hand side are the post-war
building and they are mainly for residential purpose 
""
they looks very old and dirty  because after the legislation in
hong kong the residents has no obligation for the maintenance of the building
""
""
uh to live here uh for a house  be  around fifty square 
fif  five hundred square feets it may cost you  ten thousand hong kong
dollar to rent it monthly 
""
and the buildings now to your left hand side belongs to one of the
public housing estate in hong kong 
""
all the public housing estates in hong kong  are managed by the
hong kong government  and over half of the population that is around three
million peoples  are now living in this kind of public housing estate 
so the hong kong government is the largest landlord in the world 
""
and the rent for the public housing estate is always keep very low
""
""
usually we need to pay around eight percent that is around eight
hundred to one thousand hong kong dollars monthly for the rents  and of
course the facilities and the size is  very small
""
i am one of this uh typical hong kong residents living in the
public housing estate 
""
i  ' m living together with my family 
""
my parent my two sisters and my two brothers  including me we
have seven person in my family  and my home is only  two hundred square
feet   sev  for seven persons 
""
two hundred square feet that is around twenty square meter 
""
but uh even the living condition is not very good in the public
housing estate
""
it is not easy to obtain the units from the government 
""
first of all you have be to the hong kong residents  which
require you to live in hong kong for seven years 
""
after you  ' ve got the status of hong kong residents you can apply
for the housing for the housing units  and as i know the waiting time is
at least six years 
""
so add up together you have to live in hong kong for at least
thirteen years before you can get a housing unit  from the government 
a break 
""
and now we have already entered to a private housing estate 
""
all these buildings surrounding us  are the residential building
""
""
this is the mei foo sun chuen 
""
the mei foo sun chuen is the largest private housing estate in hong
kong  and some people even said it is the largest private housing estate
in the world 
""
there are totally ninety-nine residential blocks in the mei foo sun
chuen which accommodate around seventy thousand residents here 
""
and if you want to buy a housing unit in mei foo sun chuen with
around five hundred square feet it may cost you almost  two to two point
five million hong kong dollars 
""
and again to your left hand side  which is the kwai chung
container ports the kwai chung container ports is the world busiest the most
busiest container port in the world 
""
and we are now driving in the area called kwai chung
""
the problem of air pollution in kwai chung is very serious because
kwai chung is a big zone of both residential and industrial buildings so
people living here usually have a higher chance of getting respiratory or
heart diseases but unfortunately i am living in kwai chung here 
""
all those building to your right hand side up on the hills  are
also the public housing estate 
""
it is very easy to distinguish between the public and the private
housing estate  from those  several words  having the
bamboo outside the windows
""
they are the public housing estate 
""
and now if you take a look to your right hand side up on the hill
you will see there is a little building with black and white colour 
""
that is a primary school
""
when i was a kid i was studying in that primary school 
""
besides my commentary on this tour the hong kong ta also prepare
the commentary from the tape so that you can have a chance to listen to the
real english  a break 
""
so we will arrive at our first stop the chuk lam monastery in a few
minutes and i am sure you will see many chinese in the temple so let me teach
you some  cantonese now okay
""
do you know how to say good morning in cantonese 
""
good morning in cantonese is  jou sun   jou
sun  
""
an easier way for you to remember is  the sun of joe jou
sun 
""
 jou sun  is good morning
""
and to say thank you we have two different ways 
""
first when people give you a service  2 words  a
service you say  mh gon  close your mouth first  mh gon
 
""
another way to say thank you is that when  someone give you a
present a gift  you say  dor tsai   dor tsai
