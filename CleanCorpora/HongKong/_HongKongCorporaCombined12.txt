simplicity sim simple way of solving out problem    uh we we do see the problem in china but it doesn't mean that uh if we turn to the other side that will be the solution forever   uhm  no and there must be a hong kong way  a third way of doing things   ha   ha ha ha ha ha ha of seeing things or doing things   uhm  uh you you cannot pretend that you are you are not a hong kong person and and than you can actually easily change to to another other kind   but i just you know if we just ignore this  just uhm and just ignore it because uhm you know again because i realise that in the danish papers hong kong gets so little these little you ' ve seen laughter  and i and i i uh two years ago i made i i wrote a long article about hong kong but and they the paper i wrote for accepted it but a few months later they told me that no actually they couldn't use it because they had their own experts  and that that sort of infuriated me because uhm i never read in danish papers about hong kong so what are these experts doing and writing about it so i think uhm may be okay hong kong is quite interesting for for denmark but its you know it ' s interesting for the world and it ' s a it ' s a unique situation all these things  as therefore i want to uhm you know again as you said before write about hong kong inside and therefore find the people who who can tell me about this  uhm concerning about things i can only see the surface    uh so that ' s and my intention is to to again give a a uhm to like do a portrait of the city but from uh from yeah from a person who has the language and the sensitivity and the knowledge   uh you know all those things since after reading this uhm i knew that it would be you   ha ha ha   ha   yeah   yes i have don't worry   i see   ha ha ha ha   ha ha   uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm a certain perspective   uhm   yeah  i don't know i don't know uh let let ' s not worry about the outcome but just talk i mean i ' ll be glad to talk to you about it since you ' re concern and interested in it    no no yeah yeah  uhm well do you do you think that there is or do you find that there is uhm like an urgency among uhm hong kong chinese writers artists to to make this cultural statement uh before ninety-seven is that more happening now  yeah i think it ' s more happening now i mean uh actually in uhm s since eighty-two or eighty-four between the the the the so-called sino-british uh  negotiation uh the issue of ninety-seven uh is brought to the table of course that uh arouse a lot of anxiety and and and so on but also for the local artists i think it seems that they ' re they ' re more alert to the issue and have feel more of this urgency to  to speak up before ninety-seven  so for example in the field of theatre there there there were plays like uh i ' m a hong kongese things like that i mean you can tell from the title uh i ' m a hong kongese uh hong kong on stage uh trilogy about hong kong that kind of work being done uh by local artists in order to look back at the hong kong history and among the a few words     uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm is that a political theatre  uh political theatre yes uh but also even on a on a on a broadest broadest sense i mean even for uhm tut you know about the hong kong rep i mean it ' s a not a very good theatre group it ' s the government-run hong kong repertory but even for for popular theatre like that they they will eventually feel may be under pressure may be because the audience want to see they want to to do something along the line as well  they i think it a-few-words varieties i mean you on one hand we have street performance like people like alders  ma uh uh alders mok who who who who who do the street performances and so forth or he for example translated uh dario fo ' s tiger and and and and and put it up in in various centres to perform it  but on other hand there are also uhm uh uh scripts about uh hong kong situation uh political or on a more like daily level about life in hong kong  i think that there is this urgency to to suddenly because you see there is something in front of you as if a person is knowing that he ' s going to die uh to exaggerate a little bit like he ' s going to be to to die for cancer or something then you suddenly look back at yourself  and examine what who am i and and what have i done  that kind of things so in general there seem to be this this this concern or this need to reflect upon the the the the whole situation perceive the history the cultural identity    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm uhm but i i understood that ' s uhm after eighty-nine it became more difficult to uhm to publish creative works in  hong kong i mean   ha ha   yeah  for example i i i i used to get my works published with no problem although although is not that easy for example poetry is not that easy to to to to to get published but uh one way or another i mean after some difficulties uh books will be published but after eighty-nine i i had counter that kinds of difficulties because it ' s it ' s not that obvious on the surface uh for example there will be some uh small press or some literary press but eventually may be they will turn to uh publish books for educational purpose or for entertainment or or for other things or small press that close down because of financial problems or  so  people who have money to invest wanted to make uh short-term return  short short-term uhm return of money  uh that they did not want to invest on long-term business   so they want to get their money back as soon as possible  uh in that case they would not like to invest in literature that kinds of things so they would like to publish more practical things the big publishers then they publish books weekly but they will publish like books about dogs flowers  z's-unclear-speech that kind of books of course not poetry uh i have actually i have three ma uh manuscript of uh i have three novels you ' ll see which are in manuscript and still very difficult to get published so it ' s getting more difficult    uhm   yah yah yah   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm   have you  uhm have you given them to publishers and  well actually in one case a publisher promised to publish the the the novel but then he uh he uh the publisher closed down in a way it ' s it ' s it ' s uh inactive now so the the publishing company is is not ac active in publishing new books so uh it stay there for a while and i guess it just will not publish books but it ' s not going to publish any more literature  in other cases i mean there there there there there are not not i i don't find any uh suitable publisher at at the meantime so so i don't see any any any changes unless things will change in the   near future     uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah  cos on on the other hand you you sort of think that uhm in in a time like this people needs writers to express   yeah to uh to describe or  <[4 confirm or console uhm   ha ha   for that timing   yah yeah yeah   uhm uhm uhm   yah yah  i we yeah we actually feel that need to express and  talk about it and i can see from other ways i mean even for example in a in a gathering the uh the memory of the june fourth incident for example the people will tend to think of a song to sing you you want to sing a song in order to express yourself  or you want to to recite some some poem or or something so so in in that case it seems that people need that kind of expression through language artis artistic uh creation but on the other hand in in general i mean the the the the atmosphere seem to be very seem to be more more and more practical that  that people would like to earn big sum of money and then leave hong kong   for the businessmen i mean that is the very common mentality   so  you know hong kong is uhm tut for for so many years there there isn't a a cultural policy in hong kong to support publications   i mean from the government i mean in recent years they have put money on the field of performances i mean the the the the they have support uh theatre dance that kind of performance they have put money into it but they have not really support the the field of literature   so there wasn't any actual support publication uh other kinds of things that in connection with literature  i guess in the in the in the early days the colonial government was more worry about written things i mean you you tend be reflexive as you may write about sensitive issues things like that for performance they tend to turn it into entertainment   that is harmless  if you see if you go to see a play a performance  a broadway that that that will suit them best    there won't be any danger so so they tend to support that that that aspect but but not the the literary thing    yeah   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm   uhm  do you think that ' s still an issue that i mean do do you think that they they don't support because uhm you know people could speak up  well i no i that that is not that obvious now i mean i mean even especially in the new uhm they have published a new cultural policy that that just come out uh come out recently and uh it it says that uh for the government cultural policy they said that in the past they put more emphasis on performing arts in the future may be they will also look at the issue visual art and literature  so so i think basically for the colonial government i mean they right now they take a different attitude now  so so probably that won't be the the main interest but basically in the past they are tut just not concern i mean for a writer in hong kong is that nobody support you you do it on your own  goodwill uh you want to do it nobody will ban your work or censor your work you can do it but you will get no support at all that ' s that ' s the problem it ' s the good thing and the bad thing it ' s better than you are being uh raised by the government and and and and and and the government feed you and you have to to to to obey the government    uhm   uhm   yeah   yeah well  but do you know of any country where this is the the case  like hong kong   yeah a laughs no where where no the opposite  both-laugh  we we ' re talking about utopia both-laugh  utopia both-laugh  yeah we ' re talking about utopia   i mean the danish government put a lot of money a lot of money into culture but and oh well i have been supported by by the government in small grants but uh nothing to live on my god   ha ha   ha ha ha  but in hong kong even though small grant does  doesn't exist ha ha well in in in china for example uhm a writer will get the monthly salary something like that so even if he doesn't write and he will still get a salary but of course we don't envy that i mean you don't  both-laugh  well you may support yourself but than you belong to the party or you belong to the writers ' association and it means that you have to speak from a certain perspective  i i i do not wants to do that i think that it will better be a a freelance writer uh on your own  and you can write whatever you want to i think that is important    yeah   uhm   no how much   you got   yeah   uhm   yeah  uhm  uh   uhm but uhm what about i mean i ' ve i ' ve i have an  impression that hong kong is one of the places in the world that has the highest per capita rate of publications and newspapers and  uh i mean you forever seeing people seeing reading papers in hong kong and  and the the chinese papers do they run literary columns and they uh do they give space to to fiction and poetry   ha ha   ha ha yet that   ha ha ha ha   nah let me tell you that is the interesting thing about hong kong and make that makes hong kong a bit of different from uhm mainland china or taiwan in in mainland china you will actually have uhm good literary journals so so you ' re if you have a novel or short story or a poems or essays you can always submit to some of those good literary journals   and uh they are all around the country i mean so many  provinces and they have so many good literary journals but in hong kong it is always not so i mean we we don't really we don't have a lot of uh literary magazines uh very little uh magazines uh literary journals and so on  so actually starting from the seventies onward when the tut  when the local writers i mean have grown up and be more mature to write about hong kong then at that time in the seventies most of the our contemporaries would get their work publish in newspapers other than in literary journals uh because there are so many newspapers and in the old in the old days one interesting thing about this this liter this uh newspaper is that they have a lot of columns they have s for example on one page they will have like uh twenty to thirty columns so so each each each writer has a certain column that he write every day uhm in in the old days uh those columns were occupied by uh older  wri elder writers that came from china so what they write about will be like reminiscence about lives in china uh in the old days or about uh kind of uh about food or about uh uh uh uh uh the the the the the uhm tut horse-race uh about entertainment about that kind of things but eventually in the seventies that there was the a paper in which the editor is actually uh one that is interested in literature so he think of as a way uhm combining this together with some new uh columns by by by young writers so for example he will set aside a certain space for uh short stories and actually encourage uh new writers or experimental kind of uh work so the the experimental kind of work in seven in the seventies uh does not come in a kind of underground magazine but rather in a very popular kind of uh newspaper  so in the newspaper on one page or in in this column you will have uh very old-fashioned kind of entertainment uh review or so on but on the other hand you will have experimental short stories or poems  coming together so it ' s like hong kong you have everything all mixed in on one page  so uh like like like like like uh just is i think the the situation is very unique because you you don't really say that tut uh literature is pure is noble it cannot be mixed with other things but rather because you have grown up in hong kong then you accept it and co-exist with all kinds of  various kinds of things and     uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm did did you get published there  i publi i got published that way too i mean i i i i i yeah i i i i got my work published in the newspapers a lot of our contemporary uh got publish that way   so so we submit to newspaper they may have literary supplements at times or sometimes it ' s just these columns but sometimes the the editor will open up a certain columns so that everybody will contribute to it and in it there are actually some some actually some of the the most interesting uh novel or short stories were at first published in the form of newspaper    i think it is unique i don't see it happening in taiwan or in mainland china    it ' s only in hong kong so there is certain limitation but on on the other hand may be we ' ll make use of these limitations to do something  ha ha ha    uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah  you you did you work on a regular basis for a paper or  well yes i i i i i i i graduated in uh nineteen seventy and then i work as a teacher and then i quit my job and and work in the newspaper as a translator as a translator and then i work uh as a editor and then i eventually i work as an art director for chi south south china morning post  that was in the late seventies  ha ha i think that is i i i learn those things uh through my working experience not not from my college    uhm uhm   oh really   oh  no no   ha ha ha     yeah   oh good so   so so i work for newspaper and yah i i work as reporter for a while and then i work as uh editor translator i i did all these work so i i i know basically i know almost all the local uh writers people artists and so forth because of that period when i work in  so i i never really consider myself a academic person i i i i have more connection with the world outside    uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm
