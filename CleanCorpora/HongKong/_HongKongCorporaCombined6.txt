so go back to to to talk about your trip on to europe  okay   but you only have one month    yeah  yeah so where ' re you going   i think more than one month  i if you if you go on first of june and then come back on first of july 1-word it will be one month no i mean not exactly one month but a little bit more like a month and ten days or so i try to i try to make more time on it but i i need to join another summer project so i need to come back early  and   uhm that ' s 1-word   uhm   uhm uhm   when when is that i can't say now because i need to compromise with the other classmates and then another three girls from chinese u  they are my uh high schoolmates  so we plan we try to make adjustment but the most  troublesome is the schedule of the exam  uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm  well my advice is uhm that you can book your ticket and uh you can plan to leave on the first of june no matter when the last day of your exam will be because uh even if  the the last day of the exam if not on the thirtieth several words it ' s earlier you still have you still will need some more time to to prepare trip buy things there ' re lot of things that you you you buy  uhm uhm   yeah   uhm  but if we can't schedule it that day i mean the first of june to go because we want a cheaper air ticket  so we choose uh the malaysian airline so that we can got a cheaper uhm  yeah   uhm  don't go with gulf  no it ' s the worst airline in the world  oh  yes i have heard about this but i think we we need to compare about the price it it i think it ' s the most important thing   to do   don't go no   but uhm it ' s really the worst it ' s really i ' m i ' m i ' m serious uhm because i have that experience yes yes i need to change the flight for four times and uhm one stop will be in the middle east and the the time uh duration will be nine hours or more wait for flight  were you the 1-word  cora yeah yeah several-words   when that ' s when that ' s  cora she tried yes she tried with the gulf   and that isn't a problem  it ' s still tolerable to her  the gulf   oh   two words  uhm i can't tolerate because you got the money  $a and $b laugh    honestly but you never know you know it could be worse it could be you know even worse than ever   yeah worst space uhm i ' m talking about the space and uh the airhostess and the that ' s i compare that with de delta and that ' s a lot lot worse than delta    yeah   uhm  uhm uhm    delta is not that good either   delta is not  no no delta is not that good either    right  but how long is your flight to uh europe  sorry   how long is the flight  well i uh it took me thirty hours more    thirty hours   because because i took gulf  that bad    oh  but cora told told me that it should it it took her about i think twenty-eight to twenty-nine something that ' s about thirty not not more than thirty 1-word at least $z laughs   1-word i i took more than  more than forty because just because i took gulf    more ha  whether it ' s twenty-nine one word or either it like uh it ' s pretty short trip isn't it how how long it should be like five six    uh   uhm  many straight uh if the if this if the if this is a direct flight  it take you about twenty hours    okay   fifteen  that long  yeah twenty hours   even to the states it ' s about the same   uh yes but it depends on which coast  if you you go to west coast it ' s it ' s it ' s  nineteen hours eighteen hours yeah but if it ' s the east coast 1-word longer   uhm the 1-word do you need some advice  before you go  where where where to go and uh and uh which  where to stop  yes   uh uh   sure   well my first stop will be uh istanbul   in turkey     so is that   uhm   yeah it ' s sure   istan istanbul  yeah   is that europe  it ' s not europe yeah it ' s in the middle east she ' s taking gulf huh ah you ' re taking gulf no not me   but you mean you stop there and  travel there or   you take   yeah  if you take malaysian airline and then they even they also got a stop in istanbul  so we ' ll it will be our first stop and we will spend about  nine to ten days in turkey yes  uhm uhm   wow  wow  $a laughs nine to ten days in turkey as the uhm   you don't
