well what should i say   explain to me why why we have to record this  yeah actually i ' m the subject of the interview today  so you are not you are only  one-word  yeah you are just no use yeah  come on     oh   i ' m just no use right   okay tell me why why you are the subject  what ' s uh what   yeah so they wanted they try to investigate  whether there are something call hong kong english right speech by the first unidentified speaker   yeah     oh you mean you your own interpretation  of english language   because i ' m  yeah sort of like that  because i ' m i ' m not a native speaker    okay  okay  so they try to see what i how i speak   maybe you have kind of american influence don't you  yeah so much so     so  do you think that your english you learn in hong kong or you learn it in american  i learn it everywhere so i don't think i ' m quite suitable for this recording today yes i ' m very international is it you you have you i have you for one-word for my as my french right    you such international student wow  yes that ' s true  yeah and she ' s chinese   victor is very sociable  yes and victor ' s a very good guy   laughs    you should give me lots of money no okay  yeah so what should you say   so first of all what should we talk about it  what   yeah   yeah uhm back you your air ticket i asked walter uhm     did you uh  oh god tell me  yeah and he said uhm there ' s uhm thai thai  airline yeah he said there is a quiet cheap promotion    thai airlines  yeah the cheapest i found is uh four thousand seven hundred dollars i think  which airline   thai  thai yeah he said it ' s thai but but normally you ' ll only seven thousand or even more in during summer it is a peak season right    yeah  you can't believe it you know they were did i tell you the most expensive fares  so eighteen thousands   oh i know one-word that eighteen thousand because thing the thing is that they uhm  well what they call the uhm  walter told me is uhm published price or published class on it so it ' s the org most original price they offer to the customers and to the travel agency so that there ' s two-words      oh yeah i see   we pay much more than we should  yeah there ' s no with discount and not quite reasonable so so yeah the best thing you can get is from travel agency and i have ask my cousin ' s boyfriend i have just ring one-word  he hasn't relied yes     it ' s not fair   really   okay cool thanks thanks a lot   yeah  so i can't guarantee a low price but i think that would help   yeah i think the lowest is gonna be like four thousand anyway   right   yeah  so why you ' re going alone and well the thing is that if you go uhm as a couple with another one    well i one-word  yeah i know what you one-word   yeah you get cheaper price   well uh my actually my my parents are going and that ' s why i have to take separate ticket because my my parents have the companary  fare  and uhm tut  so they   yeah   yeah   yeah   why are you laughing   my  you disturbing me i ' m sorry     my dad my dad buys one ticket and my mom travel free  with him  so that ' s cool but they don't want because it ' s because to my exam  my exam finish on the fifth of

your own words  yeah   what represents your country  country you mean hong kong as a country or the sar    yeah hong kong  tell me about hong kong  hong kong well hong kong is a place where you can find chinese people and   yeah     well i didn't know that  i thought yeah that ' s i ' m telling you yeah and uhm well primarily chinese people and well people like you and uh  yeah expatriates and uhm    yeah   expat  so you think it ' s international or you think it ' s  it ' s not very international let ' s compare with new york i mean it ' s well it ' s ninety percent hong kong people i mean ninety percent chin     have you   do you think it has changed since ninety seven not really   no several words   several words  you you can see all over there there are chinese     yeah but this is university and it ' s different i mean if you go to uni a university in new york i ' m sure you ' ll find majority of american  yeah but well if you go to lan kwai fong well yeah     a majority of expat right  yeah because there may maybe that ' s the only place they can go  to gather up you know what i mean  maybe you can go to the beach something like that but  or the california fitness club or you can oh or you can well four expatriates play mahjong together if they know that you know how to play mahjong by the way    uh uh  oh i ' ve tried to learn two-words     yeah you should learn what do you call that uhm the spirit feng shui uh the spirit of chinese i mean the yeah the very spiritual  i mean it ' s very it ' s a national thing   it ' s national     really is that like the   like two-words   i i ' ve tried to learn there is a card game in europe the one-word  like   yeah  yes   but it ' s very i i can play it very slowly  two-words go to chinese before and i just  one-word you thought something is one- word    that ' s right   and yeah i thought one-word  for for for people who don't who don't understand chinese they have all the numbers on that instead of chinese there ' re there ' re still chinese characters but you can find the uh chin and the uhm arabic   yeah yeah  so well it ' s pretty interesting though i don't know very much   you can play  no it i can play a little but i am not very interested in it oh     you play with your parents  no uhm or it ' s well you you can find it quite well interesting if you pla play that with your parents i mean well four people father mother brother and sister or brother brother sister sister quite interesting don't you think that  because it ' s sometimes is is very much related to money  it ' s a gambling you know    uhm   of course  hong kong is such a gambling place i can't believe it yeah   yeah tom doc com    unbelievable  yeah it ' s very did you were you there i thought i thought i saw you on tv you were queuing up for the   of course oh   yeah those one of those stupid chinese right  laughs    right that was me  yeah  okay i ' m speaking closer to the mic alright i ' ll cross my leg would that help   yeah you must closer two-words on it  you know that my words and well my my voice will be very very loud as a monster  and and so i ' m get i ' m trying to do this   okay  okay please ignore me as i ' m supposed  to be invisible     one-word   oh don't   you si you are very silly  yeah what you know i ' m trying to read the notice    you see i thought you ' re clever  i ' m very clever but i ' m sometimes naive naive is different from stupid  yeah you know that all speakers laugh  so see we ' re talking about rubbish so it ' s not     but i ' m all speakers laugh   it it ' s one-words influence   yeah i don't know what we should talk about  yeah   just so it ' s okay   it ' s okay it ' s okay   so so tell me  uh again hong kong right   yeah  yeah what well ex     so mahjong  mahjong   chinese people like that   and horse racing you can see the the one-word and and the craziness   oh the obviously i know how to buy i ' m going to have money i ' ll never miss such uh so exciting   yeah sun and saturday   you know how to what what they call the cavalry no sorry  cavalry    cavalry  cavalry  cavalry    cavalry   yeah  cavalry  how how to spell it    cavalry  c a v a l e r   cavalry  cavalry   yeah   l e r   cavalry  cavalry is the is the art of riding right  cavalry is the person who rides    right  no cavalier  cavalier so what is cavalry one- word     i don't know i don't think it exist cavalry i don't know   i didn't say that  you ' re picking on me    yeah  cavalry  cavalry i know it ' s one-word    no not one-word cavalry  cavalry okay oh this is so uninteresting   so tell me  causes your reinterpretation the word cavalry  yeah i saw it on tv and it ' s spoken by a french  there is so it ' s not very quite right    uh   a lot of french people are are jockeys   ca cavaliers  cavalier is more like for medieval kind  of uh   yeah   cavalier yeah   yeah  and there is uh is very spiritual uhm tut a very natural thing     so do you think that hong kong is just about money money   yeah it ' s like mahjong and gambling   no one is not interested in money in hong kong   yeah so everyone is here for money right  well not i can't say everyone it ' s a there ' s a maybe an exception sitting in front of you   you know you have the money but you don't have the choice you parents put you into this worlds in hong kong  yeah but well my parents are quite okay     i ' m i ' m not interested in money but my dad got here because of the job to get more money  no because he wants more money but because it ' s you know sort of how life goes   once yeah   yeah beca   yes he has to do that  yeah but you if you have a choice you don't have to do that if you have a choice   yeah you have a choice and you ' ve got money already so how do you get money you know   no well i don't have a lot of money but i can sustain my life   oh yeah  uhm yeah   but what i ' m saying is hong kong is just interested in money i mean expat only come here because they get better jobs  and the chinese migrate here the   yeah   yeah yeah and somehow hong kong is quite the interesting place in terms of uhm i don't know i i can never think of a reason why the tourists from all over the world come to hong kong there ' s nothing within hong kong hong kong is so very much polluted and  yeah the air you can see in causeway bay  yeah there ' s suffocating    i know  yeah and i and i tell you my brother  and i almost faint   i know  my brother is in a in a french school a french  two-words   yeah  yeah   they do  yes   they do sports in uh happy valley  you know the the race course and uhm    yeah   yeah  you can do sports in the middle of the race course     yeah yeah  you know there ' s a football ground and   tennis court in the middle   the one-word   yeah   the long    yeah on the long   long how  oh my god   so but sometimes they don't go because pol pollution rate is so high  but it it rate  do sports for one hour in happy valley would be  like smoking a packet of ci   it ' s too high   it ' s harmful   yeah  oh my god   can you imagine can you imagine oh i mean uh when i ' m shopping in causeway bay imagine  what i ' m thinking i think it ' s one-word    one-word   yeah   yeah  well i suggest you go shopping in some several words  you know taikoo shing     like london or paris uh sorry   tai london if you can't you can if you can find london in hong kong    just popular as if london  yeah if you can find one in there then go there   yeah  yeah but you know uhm there ' s a place uhm  taikoo shing    they don't one-word  taikoo shing oh right it ' s uh in sai kung is that is that   yeah it ' s  no no no no no uh where was that taikoo is that is that one-word     is that north point  yeah near north point  yeah you just find mtr it

don't yeah well actually maybe the pollution rate is much higher in there  but i ' m sure  yeah you can go to well somewhere tsim sha tsui the uhm ocean terminus  but there ' s very much to do with     yeah   two-words   i think   oh the   uh yeah but that ' s mean you have to be in  indoors  i don't want to shop myself two-words  a shopping mall   yeah  yeah but well shopping     it ' s no fun

like they like saying that people have like nine days of the holiday a year  and they works seventeen hours a day and   two-words   yeah  and there ' s there ' s must be something that they ' ve mentioned about and maybe chinese people have the least frequency of making love in the world    and  yeah yeah yeah yeah i saw that   yeah  and french french have the most   laughs     but  okay  yeah what they call well they call that a survey  one-word     if you say so  i think hong kong people talk about sex a lot more than they do it right  no no you are wrong hong kong people well sex is a big big big big big taboo in hong kong     taboo yeah i ' ve gonna say  that ' s why they that ' s the rate is so low because they ' ve taught and shouldn't  have children   yeah   and they  yeah
