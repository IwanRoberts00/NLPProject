<I>
there was no separate charge for transportation cost is that
right
 
yes 
the price there stated includes transportation right right
 
which one 
this one
the the invoice we look at is for delivery to wherever was you
haven't cite
the price is for inclusive of delivery charges
 
i am not sure
it ' s not stated there
just a delivery note number 
yes but no separate charge expect expect of
transportation a long pause 
 
i ' m not sure whether it has or has not a long pause 
but if you look at page two three nine one the king jar
invoice in its spare place where you see where it said transportation
charges are not included
 
yes 
yes cantonese translation 
now let me do some calculations with you mr ong cantonese
translation 
can you look at page one zero five five zero please
now mr ong this is a breakdown of the cost to king jar uh to to
stutex based on the invoice prices at dealing on mcheaver ' s invoices
lord can that be marked as pe three uh eighty seven
 
yes
which page is it 
one zero five five zero
 
five five zero
yes eighty 
five uh three eighty six
 
yes a long pause 
 
 there is one word 
the first one word 
 
i see a long pause 
now mr ong perhaps you may also have uh before in front of you
pe three eighty nine pe three ninety three pe three ninety one and pe three
ninety two
 
which page is that 
uh they are just the following pages one zero five five one
one zero five five two one zero five five three one zero five five four
 
yes 
uh your honour they have been a arranged in such an
order unidentified speech 
 
uh this is your one-word 
 that this this schedule is based on the invoices
which immediately followed
 
i see 
uh for for ease of reference
 
yes 
mr ong the cost value in uhm the breakdown at page one zero
five five zero can you confirm that they are the cost as invoiced by mcheaver
in in the invoices which you have just been shown
 
yes 
yes
and do you accept that the exchange rate of three dollars sixty
five hong kong dollar with one singaporean dollar was about five to eight in
june nineteen eighty in uh june may june july nineteen eighty seven
 
i don't know 
and there was refer to you you said earlier uh uh confirmed
earlier on that uh there was not too much fluctuation in the uh unit
price invoice price either in nineteen eighty six and september nineteen
eighty seven
 
sales price 
sale
yes
 
sales price 
 yes 
yes
almost the same
they ' re the same throughout du during this period 
and the cost of thirty two dollars eighty five cents hong kong 
to stutex hong kong
 
yes 
and sold at something like forty four dollars after the
discount
 
yes 
still lead to a a good profit margin does it
well over a twenty percent profit
 
yes 
yes a long pause 
and do you accept that eighteen percent profit is quite good
 
eighteen percent 
gross profit yes
 
gross profit 
yes
 
do i accept that 
yes it ' s quite good
this one
 
business want to get as much as profit 
okay
 
perhaps so i cannot tell it ' s good or not 
but certainly you accept that at a cost of s thirty
two dollars eighty five cents to stutex and sold at forty four a a a
profit for of well over eighty percent is made on that
 
the thirty two dollar eighty five cents that had bit upon you five
five zero does not include the trucking from port to port charges
port charges one word charges if any
documentation one word for documentation declaration
unloading so thirty two eighty five cents as appeared in one zero five
five zero does not appear as the true cost itself 
uh what is the true cost then according to you per unit
 
i know that it ' s not true cost 
well what is the true cost then according to your 
 two words 
am i correct 
 
 i didn't 
 i can of course work it out
you don't you want me to
so if if you if you s ask me eighteen percent gross
profit is a group profit i cannot answer that question whether it ' s good or
it ' s not good 
eighty percent is the money equal paying the gross profit 
 work it out a long pause 
 
besides the decimal recording fast-forwards 
referring to certain goods to be supplied yours you were
happy with a an eighteen percent gross profit
 
uh i cannot recall you know refresh my memory of these 
perhaps you can look at page one zero five one 
is that a fax sent by you to uh the first defendant on the
twenty three nineteen eighty seven
 
yes 
yes 
now pro probably you see paragraph a is in s 
paragraph a 
 if the reduced maximum twelve twelve point five percent
discount this will loosely leave us about eighteen percent for hong kong and
singapore
however please adjust discount yourself 
that is what you said right 
 
 yes 
yes 
so you were then happy to reduce for that particular transaction to
reduce uh uh to offer a maximum discount of twelve point five percent 
right
 
yes it was discussed 
yes
that you were happy to leave eighteen percent profit for both hong
kong and singapore right
 
yes but the having 
 and left to the defend to the first
defendant to adjust that whatever
 
yes having seen these you refer to three one three seven
china merchants 
yes
 
these project collaborators had discussed i assume
this is my reply 
yes
sorry you assume this is your reply
are you saying this was you 
 
 the reply to this job three one three seven
china merchant
that i assume this is the reply to this job
but king jar we never discusses
is that the table we were able to discuss this job could have
been payment due thirty days 
 yeah yeah 
yes
 
this will be a special job which eventually led us two
words but other jobs
you only goes through one point
this job was never discussed at all
i don't know of king jar 
as i ' ve said to the best of my recollection stutex of hong kong
never offer an extended term of six-monthly in full payment 
now mr ong for most for virtually most of the sales that
made in hong kong you were happy to leave it to the first defendant to
 decide what price to ask for when that they cerate what discount
to be allowed is that right
because he is the person who looks after the day-to-day management
of the hong kong side of the business cantonese translation 
 
that is right but discuss
mr lau discuss cantonese translation 
 
yeah what ' s that mean a few words 
recording fast-forwards 
so is not in the same fax sent out by you you indicated
you were able to supply six containers every month up until january nineteen
eighty eight
 
yes 
yes
 
but but only with certain reservation
you would i ' m sure you should call it after the argument you
know this agreement it is one way to assure him that business can continue as
usual although it slow down
the usual statistic 
 but 
you in this case assured the first defendant that you would be
able to supply six containers per month
 
uh 
till january the eighth
is that right
 
yes 
yes 
if there was already a source of supply in hong kong which fulfil
the contract you still expect the first defendant to discuss with you about
sourcing
 
yes 
having told him earlier that uh so called i can give you six
containers per month
at least your position as you understood
 
we discussed all major contracts mr lau a long pause
well mr ong perhaps i can ask you to read page one zero five
four nine of the cost on mcheaver invoice price in assessing price
you see well you don't have it 
now uhm this table is is stretched out this way uh total items
that in invoice number four one five six four one five eight four two one
nine are added together 
your honour can you see the first line it says invoice king jar uh
three invoices
 
yes 
that is a may invoice uh so-called uh something over one one
million dollars 
and then under the second ' s column we have the quantity stated
the second third and fourth columns the quantity stated in the
invoices
and then the fifth column the total above of the three invoices
and then you have the selling price as stated in the invoice
and then the next column with an we have the total being the
selling price times the total quantity
then we have the unit cost to mchea uh to stutex hong
kong as worked out at page one zero five five zero
and the last column we worked out the the cost of all the items
sold
and then uhm we missed the uh there is an amount for the five
percent discount
and then we add the twelve percent handling charge as appears in
mcheaver ' s invoices
i suppose that would take care of trucking outlay 
 all the rest administrative ad administration expenses
then we have a total invoice price of one million three hundred
and fifty two dollars and fifty five cents for the three invoices
cost of one million three hundred and forty one but leaving a
profit of three hundred fifty one thousand seven hundred and fourteen dollars
being twenty six percent of the selling price
now uh would you dispute the correctness of this table first
the capital interest
calculator two words 
uh you have one do you
 
 a few words able to comment a few
words without 
uh just just the cost of sale
the cost of the sale uh subtracted from the sale in the actual
invoice selling price 
without adding administration over head expanses
 
yes 
can can you say that this calculation is wrong
 
no no i cannot say it ' s wrong 
 no 
thank you 
i would like you to look at page one zero five four nine pe uh
uh i ' m sorry perhaps i perhaps i won't trouble you with that
uhm i suggest to you that uhm up up up to for the year
nineteen eighty six the gross profit out of sales uh comes up to
something like twelve percent 
uhm
 
total sales of of stutex 
yes that the the gross profit 
 
 in nineteen eighty six 
eighty six
 
gross uh profit 
yes gross profit be being cost uh sale
price uh less cost
 
 one word 
twelve percent
do you accept that
you have it here 
 
i don't know 
no no i just ask you whether you accept that that is about
what the gross profit was made on sales if you don't then perhaps you
 
 a few words any year except no no no 
not exactly 
 you can't 
you can't comment on it
you cannot comment on it
 
 no no no 
thank you
your honour this this breakdown exactly at page one zero four four
nine eight seven 
 
 uh 
ithink i have to to trouble mr ong to unidentified speech
one zero five four nine eight
 
 just like that 
you ' ll you ' ll hear
 
well perhaps something will two-words 
yeah s well uh if that is uh
now mr ong uh page can you look at page one zero five four nine
would you please
this this this is a a a profit analysis work out from the computer
entries stutex
have have you seen it before
 
i cannot recall i can refer to no no no so
 
 you cannot recall 
 so you can't comment on this on this calculation of
twelve percent
 
right 
per sale gross profit
 
i can't recall haven't seen this print out 
no but without having s look at the print note can
you have you any comment to think about the uh the the the gross profit which
stutex have made out of sales
which is a gross profit of twelve percent
 
are you able to comment on these calculations i know you
are unable to comment on 
 
 i ' ve i ' ve i ' ve no comments
stated there it two words stated this i i
accepted it as stated as twelve percent 
can that be marked as pd pd pe pd seven b 
now mr ong do you know how many quick quick frames could be loaded
in one truckload three ton lorry cantonese translation 
 
it depends on the sizes 
say the me medium size seventeen hundred by twelve
nineteen
 
between seven hundred fifty and eight hundred and fifty 
seven hundred and fifty to eight hundred and
fifty
 
 a big lorry 
is that three ton lorry or 
 
 three ton lorry 
about two hundred and forty of them
 
two they are about two hundred to two fifty 
they are about 
 yes 
 yes 
 yes 
 
 but i heard you said seven hundred and fifty right
did i mishear you 
 
well that was for the lorry 
 because that will be for a seven ton lorry
 
seven ton right 
 
 i see yes
on a three lorry about 
two hundred and forty to seven hundred fifty 
 
 within two two hundred ton and fifty 
cantonese translation 
the cost of transporting that quantity would be five hundred
and fifty dollars hong kong in nineteen eighty seven cantonese
translation 
 
i no comment because i do not handle these things 
you do not handle these things
but since nineteen eighty eight had you not been paying to the
driver li ming kwong
l i m i n g k w o n g and tsiu ka kee t s u i k a k e e for the
transportation work they run for stutex hong kong
 
yes 
but but but you you you cannot remember how much was paid or
what ' s the percentages provided
 
i do not run the day-to-day business 
now will you look at page one zero five uh one zero 
page one zero five five eight b recording fast-forwards 
mr ong now this is not an invoice uh issued by stutex but uh by
china overseas to stutex cantonese translation 
can uh can this be m be marked pd three ninety six b
the translation
 
this a few words 
yes and the the origin tran translation will be
dealt with such later
now perhaps they can be marked now as pd three ninety six a
uh that is stage one zero five five eight a
that that is the original chinese
the translation is at page one zero five five eight b
 
yes so one zero five five eight a is three nine six a is it
that section 
uh
 
pd three ninety six i guess 
 yes that ' s right yes 
i think for your honours that is all my opinion and we go to pd
three ninety six b
 
yes 
now this invoice uh is for the transport of a hundred and
thirty numbers of seventeen hundred frame and ten connectors
 
yes 
provide china o from china overseas development
sites to stutex
 
yes cantonese translation 
uhm and then the the cost is five hundred and fifty
five hundred and seventy
the in the price invoice is five hundred and seventy
 
yes 
now do you find this uh uh an overcharge or did did did you
find this uh about about uh uh vague uh charge for for the services
provided
 
i have no comment because i had 
 you have no
 
just just just such a 
you ' re not cantonese translation 
well if that is your position then uh perhaps i trou 
i ' ll just trouble you with looking at two more documents
one zero five five seven and one zero five five eight
now mr ong one zero five five seven is a schedule work out on this
basis that on uh at the first col uh second column you have the
selling price to king jar
and the third column we add the transportation cost
do you remember in the king jar invoice overlaps unclear
cantonese translation 
it says transportation cost not included so we add transportation
cost to arrive at a price which would have been charged if transportation
cost was added
do i suppose if you uh you cannot comment on the transportation
cost you cannot comment on this
 
you ' re correct right 
but if the the cost of transporting two hundred and forty
numbers of frame uh instead of five hundred and fifty if that is so then
would you accept that the price including delivery to cite would be as uh 
as stated in the fourth column
 
is able 
 
well i cannot comment on the charges they depends on the 
pardon
 
condition uh 
very well
your honour one o five five seven can that be marked as pd five
nine three ninety five a
 
yes 
and the one zero five five eight your honour is is
another ana analysis which adds thirty five percent with the based
on mr ong ' s succession which is twenty five percent
and then so we just add twenty five percent on
but i i don't think i i can i can put this in ong ' s since he
he he he cannot comment on transportation cost so i ' ll just leave it at that
and uh i will leave to if you bare with me uh my lord
 
no uhm so you are a few words want to
use one o five five eight a few words 
no since i haven't ask him upon if i it it would
it would mix you your honour ' s record with this
i hope you understand
so i ' ll leave it
i ' ll leave it
 
 you ' re right 
okay a long pause 
now mr ong can you look at page one zero five five nine 
now mr ong this uh can this be marked as pd three ninety seven
your honour
 
yes 
now this schedule is prepared by working on the selling price
to king jar in their invoice and marked it up and and add twen 
twenty five percent
uh on on your evidence that it was sold in less than twenty
five percent of the market price
can you see the figure work out is for nineteen thirty frames
eighty one word without eighty dollars seventeen hundred
seventeen hundred sixty two dollars eighty cents as is shown that
now would you accept mr ong that in there had never been a
sales by stutex at a price as listed in the last column the right hand last
column adhering this schedule
 
i cannot recall the scene such if so i have no idea 
no no
uh if you cannot re 
fair enough though
but you you you can't say that there there has ever been a sale at
such a high price that you know of
 
i cannot say no nor nor can i say yes because i ' m not not sure
to say whether that this is or not 
 
are you familiar with the selling prices you have had
is this that the uh well 
 but in in your schedule which you have produced
has never come up to as uh as higher price as that
do you remember
 
if i i do not know on what basis it was work worked out
you cannot mark up on to to investment on the
you cannot mark up
it can only a profit on transportation
when you mark up you mark up on 
now let let me explain how this is work out mr ong
you said that the that the price sold to king of the good sold to
king jar was twenty five percent less than the market price right
 
they are about yes 
 yes so what would have been the market price
would be the price sold to king jar divided by seventy five percent
that that would that that would be worked it out what you say
would be the market price
 
when we mark up we mark up 
 is as simple as that 
 
but if when you mark up if not now it ' s not twenty five anymore
this is this is simple arithmetics
if you say that it was less than twelve less than five 
twenty five percent less than the market price than it work it wo it
works to the price as stated in the invoice then in order to find what
would have been the market price is a very simple mathematic exercise
you divide by the price of king jar by seventy five percent
you divide it by point seventy five you see
and it and and and the quotient if you multiple by seventy
five percent would come to the price of the king jar
 ver very simple mathematic exercise
that is how these figures at the last column will work out
i just want to show and suggest to you that the price sold to king
jar was nothing like twenty five percent less than market price because 
cantonese translation 
throughout stutex ' s transactions there had never been a
 one word at the price as listed in in last column of
this schedule fax to
 
you have not less 
 a few words uh i think you don't want to
say that because a five percent discount is allowed on the king jar invoice
uhm the figure sixty forty seven forty five want to have been
multiplied by point nine five
 and there was only uh uh other that figure they 
 have been divided by point seventy five 
 
 perhaps the 
 yes 
 yes yes 
i i can i can see the two-words 
 
 yeah 
yes
uhm perhaps we we can revert it at an appropriate stage
now mr ong can i ask you to look at page one zero five six four
uh can that be marked as pd four zero two
 
one o five six four 
yes
 
pd four o two 
yes
 
yes 
any comment on the price mr ong
 
no 
that is a a a confirmation of order uh from china overseas
development mr ong
i just want to ask you what ha ha have you any comment on
the price listed here
 
no 
no comment
one o five four six four a long pause 
may be you can compare the price here s uh uh
stating on stated on this confirmation of order do the schedule of prices you
produced in your affirmation earlier on that is page one zero five six three
 
yes 
the price ordered to china overseas is less than the price
which you produce in schedule price is that right
 
which one 
oh
 
this eighteen nine one unidentified speech 
page one zero five six three is the schedule of prices you
produced in you earlier affirmation you were asked to look at
 
yes 
yes
your honour perhaps this page can now one zero five six three can
now be marked as b since this is a document in in mr ong ' s 
 affirmation 
that ' s d four zero one
 
 a 
 yeah 
yes 
did you agree that the price as uh shown on the confirmation
of order unidentified speech 
uh to the china overseas bu building development
company is less than the schedule of unit prices which you exhibited in your
affirmation to sold an inflable inflated price a official disinflated
price 
 
shows a cheaper price 
yes thank you
 
but now i like another point since this invoice is not permission
of order to produced
payment term was letter of credit and signed
no financial charges
letter of credit is a two words cash
and on signing this order we further secure to the best of my
recollection supplied so 
with with pur purchase mr ong you
know you you never give six months credit is that it
but this lot of goods from chi for supply to china
overseas has to come from singapore is that right
 
 thank you 
well port of it it 
 no matter come from singapore 
is that 
 
 port of loading singapore yes 
yes
 
from malaysia truck truck into singapore or small islands
indonesia inland in singapore you can tried from the jahor bahru from into
singapore day in and day out 
yes
 
so lots to be from singapore not uh port unloading yes ]
well is from outside hong kong where that
 
yes 
coming from outside hong kong a long pause 
 
uh this contract thoroughly discuss that is why our end 
port sales support
 
thai woods
thai woods
these are thai woods 
thai woods to
 
to china overseas building development company limited 
you sold
 
stutex hong kong limited 
is that so
 
yes 
when
 
when 
yes go on
 
well even time i shall refer a long pause 
thai wood sold by mcheaver
thai wood sold by mcheaver
 
thai wood sold by mcheaver or i cannot recall that
no it ' s a kiosk sales benefited stutex hong kong 
so it ' s a contract which you say eventually benefit stutex
hong kong
 
yes 
yes
 
apart from that well is a is is a very good sales 
yes
 
no financial charges
letter of credit and its a few words cash
right
 
no one word 
the contract which brings in three hundred and fifty one
thousand dollars t to the revenue of stutex hong kong is that a uh
 a profitable question itself 
 
which one are you referring to 
look at the king jar contract unidentified sound 
three hundred and fifty as you have seen the analysis
 
we cannot afford the credit
