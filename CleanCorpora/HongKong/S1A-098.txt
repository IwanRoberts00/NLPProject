""
  and i  ' m at home  now
""
""
 oh good  
""
oh cool cool
""
uh i feel so pissed cos uhm i just got the email from my french
professor
""
and he said that i  ha  have i i  s  talked to him
and i want to do like the revolution french revolution
""
and he said that okay you do french revolution but you have to do
  uh 
""
""
 that   thing you have to do for a course or
""
""
for my course that  ' s uh i took one course this semester and
that  ' s like french essay writing
""
you have to write like two thousand words and plus twenty minutes
  presentation 
""
""
 and   then you have to choose a topic for it yeah
""
""
yeah and then and then like and then like i thought that my
topic is okay and then like he said that oh you have to do like french
revolution related to uh  f  how do you construct to french identity
""
you know i was   like oh my  god
""
are you kidding i couldn't even do it in english man
""
""
  well that  ' s pretty hard  
""
no but  laughter  your french is better than  mine
""
well   i know nothing about french 
""
""
 no   no no if i  ' m if i  ' m so i feel so i feel
actually i feel so regretted that i  ' d i i decided to do a french major
because all you do like i you take uh like all those three credits french
course but actually like the workload is about like a twelve like like a
twelve-credit course
""
the workload is like that
""
and they split it up because they want you to kind like get the
most
""
but then i feel like i cos my french is so shit
""
i feel
""
""
no no no  laughter 
""
""
it  ' s good  laughter 
""
""
no
""
""
yes
""
""
no that  ' s not true anyway
""
""
but   at least  you can speak french fluently
""
""
 does it not  
""
no
""
""
yes you are
""
""
no i can't speak french i can't say i speak french fluently
seriously
""
""
well but at least you can have some simple conversation where
""
""
yeah but uh but uhm  tut  but like the courses that i
took is something like uhm like doing french literature and i like writing
and really big essay in the  re    really serious topics uh 
""
""
 i just thought that   you you could benefit from
learning that
""
""
i don't know if it is like because like in last semester i
ticked uh french literature course and then and then and then like i do it so
hard like i don't even understand what that mean
""
""
  but then  because of you it  ' s like trapped in
between getting good grades or good courses
""
""
 and  
""
i don't know i don't even   realise 
""
""
 realise   what
""
""
i don't know even if that that courses like good for me
because it  ' s too hard like too advanced for me
""
i  i oh i like i i look up all those words in a dictionary you
know like but still i don't even get like seventy percent of what  ' s that
mean because that was like very like in sixteenth century
""
""
you  ' ll have to   discuss this  with your professor
""
""
 so how hard  
""
yeah and then he said in like two hours
""
actually i loved the professor a lot
""
because i feel sorry i  s  but then like i feel sorry though
because i might it  ' s it  ' s the problem like my standard is so bad
""
it  ' s not   his problem 
""
""
 i guess   it  ' s not only your problem that
""
""
yeah   yeah 
""
""
 don't   don't worry about that
""
""
but  laughter  i   don't know 
""
""
 if   everyone thinks thinks that the course is
hard that it should be okay
""
""
  uh  yeah but i thought but uh yeah may be a bit
but i french  y  you know like my  o  my spoken french is
better and like my written french like my grammar is weak so when i write it  ' s
  so bad 
""
""
 i think that  ' s not your own problem  
""
 but i think   written french hard
""
grammar is hard for   every language 
""
""
 uh  
""
  whatever 
""
""
 if you   work hard i know you can do it
""
""
uh you  ' re right i   feel  s  
""
""
 i  ' m   serious
""
""
uhm  laughter    thanks indeed 
""
""
 i have the   confidence i know you can do it
