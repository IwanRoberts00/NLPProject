<I>
jeff just told me that we missed someone from marketing uh
 several-words here anita ma
in fact she is part of our p and g uh life right now
she is working part time in p and g so you can ask her after the
whole presentation 
ok for brand or sometimes we call it marketing 
what is our mission 
our mission is to build growing profitable and sustainable brand
franchise 
what does it mean 
it means doing everything required to build healthy profitable and
long-term brand business 
doing it better than competitors and contribute to a long-term
business goal for the total company 
to achieve this mission we must have the people so our second
mission to develop leadership skill of our people so they can become
outstanding brand manager and who can make important contribution to the
business and take on increasing responsibility and one day become general
manager 
there are a lot of things that we are doing 
uh first thing is brand concept
we will develop brand concept like two-in-one shampoo and position
our brand in the marketplace for maximum long-term advantage 
once we have the brand concept we ' ll work with the advertising
agency and develop excellent tv copy and then we put impactful media
weight behind it 
furthermore we ' ll have world class packaging for our p and g
quality product 
and finally we ' ll propose pricing promotion and
merchandizing plans to achieve our consumer trial and loyalty objective or
trade support and display 
ok let me tell you some of the things that we really done 
i will like to show you two tv copies and then you tell me which
one you like or you enjoy looking at okay speaker-shows-tv-adverts
johnson and johnson please raise your hand
okay
rejoice for kids 
uh it is surprising 
well but maybe you are adults 
you are not kids anymore
uh doesn't matter
there is no true or wrong answer
the reason i ' m going to i just show you these two copies that the
rejoice for kids commercial is part of our main duty
as the brand or marketing people we have to develop excellent tv
copy to communicate our brand ' s benefit or positioning 
let me ask you one more question
what is the benefit that we promise in the rejoice kids tv copy
no
well maybe i will answer 
the answer is in one step kids ' hair is soft without tears 
let me show you one more tv copy maybe you will be more interested
in looking at uh especially for the ladies 
this is a copy in a very different category
cosmetic speaker-shows-tv-adverts 
twenty-four hours whiten your skin 
okay that ' s all the tv copy that i have to show you
if you want to look at more tv copy either you join p and g or you
go home and watch television 
okay next is about the career path in marketing 
once you join p and g you ' ll be a brand assistant in the
marketing department
as a brand assistant uh the title may not be that good but it
is equivalent to assistant product manager in the other companies 
as a brand assistant you ' ll be responsible for proposing and
executing promotion independently and furthermore managing a huge
marketing budget on your own
of course there will be training 
there will be training about corporation p and g way of doing
things like memo writing and ch communication and furthermore
there will be functional training on marketing like looking at tv copy
storyboard or media training
in addition which i think is the most important part of it is
training and coaching from the brand manager because we as brand
managers we are responsible to make sure you will succeed in p and g 
with strong performance you will be promoted to advertising manager
and may even be eventually promoted to general manager of a country 
that ' s all about brand or advertising 
next i will pass to jeff tang to talk about sales 
thank you jeff 
well before i start my presentations can anybody make a try to
make a guess what on earth is finance 
now uh our department is called finance and accounting so in short
these folks normally calls us f and a 
but can anybody try attempt to make a guess what on earth fi
 finance do 
any guess
no
we count money every single day iron money notes go out to the
stock market and trade gamble 
steven
yes managing credit definitely 
sure you are from sales so you know 
well okay
now just imagine you uhm you find uh you want to have uh your own
company and also imagine that you ' ve ha already had a good product
you have good guys like howard 
he has drawn up an excellent advertising campaign for you to sell
this product and you also have help from excellent people such as jeff and
his team to help the merchandise it how to distribute it 
now the next question is how much am i going to sell this product
for 
how much money will i make 
when can i expand 
how much money do i need in in the first place to start up this
business etcetera 
now all of these questions are finance come into play 
we answer all these questions and a whole lot more
uh the finance department or the f and a department depends on how
they want to call us uhm we are the department that helps to form uh think of
plan how to sell a product uhm profitably and we also participate in
drawing up plans and strategies of of the company with the help uh from
our dear colleagues from the other departments 
now all these i can summarize it into our mission statements
finance is the only department that has to consistently uh be
involved and make sure that the company ' s return on assets is maximized
maximize the bene the benefits and the returns to our
shareholders 
now the uh finance and accounting department is split into two
sections 
uh one section is called well as the name tells it it ' s accounting
accounting is well what do accounting do 
do you know what accounting is
well accou uh accounting sections they keep tab of our
financial statements internal control treasuries and of course safeguard of
the company ' s assets 
another sections then is the uh financial analysis sections
if you join us then you will start at the financial analysis
sections
so the next question you probably that you ask is so what will i do
if i join the f and a department 
well there ' s a quite a lot of projects that we often involved but
uh i can summarize it into five main areas 
and the first area is goal setting for the company and target
setting
uh this is where uh we set up profit and volume targets for the
company for the coming years with input from the other departments 
the purpose of this exercise is planning
well why do i need planning 
well michael 1-word will tell you why you need
planning but uh one of the main reason is we want to make sure that the
whole or every department in the company is keeping the focus on the same
projects that will ensure we continually de deliver profits to the
company and finance is the only department that ' s heavily involved in uh
long-term planning and strategic planning of where we want to go how much
are we going to make what are we going to sell how much are we going to
sell 
the next area is profit forecast and control 
now after you have set your target then what ' s the next thing
then you have to deliver it otherwise there ' s no sense of
 set setting a target
uhm in order to do this whoever is the forecaster as we normally
call it has to have excellent knowledge of what ' s going on in the business
that means both inside and outside of the company 
what ' s happenin what ' s the companies doing
what are our strategies
what are our plans
what are our strengths and weaknesses
and what ' s happening outside in the business environment
how are our competitors reacting
how do the consumers react to whatever plan that we have drawn up
to 
the third one is cost control
this is especially crucial for an operation such as hong kong 
now when i talk cost control i mean two things
first of all of course it ' s my product 
now for hong kong why is that it ' s important because hong kong
import hundred percent of all the products that we sell starting from
pampers whisper our shampoos all the way to cosmetics
now in here we have to work very closely with our suppliers most
of them are foreign suppliers
make sure we under the understand the cost structures and
make sure that we can have we can lower our costs and at the same time have
good quality products 
now this is first aspect of cost control
the second aspect is to how do i cost control our own operating
cost such as uhm my working sis uhm our work system
in here then representatives from our department will have to work
closely with other departments uhm to maximize our efficiency and to
lower our uh operating costs 
the fourth area is investment in analysis
i ' m sure all of you will be very familiar with this
this basically means feasibility study 
for example i have an excellent product here 
shall i launch it 
shall i not launch it 
now if i decided to launch it how am i going to launch it
at what price am i going sell
what is the reasonable price level
what is the reasonable profit level
this is where we come uh come into play 
and the last aspect is competitive analysis
uhm i ' ve talked about this briefly uh a while ago
that means i need to understand what my competitors doing and a
broad view
what are the strengths and weaknesses 
what are the strategic emphasis right now
for example are they into detergents
are they into shampoo or what are the categories that they are
into right now 
now so this is very broad view of the tasks that we uh the
finance department mainly concentrate on 
uhm when you join us as i said you will join the financial
analysis section and start as an financial analyst 
uhm here you gain the technical expertise of finance and as
you progress you will ho have a more challenging task and you become
the f and a manager or the finance and accounting manager
that means this person will be in charge of the whole financing
and accounting department of the o of a country such as for example
hong kong
now here as raymond said the timing is not fixed
it all depends on your performance and but you can be
rest assured that uhm experienced finance managers will be available all the
times to make sure that you maximize your development 
now how far you go how fast you go is only depend on you 
the results that you deliver the contributions you contribute to
the company and your own performance 
now with this i would like to pass on to raymond again to cri
 uh to briefly discuss the other departments that we have in p and g 
i ' m let me introduce myself first
i ' m eric chiang the sales manager of autodesk far east limited
uh autodesk the company who developed autocad uh you know
autocad several-words 
and uh this today we have uh we have the honor to have two
gentlemen to speak up for today ' s uh seminars

and also erocks also from future solutions laboratory limited

from architectural engineering and construction business in hong kong and
they carry a lot of uh hardware software products
and part of the the the the the software they want to to talk
about today is two things 
one is the hyper cad technology

 ano another another uh uh uh technology is the uh ras
techni raster technology
he will talk about uh how to uh uh use this hypercad technology to
to help you finish some of the uh uh jobs that we need to do 
and another technology he would he would like to talk about is the
drawing management software

hong kong because when we have more and more paper drawings as well as
electronic file formats you need some way to manage your files
