good afternoon madam speaker honorable adjudicators 
member of this house ladies and gentlemen 
in the long term we our side foresee some developments which
will incur an necessity of having the twenty-four hour bord border
crossing with shenzhen
first of all at present we have an on average about two
hundred and thousand people pass the check point
however after five years the number of commuters will
increase to about three hundred thousands to four hundred thousand people 
we say there is a genuine need to operate the border crossing for
twenty-four hours to smooth the human traffic and transition 
second of all now it is determined that china will enter into
the wto 
with china ' s accession to wto and the globalization of
other countries across the world we foresee that the number of trade
opportunities in hong kong will definitely be increased so we say 
it will do good to hong kong by having the twenty-four hour border crossing
to smooth the transition and strengthen the economic tie between pearl
river delta shenzhen and hong kong 
before open before opening up our case i would like to deal with the
rebuttals one by one 
first of all the other side said that hong kong the
relocations of hong kong businessmen to china will weaken the
competitiveness of hong kong
however they say the relocation is a competition against hong
kong but we say the relocation is a cooperation with hong kong
why do i say so because as we all know that china has
the advantage of cheap labor cost and cheap land cost
however hong kong also has its own advantage that is
its technological advancement
while hong kong businessmen may make use of uh the cheap labor and
cheap uh land in china hong kong businessmen still have to depend on the
technological advancement in hong kong 
so actually by smoothing uh the transition uh between the two
places their economic tie will be strengthened by having them to
cooperate with each other on their mutual benefits 
and second rebuttal is that they say uhm that th 
this uh policy is just for a minority of busines businessmen but
however we say if the economic tie bid with china is strengthen
 then the whole hong kong economy will be strengthened and then 
with the strengthened hong kong economy the whole population of hong kong
people will be benef will be benefited from that
and third uh arguments of rebuttal is that they say the
twenty-four hour policy is a kind of uh wasting manpower but we say
this is not because uhm we can d uh depend on the technological
devices like using uh the smartcard uh uh to uh pass through the uh check
point
with with these electronic devices we say uhm this is uh we
don't need a lot of manpower so this is not a waste of manpower 
and after dealing with the rebuttal i would like to tell you
what the actual government policy is doing now 
now the governments confine the twenty-four hour border crossing at
lok ma chau and so we have to do with lok ma chau
and uhm building up uh having the check point at lok ma chau
will do good to hong kong
why do i say so because there will be a railway running between
hong kong and china at lok ma chau in year two thousand and four so with
a twe uh with a twenty-four hour uh bord border crossing
check point at lok ma chau this is this would definitely do good to hong
kong because this would strengthen the tie and communication by
having a railway there 
and so we say this government policy is beneficial to three main
arguments 
first argument is about the philosophical argument about one
country and two system and second argument is about the economic concern
 about economic cooperation and tourism and third argument is about
the feasibility 
and now and i as a captain will deal with the philosophical point
under the one country two system we hong kong as is
supposed to have a strong tie with hong uh china both economically
and socially
and we say by implementing this twenty-four hour policy will
increase this tie
and this spirit of tie uh with china is actually echoing uh
with the basic law
i quote from the basic law from article one 
 the hong kong special administrative region is an
inalienable part of the people ' s republic of china 
so this is the philosophical basis that we want to put forward
today and the second point would be dealt the second point of
economic poin uh poin uh arguments and feasibility argument
will be dealt with my s first speaker christine and uh my
second speaker will deal with the rebuttals and so on
and so for all these reason i ' m proud to open the case
thank you 
ladies and gentlemen a very good afternoon
uhm firstly i think one of the main fallacies that the negative
side has been making is that i like to remind you even in china there is
a system of not not free flow within china ' s 1-syllable 
china ' s provinces and therefore uhm i think their point on that there is
free flow in china does not does not stand and further they had mentioned
that there is a demand for the twenty-four hour border crossing
a demand does not equal to a need
although there may be people voicing their opinions that they want
a twenty-four hour border crossing but this is not insufficient to establish
the necessity for this twenty-four hour bording cro border crossing
and uhm a simple example if you gave us statistics of how many
people are increasing to uhm cross the border
all these are is the same amount of people going to be crossing 
at uh let say five a m in the morning 
this is absurd
and secondly uhm they have mentioned about the economic cost
as my captain has already mentioned there are economic cost
problems such as the infrastructure human resources and the cost
effectiveness and uhm they mention that there is not there is not a need
for people to watch over the uhm to watch over uhm there is not a need to
increase the labor if there ' s a twenty-four hour border crossing
for the very simple ex very simple example uhm we need
people to watch to check over illegal immigrants and is this not an
increase in labor and this not an increase in economic cost
because of today ' s motion is that the twenty-four hour border
crossing would do more harm than good
and one of the most obvious and concrete problems that we will face
is economic harms to hong kong as a whole
there ' re three main economic problems i ' ll put forward to you
today
firstly property prices secondly the intellectual
property factors and finally the impact on the local retail business 
uhm these are three crucial factors that will affect hong kong ' s
 econom economy as a whole 
uh let me let me make one thing clear first
what this twenty-four hour border crossing does is it it brings
in encouragement of the mobility between hong kong and china
it is telling you that it ' s going to be more convenient for
you to go to and fro hong kong and china
and what does this do
problem one the property prices
they they mention themselves that land is cheap in china but
then they said that because there is uhm techonolo technological
advancements in hong kong and this will still attract people to stay in
hong kong
i believe if the land prices is cheap in china then you will go
buy houses there and technological advancements in hong kong will not be
tempting enough for it to keep you here
and furthermore there are technological advancements in china as
well 
so finally what will happen is that people will purchase houses
in china and what this does to hong kong is it decreases in
retail prices in hong kong
let me remind you one of the main resource of income of hong kong
 and one of the main revenues of the hong kong government is by land
sales
and if our retail prices are going to drop this is going to be
one very important factor that will affect hong kong ' s economy as a
whole 
secondly the intellectual property factors 
we are aware that the intellectual property regulations in china is
insufficient and if people are going to start buying houses in china 
and if people are start going to divert their base to china what will
happen is there will be an encouragement of intellectual property
infringement
and what does this do
uhm we can see the regulations of pirated cds 
we can see regulations of censorships on books
these these regulations are insufficient in china and what we
are telling you is that this will be one of the most important
economic problems uh that is the intellectual property infringement 
and finally the local retail business
this should be very obvious 
things are cheap in china and this twenty-four hour border
crossing what it will do is that it will it will destroy the local
retail business
people have a tendency to buy these cheaper things in china 
especially the shops that is near the border line
and what does this do
it is a greatly effects the local retail business in hong kong
as my captain has mentioned and as my following speaker will also
mention hong kong is to keep its is to maintain its competitives 
 competitiveness in in a world-wide basis
and after the handover we will promise we will promise autonomy
and one of the most important autonomy is the economic autonomy
and what this twenty-four hour border crossing will do it is it
will it will infringe our competitiveness within the economic factor 
and therefore we believe that this twenty- four hour pro uh
border crossing will do more harm than good especiallies especially
in economic terms
what the negative side see is that there are certain demands for
the twenty-four hour border crossing
for example some businessmen they found it more convenient if
there is a twenty-four hour border crossing
but what they are not seeing is that there is insufficient need
for this twenty-four hour border crossing and their their advantages do
not outweigh the harms that will happen if this border crossing is to 
is to be implemented
and what we are saying and what my speech has brought you is
the most important harm that will affect hong kong and that is economic
problems 
and this is one of the most obvious and concrete harms that
will lead that will that will lead to problems because of the twenty-four
hour border crossing and that is why we believe this motion should
stand
thank you 
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
before elaborating my sp my sp speech i ' d
like to do some rebuttal first 
the affirmative side suggested that the the property prices
will decrease if this policy is impl implemented 
and the underlying assumption of them is they equate the
equality of hong kong houses and the china houses
and i would like to point out that hon when people try
to consider whether they choose to live in china or in hong kong they
have many factors to affect the decision that is the education
quality and also the medicare medical care quality
the medical care quality and also education qualities in china is
not as best a a a as good as hong kong and so
 many people will choose to stay in hong kong to live because all these
aspect
and the second point it mention is about the crime rate
they say that if this policy is impl implemented more
crime rate will increase
however they fail to give to prove to give evidence to prove
the dilec direct link between the two 
and the second and the third point it mention about the
intellectual infringement in china and back to hong kong 
but actually the real case is even in the daytime these
is still occur because not every single travelers are checked by the
by the by the custom and so we think that th the argument is
cannot stand 
and now i ' m going to further elaborate the benefits brought by
this policy in the economic prospect 
first of all our captain has emphasized at the very beginning
after handover there is a stron stronger tie between hong
kong and china and the globalization is the world trend
after china enter the wto that we foresee that there
will be more interaction between china and hong kong especially the pearl
river delta 
and it is too narrow-minded to consider china as a competitor
in order to boost our economy we should consider china as a
competitor uh as a as a cooperator as a trading partner and this can
achieve the win-win situation 
the twenty-four hour border crossing policy can facilitate the
increasing trading between hong kong and china 
in long term hong kong can supply technicians professionals
 investors for china 
and also on the other hand china can supply cheap land and
also labor for hong kong 
we foresee that in the future more people will be working in
china and there will be more investment in china from hong kong and
so there will be more travelers to go from china to hong kong or china or
hong kong to china 
and this policy the twenty-four hours border crossing policy 
can bring a lot of convenience to these businessmen and working people 
they can save times because they do not have to stay overnight
in china or in hong kong 
in long term this can facilitate the the increasing trading
 between the two region 
and the second one word benefits that can be
brought by this policy is the boosting in tourism 
in the present time the every year there are seventy to
eighty billion people going to china and this trend is going to be
increasing in the future 
if this policy the twenty-four hour border crossing implements 
hong kong can acts as a middle-stop for people who wants to go to china
this can increase the flow of people and the travelers across hong
kong and this can make a boost in the ec in the tourism in hong
kong and this can bring a lot of revenues in hotel industry 
retail industry and also food industry and this can brought a lot of
revenues to hong kong 
so today ' s motion should not should not stand because
hong kong can bring a lot of that hong kong can receive a lot of benefits
from this policy
thank you
