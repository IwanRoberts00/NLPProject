after twenty two years of legal practice i took a recent pledge
into politics
""
my decision to run in the december by-election for the vacant hong
kong island legislative council seat came as a surprise to many not the least
to myself and my family
""
indeed i was recently invited to give a talk and the topic set for
me was the legislative council why bother
""
about three years ago while i was the chairman of the bar a reporter
asked me whether i would ever get into politics my response at the time was a
very prompt and a very resolute no
""
the reporter much wiser than i was laughed and advised me that one
should never be that definite about such questions
""
many of you would say that being chairman of the bar was unavoidably
political
""
but to many lawyers this is never a problem
""
just because law and politics do overlap that does not mean that we
should refrain from speaking out on issues which we rightly and proudly
regard as falling within our duty as lawyers
""
by that i mean matters relating to the rule of law and the
administration of justice
""
so if we have to stage a silent march against the npc
interpretation if we have to defend the right of abode seekers if we have to
question the department of justice on its prosecution or non- prosecution
policy if we have to speak out on freedom of assembly we do not regard these
as being politically inclined
""
so why this sudden change
""
indeed why bother when veteran politicians have chosen to give up
""
i can do no better than quote the answer given by the ex-legislator
christine loh when asked about it
""
she was reported to say audrey is fresh enough to bash her head
against the wall a few times
""
when asked to endorse my candidacy for the purpose of my
by-election advertisement christine wrote i support her also because she has
an enormous capacity to learn
""
in other words her reasons can be summed up in one word green
""
incidentally that was what i chose for my campaign colour
""
but seriously to come back to the question why bother
""
when mulling over the decision as to whether i should do it i
consulted others
""
one ex-legislator said yes there is a point in legco
""
it is an intense political arena on which the glare of public
lights is focused
""
i agree with him
""
years ago when there was no recording device in the courts the
judges could behave atrociously and there was little recourse
""
now with the recording in all the courts judges have to put on
their best behaviour
""
if they don't you can complain and the evidence is all down in the
transcript and on tape
""
legco serves a similar function
""
the glare of publicity ensures that the government put on its best
behaviour
""
officials can be called on to account for their deeds and to
explain their policies
""
more importantly through the process the public gets to know and
comment on the actions and intentions of government
""
so legco is a stage where public opinion can be created or public
scrutiny exercised
""
and that is what makes a democratic society
""
talking about public opinion i must say the public does not have a
very high opinion of legco
""
the voter turnout rate is far from satisfactory
""
but this is a vicious circle
""
the more you shun the system the worse it becomes
""
you can only go one way and that is down
""
many professionals do not believe in direct election
""
the businessmen even less so
""
they think it favours the grassroots
""
they prefer the functional constituencies
""
but so long as that remains an alternative we are never going to
progress towards direct election of all seats in legco the ultimate goal as
set by the basic law
""
it is important that we have more people willing to run in direct
elections
""
of course i confess that when the proposition was first put to me
my first reaction was not to run uh but to run away
""
and that was my second and my third reaction as well
""
but in the end i have to be true to myself
""
i could not say direct election is a good thing but no not for me
""
put to the test i could not say no
""
what tickled the media during my campaign was the number of
professionals who rallied to the cause
""
they came in large numbers to the housing estates visits to the
streets to the rallies to the tea houses in their three piece suits some in
their bow ties and many with their briefcases
""
they were  they  awkward and slightly embarrassed when
distributing leaflets and addressing the passers-by through the microphones
but they all did that in the best spirit
""
i was pleasantly surprised when some very senior doctors who are
the most conservative when it comes to politics or advertising agreed to lend
their names to very large newspaper advertisement to endorse my candidacy
""
many who voted this time confessed that they have never voted
before
""
for the good of hong kong we must encourage more people that legco
is an institution worth bothering about
""
legco has presented a new dimension to my legal training
""
take the bills committee
""
in the past i look at the finished piece of legislation arguing
with the judge as to what it is supposed to mean
""
now i look at it during its making as to what it should mean
""
but i enjoy best the work that goes on outside legco
""
this is the district work or what i would rather call the community
work
""
a lawyer can only offer legal remedies but these are often costly
and time consuming
""
it is hardly the answer for the man in the street who now turns up
in my legco office
""
however i may be able to bring about the solution after discussion
with the relevant government department
""
this can be far more efficient than any number of judicial review
applications
""
in a way legco provide a platform to cooperate with administration
to improve to become more transparent more equitable and more efficient
""
i  ' m also tapping onto the support shown by professionals during
the campaign
""
in time with their help i hope to build up a professional aid
centre for consumers
""
we are still at the very early stage of developing the one country
two systems concept
""
whether the two systems will thrive under the one country and what
degree of high autonomy we are going to have depend not just on what beijing
is prepared to give but also on what we in hong kong are prepared to fight
and stand up for
""
thus there is every reason for each and every one of us to be
bothered whether in taking up public office casting our vote expressing our
opinion or even just taking an interest in the affairs of hong kong
""
we should all take part be  it  a very small part in shaping
our destiny and our future 
""
""
""
in the last policy address for his first term mr tung
announced the framework for what he called the accountability system for
principal officials
""
although he said it is for the next chief executive to decide yet
it is no secret that decide for second term
""
mr tung skillfully camouflaged what is really far reaching
constitution and political reform as merely administrative measures to
improve efficiency and public accountability
""
he said the study was within the parameters of the basic law
""
there was no mention of public consultation
""
in short this so called accountability system is sure to come in
his next term
""
the new system can be briefly described as follow
""
in addition to the top three secretaries the chief secretary
financial secretary and secretary for justice there will be other policy
secretaries each with a specific policy area
""
they will be appointed and removed by the central peoples'
government from the recommendation of the chief executive
""
they will be employed on contract for term no longer than the term
of the chief executive
""
they will be political appointments and not part of the civil
service
""
directly under and responsible to them will be the heads of bureau
who will remain civil servants
""
how will these policy secretaries differ from the senior officials
under the present system
""
of course they will be better paid but that is hardly reason for
change
""
the major change is that they are no longer civil servants
""
they can be removed at the will of the chief executive
""
and how will this change bring about a more accountable system
""
in any democratic society when you talk about accountability you
mean accountability to the people not the chief executive especially if the
chief executive is selected by a small circle of only eight hundred people
""
in the states the policy secretaries have to be endorsed by
congress which is elected by popular mandate
""
in united kingdom the minister is selected from amongst popularly
elected members of parliament
""
even in the peoples ' republic of china as provided in article sixty
two of the constitution senior officials are endorsed by the national
peoples ' congress
""
so let me come back to the question how will these policy
secretaries who are no longer civil servants and who can be removed at the
will of the chief executive become more accountable to the hong kong public
""
the secretary for constitutional affairs mr michael suen had a
hard time trying to explain this
""
he said because these policy secretaries would be public servants
rather than civil servants they have to be responsible for their policies so
they would listen more attentively to the wishes of the public
""
i couldn't help laughing
""
does that mean that the secretaries and policy chiefs we have now
are not responsible or less responsible for their policies
""
whatever one may think of their abilities no one can seriously
suggest that they are not trying hard just because they cannot be dismissed
from their jobs
""
secondly with active media the political parties ngos and frequent
polls it is absurd to suggest that the government does not know what the
public wants
""
thus it is difficult to see why and how these super secretaries can
make a difference
""
moreover his when the legislative council passed the motion of no
confidence in the director of housing last year he not only remained intact
within the civil service and without any censure he was not even transferred
from his posting with the housing authority
""
there were also similar motions against rosanna wong elsie leung
and andrew lo
""
while it is true that the motions were not passed in the case of
the latter two mr tung  ' s reaction at the time amply demonstrated that he
was far from ready to accept political judgment on his senior officials
""
when mr suen was quizzed about these incidents by one caller
during a phone in programme he would only say that he hoped similar incidents
would not recur
""
mr suen could not really explain how or when these policy
secretaries can be held responsible for their mistakes
""
he said that they would not be so thick skinned as to insist on
stay in the face of severe public criticism
""
let us consider how a policy secretary can be held accountable
""
if something does go wrong the fault may not lie with the policy
itself but with the civil servants who are supposed to implement the policy
""
administrative inefficiency at the lower ranks will not improve
just by creating one super secretary at the top
""
let us assume it is the fault of the policy
""
take the policy to build eighty five thousand flats a year
""
this was widely criticized as one of the reasons for the property
market crash
""
does that mean that the policy secretary for housing should be
held accountable and therefore dismissed from his job
""
take education
""
there is much consensus that quality of education has gone down
and one fundamental problem is the large class size
""
how do we expect our teachers to teach students coming from
different bands and with different learning capacities when a class is as big
as forty or even forty five students
""
indeed the education commission had recommended as long ago as
nineteen ninety three that we should gradually reduce the class size
""
yet when mr tung became the chief executive in nineteen ninety
seven he wanted to develop full day schools and the move to reduce class size
was not only shelved but the class size has to be increased in the recent
years
""
parents clearly hold contrary beliefs
""
rather than put their children in full day government and subsided
schools many of them save and scrap and scramble to put their kids in
expensive international schools where the class size is much smaller
""
do we hold the secretary for education and manpower responsible
for not listening to the views of the public
""
mr tung may be thinking of appointing some legislators to the
executive council party leaders who will deliver and carry the votes in the
legislative council needed by the government
""
with the present set up in the legislative council he can well
afford to ignore the democratic elements there and still manage to get a
majority for the policies he wishes to implement
""
this will mean that political bargaining can be made at the level
of the executive council
""
by the time any proposal comes to legislative council it will be a
fait accompli with the votes secured for its passage
""
with the creation of super secretaries and a reformed executive
council mr tung will have the strong executive led government that he  ' s
always hoped for
""
i cannot see how accountability will be enhanced with appointment
of super secretaries on the chief executive  ' s sole recommendation
""
it can only be a consolidation of  path  by a person who  ' s
selected on a very narrow mandate
""
to describe this as an accountability system is not only a
misnomer it is a reflection of mr tung  ' s idea of accountability
""
the truth is unless and until the chief executive is elected by
universal suffrage unless and until the general public has the right to vote
a government in and out of office it is hardly meaningful simply to talk
about accountability of principal officials
