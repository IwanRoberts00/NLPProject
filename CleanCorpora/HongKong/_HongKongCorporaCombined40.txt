and have some tea and coffee and then some bailey ' s afterwards and they are going to play monopoly but uhm i have to go home   to do something     did you leave late at night  no actually it ' s slightly afternoon you know they they they they they want to see this mo piano but uhm    okay  the the movie called the piano   yah   aw    i saw that too when i was in canada it ' s okay a few words  yeah well i want to see it but you know so far you ' ve seen it andrew hated it you know so i mean     well i don't think he hates it that just because he went with his parents and second of all because he was sitting quite in front of the movie theatre   uh yeah  uh huh  it ' s like only one hour and something you know i was sitting you know on the third row in schindler ' s list for three hours you know that try to imagine my my neck you know like cracking uh just literally cracking after three hours and stuff like that     the screen is very near   but you know how to play piano  yeah yeah   it will be interesting for you to see the film  oh yeah     you you ' ve seen it  yes i ' ve seen it oh you ' ve seen it yes so there ' s there are lot of playing of piano in the film  very elegant yes very elegant  do you think so  wow </[1 >    uhm uhm  yeah like that the person whose is uhm mute she can hear but   yah  she cannot speak   she cannot speak and so in order her for her to communicate she does it to the piano cos her expression you know help her to   uh huh  i wish i could do that but i can never made it you know in the piano i mean it will be even difficult for me to follow the original score you know if you want me to compose you that express by emotions through the music i ' ll be you know pretty difficult to do that yeah   yeah could you imagine that that a few words  in that movie won the best uh supporting actor   the supporting actor  yes the academy award     the oscar award  oscar  yeah yes   and she ' s doing the eleven musical  and she ' s from new zealand  uhm uhm   aw  she was like so shock and she ' s sound of panting    have you seen the oscar   yeah i see that her live that morning you know because i was at home you know yeah i see it live she ' s really good uh but i don't like whoopi goldberg she ' s the the mc this year i mean usually it ' s like uh billy crystal do that  so tut don't really     uhm uhm   apparently the kid who did home alone macauley  culkin he was supposed to do that mc as well but be but uhm his father got the outline of the uhm of the script   oh yes  right   of how the oscar can be presented  uh huh   and one of whoopi goldberg ' s line went uhm so your dad to macauley culkin so your dad look pretty bad these days didn't he and uhm he ' s not a few words  he got very upset and withdrew his uhm from the oscar   he ' s not quite pleased   all right  you know like actually macauley culkin he was presenting uh the award to somebody and there you know he ' s like so mature you know you know he ' s like only how how how old is he     he ' s probably twelve years old  yeah i mean you know it ' s imagine a kid stands in such a big occasion and he ' s just saying that a normal stuff you know like presenting aw you know now i we uh we ' re now going to present blah blah blah blah blah it ' s like so surprised to see such a kid you know behaving so mature you know sophisticated in front of everybody surprise me huh yeah i mean you know it ' s like precocious kid you know because the little kid     because he ' s a kid  yeah yeah yeah sometimes sca this kind of ides just scare you huh    uhm  yeah  how hollywood train those kids you know to become a adult you know   what did you think about uhm the best foreign film award category like the farewell my concubine and the wedding banquet and the some other movie and then and in the end this spanish film i can't remember the name of it but that film won the oscar i though it should have been farewell my concubine   yeah  or or or or the wedding banquet you know but i mean   have you seen both  i ' ve seen farewell my concubine not the wedding banquet but i mean i really like that movie i was crying you know i mean with my friend you know it ' s so funny we ' re sitting in this cinema and they you know when you know it it ' s talking about you when those kids you know who were trained to be a a peking opera singer you know in their in their in their childhood you know they were beaten by the you know so-called the you know fathers the father figure of this those teachers you know and ours like s you know i was crying you know and then it ' s in the dark and then i was searching my bag for my tissue and then suddenly my friend just you know she just give this handkerchief give me another one you know she was crying as well you know so we cried a lot     uhm uhm   so you got a tissue from her hand   no no     is she crying and one-word a tissue and gave it to you  no no i was se searching my bag for my tissue and i got one right and she said she is asking me for another one because she was crying at the same time i didn't notice you know which is you know very quietly you know our tears floating down of our face you know we didn't make a lot of sound and noises stuff like that yeah    oh uh uh uh  how about you have you seen that movie as well  no i haven't seen that what about wedding banquet no no you even     oh you ' ve missed the best film  yes it was really great isn't it i mean i heard you know the wedding banquet is really really good   oh i saw it  you uh did you see it   yes i have  aw   i saw the film  yeah how come i mean you know they didn't get award i mean two chinese yeah   you know i think it probably uhm was more like a political statement  it is uh     because my sister has seen this spanish film and she also seen farewell my concubine and the wedding banquet and she said that farewell my concubine is much better than and it ' s like wedding banquet is excellent as well but it shouldn't have been that farewell my concubine should have won the award now i think of more a political statement because obviously   the american are presenting oscar and they present one to china and you know like really    there ' s   yeah  they are into this trade you know whatever you know     di diplomatic strategy     yeah    so obviously i think the more of uhm hidden agenda  it is all it ' s not fair you know like last year is that last year that uh red lantern and something and then you know the year before is ju dou you know they never never get any chance to getting this award even the other films are really not good or something like that you know   that may be a few words that ' s why  i i haven't seen that as well   you called me to watch that foreign film and then watch more chinese film which a few words interesting  i know i ' m you know like uhm uh at that time i just happened you know not very uhm uh quite occupied at that time i suppose i was having exams i don't remember otherwise i i i mean i always you know i don't like the films in hong kong locally made but you know i do have a st a very strong interest in the chinese film you know like you know by those you know zhang yi mou whatever you know  those directors ' names yeah you know so really good stuff i remember yellow yellow earth or something have you see this movie it was really really good and the red sorghum the red and then all these i mean i ' ve seen all these movie you know    uhm uhm   uhm uhm  but have you go any ticket for the hong kong international film festival  no because we are having exams one-word  here yeah it ' s so strange you know every time you know the oscar and the and the film festival you know always come when you ' re having a exam yeah every time    if i went to a few word  so you just totally you know and then you know wh i was talking to my friend ian right and he ' s you know like we we are all you know those lovers of movie great movies so every year we subscribe you know from the film festival  and every year we didn't get any tickets for it i don't know why so i mean i just this year i was totally giving you know i was totally give up

she can go to rugby seven she can get a ticket which i hardly a few words  what ' s happening to her   i don't know she is so very out-going and  is it just so amazing yeah   i think well people people know that you are new in hong kong and they probably have connection and so we ' re able to get ticket for her  yeah i mean how come you didn't get that kind of connection do you    i ' ve

that ' s why so what about the ruby seven how did she s talk about it i mean   as if uh one-word she met a party  yeah   and uhm  that spanish party   yeah that that ' s right  all right so it ' s a spanish guy huh   and this guy uhm work with bbc and  all right aw   and he was uhm saying that he had a corporate seat as a  one- word servant which is uhm the company pay for a somebody ' s seat

kong stadium   yeah the hong kong stadium yeah every year is in the hong kong stadium but you know just because of the new one it ' s because the hong kong stadium was being renovated so you know it '
