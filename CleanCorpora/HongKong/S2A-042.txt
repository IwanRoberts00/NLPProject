e-commerce will have the best potential because of the fact
e-commerce in china doesn't have any competing channels like united
 na united airline in hong kong
you wanna try try marketing you know e-commerce are winners
so whoever book the airlined on the w web would save money
the result is fifteen e effort uh traveling agents in
hong kong wallop all united airlines
they don't sell on the net okay because in tradition channels is
that they ' re kicking us away 
but in china you don't because the traditional channels so weak 
so in a way from that angle e-commerce may have a better potential 
china ' s over-research and misunderstood 
we use a paradigm very much from the west and everybody
rushing in and saying that where does the e-com coming from
everybody so poor
why could they afford all these 
or on the other hand is like several words 
more i mean uh western kind of style is that why would chinese 
consumers buy local chinese products 
we couldn't understand it 
uh global product uhm definitely much better
so so a lot of times we are observing fact that there are like uh
situation of pockets whereby uh the chinese consumers is definite over-
research but definitely not understood in right way 
mirage and reality 
about two years ago i give that talk and uh among the audience
is a general motor son senior managers
he ask me is that uh would china become the largest private car
markets in the world 
then i said uh let me answer your question with another question
 if you have only money to buy other apartment home or car which one
would you go for which one do you think the chinese would go for
now if you are coming from silicon valley in california that the
answer is very obvious 
you buy a car that you sleep there
uh in silicon valley it ' s so expensive anyway so so you ' ll
do that but in china it ' s the other way round 
so i said i mean you ask me about it the car market i think you
have to wait 
it ' s an escalation growth that is going on and finally it ' s a
reverse quality gap
uh it ' s in a way the quality gap come up with the major 
premise is saying that well uh we produce something and then the
consumers expect something higher therefore we got a quality gap
in china for the multi-nationals it ' s almost the reverse
the chinese may not be able to appreciate the quality that
is in the product themselves okay
so we ' ll we ' ll talk about that
now instead of going several words what i ' m
trying to do is i will try to f focus on three things maybe link
more to what we are talking about today and i ' ll also select all three
of them in a different perspective 
hopefully i mean does stimulating more discussion around here
 one is i ' ll look at the consumer underlying motivations 
okay we cannot when we study culture we cannot throw away 
the baby okay
that ' s the baby
the consumers are the baby
 we have the underlying motivation 
and second i ' ll move on to one of the actors in the field 
the local ch uh chinese uh firms
so in here i ' ll uh several words and talk
about hot consumption spot as arena traps and then the growth of chinese
local brands
and then i will talk about another side of the fence that is
multi-nationals 
uh what do they see and what do they do not see 
uh by the way uh uh am i am i am i doing okay
you can hear me
okay fine
uh any question you s subscribe one
word please 
so i take these three perspective and hopefully also three actors
 coming in and so on so s the rest of it several
words 
now i think the mo major uh underlying
motivation for many chinese is this 
their income is low their expenditure definitely go along with
it so it ' s gonna be bearable 
they could only afford a very humble lifestyle okay
but with all just like what we discuss about advertising
about consumption about seeing how uhm uh other people spend
their money they aspire a much higher lifestyle beyond their reach 
for many chinese the best thing uh the question that
they have whenever they do the consumption 
now then the question is that how could they live beyond the
means
a very interesting one 
do they stop there
do they just being affordable and then stay on there
no 
okay
they will try to go on to the aspired lifestyle code 
now on the other hand then how could they afford it okay
then cough my colleague and i come out with a main
look some sort of uh eight ways that they can do luxury 
uhm some of them actually cough propose
and observe bank in e east-european countries 
one is like prolonging luxury okay that is once you
acquire a particular product you want to extend it 
you take extra care of it 
uh i guess uh around here if you you you you first have your 
most nice pair of shoes okay you take extra extra care of it 
that ' s a same kind philosophy philosophy and uhm 
people actually also compare the study in uhm mcdonalds in china
versus mcdonald in united states 
uh consumers in china stays in mcdonald three times longer than
a typical american 
they go longer 
i mean they claim to go to mcdonald 
it ' s mcdonald they know its fast food 
they thought this and they would in the in the mind and said
 no not a fast food to me it ' s something more so i would stay on
so it ' s prolonging the luxury inspecting 
another one example would be sharing luxury 
they would they wouldn't mind when they travel together two
people stay in a five star hotel then each one have a three star hotel
room okay
to put the resources together okay
that ' s understandable 
we understand it
when i was a kid there was like uh at that time family is a 
cough uh it ' s s poor and uh re re i
 re i still remember that that uh even ici uh uh
icicle or i popsicle you can split it into two 
they made it in a way you can break it so you share it
so sharing luxury a lot of times is what happening uh so
that they can enjoy a different lifestyle 
another one is democratizing luxury using 
cheap substitutes like cheap champagnes 
there ' re lots of them in china 
it ' s is is a brand coming up or one word 
coming up they could not afford the normal one they go for the cheap one
uh so so that ' s another way that we look at it 
and that one is almost like leaping luxury
uhm the idea comes from the fact that the maslow has a very nice
 linear dependency model
you get the survivors and then you socialize you get actualize
and whatever it is 
uh but you look at that to be two words 
uh they may look n nice but they go hungry and then
there is uhm i think uhm a play somewhere in east uh europe
they are saying that is is the the the the the title of the play ' s
overcoat
there ' s somebody actually selling off everything in order to
protect his overcoat not being sold
uh under that circumstances that that poor guy actually uh
fainting on the street or some sor some sort of die in the end
but then they want to look nice
i mean for them is leaping ahead
uh it ' s unfortunately is looking more materialistic but
nonetheless that ' s the reality
so we are talking about in some senses many of them many of the
chinese people they trade off some of the necessities for
something that they can actualize or they can associate with the social
status 
another one going along is privatizing luxury 
they use private vans local bike vans okay
so in shengzhen right now or guangzhou you can buy all of these
vans and so on anything you want 
you want this shirt look like a nike one or uh uhm uh uh
 two words you just buy the brand and stick it on
that ' s fine
uh then you go to like uh private labels i mean many of them s
 so those uh look-alike vans have a lot of uh uh customers for that
reason
even though the customs continue to crack down or the
intellectual property right continue to do so as well 
another one is escalating luxury 
right if they are in that particular level and then they need
a much higher level to go into just like when they are riding bike
 you ' re asking them to sell them an apartment ' s worth of a car
now that ' s that ' s that ' s quite a big jump okay
so where where where somewhere in-between 
well the somewhere in-between would be mopeds motor cycles
scooters and so on 
so if now you travel in china about thirty percent in the
cities are replacing the motorbike uh the bicycle with motorbikes 
it ' s no kidding 
when i go up into guangzhou now from nine to five no
motorcycle in the city 
 the respect there are so many of them 
there is the there is uh escalating the curve well escalating first 
motorcycle and then maybe the bike 
and of course that curve is also changing too because that
back in home right now in china i spend much more expensive than ever before
so they move up the curve 
i ' ll i ' ll from the affordable to to the less affordable kind of
area when the cars are moving down the dropping price by thirty 
to sometimes forty percent 
so if you ask me the same question now right now is the saying
that would china become the uh world ' s uh largest private car market 
i would say it depends on the price 
if you continue to escalate downwards there would be a point
 where a lot of people would be buying cars 
and of course the service station many other things have to
come along with it 
now that ' s the e escalating luxury and the last one is
glimpsing luxury 
it ' s that they wouldn't have time to do it all the time but
on the other hand they do it once in a while 
so it ' s when i talk to the heineken uh manager she is
saying that only if it is ju like one of twenty beers is
heineken is fine 
it ' s a good market point 
they could not demand that every time they go to a a bar or
have a drink outside they would go for heineken
it ' s it ' s it ' s ridiculous 
but nonetheless one in twenty is not too bad 
so that ' s the some of the motivation behind it 
now what about the firms uhm 
how am i doing on the timing
how much time several words 
okay okay
just buzz me if i am going over okay
now cough what about the firm ' s strategies
now the firm ' s strategy is a very interesting one 
here likes an example of value engineering 
now what is what engineering is this in order to create more
value for the customer 
now so they they are looking for prolonging the luxury right
they want to stay longer 
so you want to stretch it out longer for them
that ' s what 
so that ' s what we call in marketing value engineering 
engineering more things of value to the customers itself
now the other one is sharing luxury
remember breaking the ice popsicle 
we we package apart cut it smaller smaller size so that
they can take it on their own 
democratic democratizing luxury 
one way is sub-brand so instead of just selling at that level
 going down the curve going down the curve because they are
looking for cheaper products 
so you have to go down your 
now another one is very interesting value engineering gain 
uhm in marketing we always call something as a core product
 like a cup of coffee the coffee would be the core product and
then yo the cup itself is a peripheral and then de 
 de design the cup is another peripheral and then the stirrer is
another peripheral
uhm things are on top of it 
we in in a way is looking at it is by increasing or e 
 expanding the core with peripherals 
we ' re actually we help the values up 
now that was in a developed economy 
now once you have this huge product with the core and wi
 on all the peripherals you stuck it into an emerging market like
mainland china 
the other way round would be you unfold it 
you take off the peripherals 
they don't need it okay
for example how many of you in the room knows one hundred
percent all the function of vcr 
i don't okay 
now so so in a way it ' s decomposing it take it off
i mean some of things are are not useful 
i mean the packaging we did it in beautiful packaging but in
mainland china they don't care about packaging 
they just want the product 
you do it in a delivery way
they said no no no no i can ride my bike and took home my
tv 
so you don't deliver it to me i took it off okay
so all of a sudden we are talking about a very interesting phe
 uh phenomenon
it ' s called naked product 
you take it all those things take it off become a naked
product approach 
so there would be something that democratizing in order
if somebody is trying to democratizing you want to hit them back with lower
price appropriate product you are redesigning the whole uh price
attribute model in terms of value engineering 
now what about lux leaping luxury
again the same thing and of course we also hit with uh a major
 moral issue whether we are ethical or not okay
uh say for example coca cola and pepsi has always been hit with
this 
in the developing countries they are selling nothing but some
unhealthy like uh uh elements put in t water
 and then replacing some of the nutritions uh kind of drinks and so on
i mean there ' s marketing uh of that uh ethics and so on
but of course many people say uh there is lot of power behind
the whole thing and how would you feel 
uh remember i saw a uh an interview with the ceo and
said how do you feel that so much power so much resources so
much energy put in just a simple product as coke and the
answer is how wonderful is that okay
so it ' s ethical issue coming in
remember us we are leaping luxury and that
whether we are moving people around on that basis
privatizing luxury 
now you are looking at that then the factory outlet and
sub-branding make sense okay
now if you are people are privatizing is that they could not
afford it 
they honestly could not afford 
then why don't you sell them at the factory outlet of the b
grade product that is the product that do not need the one hundred 
quality control level and they would be your customers in the
future
