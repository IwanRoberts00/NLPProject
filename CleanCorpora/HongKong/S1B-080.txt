<I>
so basically i anticipate this is coming because hong kong as
in during the last few years it was really like a bubble
the salary was so high and uh especially when you ' re reporting to
australia when few years back the currency exchange rate was so low
you really making a lot more money than your boss in australia so it
it had to happen
so they they cut it and then they put hire a local chinese speaking
person in australia which is maybe only one-quarter of what they were pay me
and this guy come up to china one trip a year and then everything else is
done by telephone or email
so i see it coming so uh that ' s it
and now it ' s a time uh i actually when i came over this morning i
was looking at you know really thinking about what my approach would be to
the job market and i was thinking maybe instead of looking for full time or
long term employment at forty nine so i ' m thinking of maybe really going for
a five to six years employment you know really to be number one to work
as a sales manager and then also uh outright you will be doing a lot 
of facilitating training up the com people successor 
succeeding you and uh 
i think at my age i have to take something uh some approach like
that to really maybe able to find something come along
i don't know
really if you ' re talking about at forty nine looking for a uh
competing with people at you know at thirty at thirty then i can understand
you know it ' s going to be very very difficult situation
so my approach would be really on the on the onset tell them you ' re
only looking for five to six years employment and you will be helping to
start to set up a operation uh or facilitating training your
successor something like that
that i think is uh i can put some value into uh my approach
so this is your idea
 you have you haven't started yet
 yes 
okay
tony tony tony you don't have to worry about that you being
forty nine
 there are at least three people in this room that ' s
forty nine in age 
 right 
 forty nine raise your hand
so don't don't have don't have don't look
at the age ceiling
 they they 
no they doesn't
 yes 
 yes 
because to be honest with you 
no to be honest with you if i were the one hiring people 
 i would have reservation hiring a forty nine year
old also right 
 several words 
 yes 
 yes 
 it really depends on what level that you ' re
applying for
well even if you are apart of course if you ' re
really you know looking for uh a political job you ' re only a beginner 
 you know you can talk about 
 yeah you can start something called the forty
 niners okay
all three one word and
don't worry about that one being mechanical engineer i am
engine 
 uh 
 good we we are the group of that yeah
if the market is really good then if they ' re looking
for general manager uhm level like that then it ' s different
 but now you have to go for
 uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 but for entry level it is different difficult 
 even for middle level 
 yes 
 but i i share one thing with
uh with tony uh i because i was in canada also working for five years got my
 po passport and i came back hong kong in ninety three already
and i feel that the the the local culture here hong kong
i was born in hong kong anyway that there there are certain you
know unlisted rules of uh age discrimination when they see
your your your cv you know there especially among local chinese
or chinese related family companies 
they they have that mentality but we have to overcome
that you know
we in fact we can bring a lot of experience as i can just
hear from what tony just said
you have excellent english you can be a trainer in sales 
in your area 
 uh 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yes 
 yeah that uh that exactly what i i i
want 
 and i i don't say that you have you know you can
have uh ten years twenty years of uh what uh what what we call por 
portfolio life 
if you still have your career you know it ' s not just five years
you know don't limit yourself on on on that
and i think maybe the on the on the part of the employer they they
may give you a contract of two years maybe one year even
take it
yeah
because i think it ' s two way traffic
it ' s not just the the the employer picking picking the
candidates they are as worry as us in picking the right people perfect match
the perfect match
so i i think i don't know i i don't know what i can share here but
i i am highly still i meet a number of people since the nineteen of
this month and i am sending out emails like hell and i contacting a
few headhunters so i ' m i i at your age i am 
 right 
 i know
i know i mean it ' s not really the forty nine but what
i ' m saying is you know in the job market that ' s real i
meant the reality 
i mean that the other part of it is our financial
secretary is over fifty he just become a new father so i mean
it ' s it ' s different uhm this is different 
 uh 
 yes 
 yes 
 yes 
 yes 
 that ' s his own business we don't care about
 that 
 yeah 
 right but right but anyway differ
 different different situation but you know real
world if you are forty nine applying for a new job it ' s going to be 
a lot more difficult than a thirty years old 
 we really don't give a damn about that 
 yes 
 age is always an issue okay who
 won't get old 
every everyone will get old one day will die one day
 so there is no exception
the point is okay when we are say forty eight or forty nine or
forty five we got at least more than fifteen years of experience
what people expect are they pay you and then they want to you to
contribute value right away but they don't expect learning that ' s the point
i mean so what i ' m saying is is that uh if we can convince
people that we can contribute uhm value okay what they call value is
making money or cutting the costs 
 yes 
 everybody two words exact yes 
 yes 
 the problem is how you get through the hr 
 you know the 
 i mean 
i ' m i mean
every time they just screen all of it the 
 letters 
 uhm 
 i mean this this is not 
only happening in hong kong
 this is also happening in in in new
york in in chicago in london
 uh ha 
 yes 
yeah i i know
i mean i mean the the world is
uhm changing
is changing over a period of three years
i mean uhm so what what what we should look at is at the at this
point in time we should be marketing our skills as fiercely as possible 
 and then right and then
and then forget about age
 sure 
 yeah 
 so okay 
but you can't
look look if if if if you discriminate on me on age fine
thank you very much then i go elsewhere sure 
 i ' m not saying but you you know you have 
 to as i ' ve said if you ' re forty nine then what i ' m saying is
maybe you need a different approach that ' s what i ' m trying to say
 it does it 
 yes yes 
i suggest we don't dwell on this uh 
 right 
okay
 okay probably they are one word 
yes yes 
 leisurely leisurely uhm 
 two words 
 rebecca 
 interesting part 
yeah i ' m rebecca i ' m 
 uhm rebecca sorry
it ' s okay
yeah you can two words 
and uhm i work in a financial services industry for quite a long
time and mainly in banks uh over over fif fifteen years
uh after i graduate from uh united states and during my uh you
know my career path line i see all the changes in the banking industry
financial industry and lots of them one word merging uh
downsize or they call it right size and sort of the things
and uhm so uhm i uh i came i i lost my job uh last year uh
from a very large bank and uhm at that time well actually i join the bank uhm
in nine in twen two two thousand one
in two thousand one i was uhm uh recruited by the headhunter to
join the bank
but after join after joining the bank for a uh a few months uh
they change
i joined the bank as a uh product marketing specialist and and
then they had to restructure
restructuring and uhm the division that that i ' m under uhm no
longer to put the resources to the product and so they terminate the position
and i ' m outing 
but i saw all these you know there there there there all these
just happen to happen happen you know and uhm like uhm uhm even though you
know uhm if you have the job one day and find it sounds very promising and
the next day because uhm the bank or the back the or organization no longer
sees it as the their core business they they may sell it or just close down
the the the team that ' s all and then you will lose the job
 uhm 
business decision
yeah this is business decision not your personal problem 
 and uhm uhm today uhm the the market is quite difficult you
know
uhm when i ' m given in the financial services i i found that like
you you know uh most of the vacancies are just insurance sales
