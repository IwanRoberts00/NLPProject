 cantonese translation recording fast-forwards 
now do you know whether the incorporated owners of

drainage pipe recording fast-forwards 
uh perhaps i 
 it may well be a legal question as well
 
uhm 
it may well be a legal question as well 
 
 well let ' s a few words uhm
can i rephrase this uh question in this
 
all right
are you but the evidence i ' ve got so far as far as i recalled
this not been challenged 
uhm
 
it is of these where drainage pipes outside the door 
that ' s part i understand
 
all right
so presumably they will form part of the common part 
of the into which the core figure right owners will be responsible under the
ordinance if not under the deed of mutual governance two words
 
 uhm 
yes your honour perhaps i can re 
 
 but the question who is responsible for cleaning the
made the payment upon what is the contract between the plaintiffs and the
corporate owners 
uhm
 
because uh i think my recollection there ' s one of the items uhm
 well i thought perhaps it isn't expressed 
it wasn't expressed in item two of these evid 
 
 or is it the pleading case to begin with
uhm and then they ' ve got three various thing about lots of other
thing
checking all the storage condition two words 
uhm twenty hours per service
uhm they become may be now replaced with two
words well well these are all extras which the plaintiff had
 two words charged a few words 
 yes 
uhm perhaps i i i should rephrase my question
 
yeah i think perhaps you can put it in another way 
 yeah 
 
and if if the only question is whether this is false part of the
common part i don't think it will be any dispute about this do you
i don't recall you challenging 
uh your honour the 
 
 mr wong ' s evidence so this was for the outside
pipes 
your honour what we uhm your honour will recall that in the
entire evidence of mr wong he has not in fact dealt with this particular item

can you a few words 
yes your honour sure but recording fast-forwards 
it ' s my omission because of the amount of invoice
i do apologise but i your honour i i shall read those

word just as working on you see i see that the the the cheque used
to own by foreign curtain et cetera

yes indeed
 
uhm right may be before i three words you
might have some favourite one word to the defendant

yeah
 
uhm it seems to be a standard charged 
yes

seem to be with this one was covered by the one word 
your honour is quite right
uh perhaps uh mr loong can i can i draw your attention to anther
document
page thirty six recording fast-forwards 
in the plaintiff ' s
now please look at the content of this document and tell us when
you have finished cantonese translation recording fast-forwards
now please tell us whether there was any arrangement between
the management committee and the plaintiff company concerning the work
referred to in this document recording fast-forwards 
 
yes 
can you please tell us what was the arrangement
 
every month eight hundred dollars would be charged for 
cleaning of any pipe 
undoubted this part of part of the pipe that my learned
friend is not challenging being part of the common pipes so
 
you said every month eight hundred dollars will be charged that
was whether or not the pipes needed cleaning cantonese translation
 recording fast-forwards 
 
yes recording fast-forwards 
tell us why the management committee is agreeable to such an
 arrangement 
 
 well is that to my concerned recording
fast-forwards 
well my learned friend is asking me to stick to and part of
my case is on quantum meruit basis and the charges must be reasonable
uhm there must be a reason in support of the charges whether 
 or not 
 
 but see i mentioned this last week i i mean i ' m
now hear what you have to say about a few words later on
but you may have some difficulty to a quantum meruit case cos the evidence
shows something was expressly agreed both what should be done and its amount
yes your honour
 
different different fact which you expressly agreed work should
be done without agreement that had made as to the cost thereof 
yeah your honour as i as far i can see the there are two
alternative parts in the plaintiff ' s case one is that there was an expressed
ad hoc agreement as such concerning the uh pipes which is over and a 
above the budget
 
that ' s not the plaintiff ' s case
the plaintiff ' s case is you owe us money partly because of the
expressed agreement in writing eighth of june eighty nine as you paid out to
honour the debit one word submitted
 two words alternative there are certain
items which we were talking three words quantum meruit
basis
did you ask us to do from time to time
the difficulty you may a few words i ' m not
saying there ' s more to state 
uhm
 
uh it is that it seems to be the subject matter no second
agreement recording fast-forwards 
yes
 
uh uh what they agreed in fact in fact is the case 
mr loong then could you assist us to see if you can
remember since when was this arrangement came into operation 
cantonese translation recording fast-forwards 
 
indeed all right i can't remember 
mr loong i appreciate that we are talking about the matters
 years ago
i ' m not asking you to remember the exact date
at least you can try to see if you can give us some idea as to
roughly the year or roughly whether it was before or after the present
management contract whether it was close to the commencement of the
occupation of this building
or give us some idea by references
some some dates or terms cantonese translation 
recording fast-forwards 
 
i can't remember 
 
tell tell us the recording fast-forwards 
 
sometimes in eighty seven i think 
and roughly when did the plaintiff start i oblige to
 
yes 
when did the plaintiff start managing this building 
recording fast-forwards 
 
also sometime in eighty seven cantonese answer 
 
that is uh since the establishment of our committee a
long pause 
 and uh 
 
 did did you were you responsible selecting the
plaintiff company recording fast-forwards 
 
as well 
 
yes recording fast-forwards 
now the drainage problem of chat gei 
name of a shop was it something that that uh cut them off
was it a problem that surfaced very soon after you took up your
post as the chairman or was it something that happened uh later in the course
of managing this building recording fast-forwards 
 
uh the pipes at chat gei and foreign were two
special trouble pipes 
 
when did the troubles start 
yeah
 
i beg your pardon 
 
when did the trouble with these pies start cantonese
translation recording fast-forwards 
 
before i became the chairman 
and do do you remember after becoming the chairman did
you try to tackle this problem soon after your election
or did you only try it months later recording fast-forwards
 
after the election 
and in order to deal with this problem did you discuss with
the plaintiff company recording fast-forwards 
 
yes 
and what was the result of such discussion event 
recording fast-forwards 
 
at the initial stage whenever the pipe was blocked it would be
cleared immediately
and then uhm we had to pay charges depending on how many uh times
the pipe had been cleaned
later as we had no idea how many times the pipe would burst in a
month so it was agreed that an amount would be paid monthly for all
the cleanings in the month 
now perhaps you can then help us
can you tell us roughly the time gap between the first arrangement
of charging per cleaning and then the subsequent arrangement of a fixed
charge per month
 
a short period of time cantonese answer 
 
only uh a few months time 
thank you 
now when
 
sorry could i just recording fast-forwards 
 
uhm even there was no repair work still we had to pay the amount
 recording fast-forwards 
 
charged the fixed sum for all the cleanings in the month 
 
yes that ' s what i assume
thank you
 and two words we had to pay
 
 uh recording fast-forwards 
uh please turn to page thirty eight please cantonese
translation 
of the plaintiff ' s bundle
 
sorry thirteen or thirty 
thirty eight

translation recording fast-forwards 
now tell us whether there was any arrangement between the
management committee and the plaintiff company recording fast-forwards
 planning the work referred to in this document cantonese translation
 recording fast-forwards 
 
yes 
can you please tell us the arrangement cantonese
translation recording fast-forwards cantonese answer 
 
actually it was charged per cleaning and subsequently a fixed
amount was charged monthly for all cleanings in the month 
now the problem concerning this particular drainage pipe
was is a problem that existed at the time you first became chairman 
recording fast-forwards that is that is why i want to confirm uhm i i i
might have misread the evidence but
 
well i i assume you try to get evidence to the contrary
the fact it was a separate rent for 
no no no i ' m i ' m trying to ask the arrangement
and then asked whether it is part of the same arrangement
 
 separate the two words 
 that 
 
 well this is same arrangement you just told us so
thank you ' thank you ' overlap ' haih ' - ' is it ' 
cantonese translation 
 
yes 
 
would 
i see
thank you 
now
 
just a moment please 
thank you recording fast-forwards 
the arrangement that you have just told us covering the two
documents at page thirty six and thirty eight
was it an arrangement that was already existing at the time you
negotiate the current management agreement with the plaintiff at page five to
eight of the plaintiff ' s bundle recording fast-forwards 
 a few words not recorded due to fast-forwarding my
question to this
 
yes 
and then i asked you this at the time it discussed about the
management contract at page five to eight was there any specific
reference to the prior arrangement concerning the drainage pipe at
page thirty six and thir thirty eight recording fast-forwards
 cantonese answer recording fast-forwards 
 
i believe that uhm no and uh because the cleaning of those pipes
belong to some sort of special repair charge 
after the signing of the management at page five to eight
 did you consider the arrangement of the two pipes still continue or
not
 
yes a long pause 
okay 
may i refer you mr loong uh to page eighty five cantonese

meeting or meetings agreed to pay that amount a long pause 
when was
 
 ro 
do you remember roughly when was the uh man when did
the management committee approve such a sum of money cantonese word

cantonese answer 
 
immediately before the election of the new committee i
believe 
 
what 
 
i believe a long pause

now can you tell us then when did the plaintiff ' s company
first suggested the sum of five thousand dollars for the approval of the
management committee
 
uh before the renovation it was uh suggested that if the
renovation was not carried out then a lump sum would be given to the
plaintiff ' s company as some sort of travelling expenses 
and at that time
 
 three words 
at that time when a lump sum figure was requested by the
plaintiff

did they
 
you don't know when that was done
at the moment uhm when it when it when it was suggested 
that the lump sum be given it ' s not two words was the
amount also fixed at that time recording fast-forwards 
 
somewhere between five and six thousand dollars 
 
 two words 
i see
 
well 
so there was not any fixed amount agreed at that stage was
that cantonese translation recording fast-forwards 
and subsequently after the plan of renovation was dropped
they submitted a suggestion of five thousand as the lump sum figure

yes well indeed we uh we have sent out uhm quite a number of
letters to all newly formed incorporated owners

companies we have no linkage with any developers

litigation of damages i ' ll lead 
 
 i ' m asking you the relevance of this evidence 
the relevance is to prevent any allegation from the defendant
on our purported lack of duty
 
there is no claim or damages or the claim was sums of money
liquidated themselves
did you say you are entitled to it because the company was
totally on a quantum maruit basis 
your honour particular four of paragraph ten refers to the
loss of benefit to the contract
 
uhm 
particular four to paragraph ten on the re-amended defendant
 bun uh re-amended particular
it ' s the claim for the loss of benefit of this contract due to
early termination

what are you going to show three words there ' s
no prayer for damages as i say
you deleted the prayer for damages 
yes
 
therefore if you want to complaint eight seven of liquidated
 one word you wanted to show a few words
 to the contract 
but that is an entitlement under the contract if it
is a fixed term contract
 
 wh where is it 
where is the contract provide with paper to the fixed sum and the
rental termination as well

you who d elete your prayer for damages you are claiming the liquidated
itself under the contract and quantum meruit
