good evening and welcome to newsline
""
my name is maureen boyd
""
tonight is nineteen ninety  draws  to a close we look back
upon the year
""
the main events in hong kong and their implications and
consequences
""
joining t l tsim and me tonight are doctor joseph cheng dean of the
school of arts and social sciences at the open learning institute and doctor
richard wong senior lecturer of economics at chinese university  welcome
gentlemen
""
well we saw some extraordinary events and developments in past year
""
let  ' s just  list a couple of them the pass of the basic law
decision on direct elections uh  draft  bill right the nationality
package the brain drain the civil servants unrest the port airport projects
""
it  ' s really been quite a year
""
now richard wong i know that you believe that all this would not
have happened without tiananmen square
""
can you uh expand on them 
""
""
i wouldn't put it exactly in that way
""
i think all of this happening in the same year year probably would
not have happened had it not been tiananmen square
""
a lot of the things have been in the pipeline
""
the airport has been  has been long discussion
""
the great basic law has take years to to get drafted
""
uh but tiananmen square sort of put all the things together and all
happen in the past year
""
uhm and i think uh one of the major things that impacted hong kong
very severe is the loss of confidence as a result of that event
""
uh and people began to think of ways to rebuild their confidence to
to continue to maintain hong kong as a kind of society
""
they hope it will continue now and beyond nineteen ninety seven for
a moment
""
people thought things was falling apart uh but i think the events
have shown there  ' s a lot of vitality that still remains in this community
 
""
joseph cheng 
""
""
i think what happened soon after tiananmen square was that 
uh all parties concern realized  that china needs uh good economic
relations with the west
""
and therefore economic ties between china and hong kong and between
china and the rest of the world very quickly recovered and that that was the
basis why confidence to a large extend recovered at least uh in the short
term
""
i think the fact that we have this right of abode package from the
uk and the the united states government is about to offer another package
will help to stabilize this exodus of talent from hong kong as well
""
and so we we have uh  a relatively calm year actually despite
this ten tension between uh  uh beijing and hong kong
""
uhm the element of distrust between the two places has certainly
been strengthened and because of the chinese leadership  ' s fear of peaceful
evolution it has look upon hong kong as a base of subversion and this
explains a lot of the uh  uhm difficulties in   this 
relationship
""
""
 yeah  
""
i i certainly agree with with that
""
i think we  ' re looking at the first post- tiananmen square year 
and we are still  uh adjusting to that   reality 
""
whereas before tiananmen a lot of people in the west and a lot of
people in hong kong were prepare  to uh give china the benefit of the
doubt
""
after tiananmen a lot my friends a lot of people i know were saying
 we we can't trust them anymore
""
and because of that the hong kong government had  has had to
come up with this pads the port and airport development project and rounded
up all the figures to a hundred and twenty seven billion
""
now that was seen at the time  re  remembering that this was
uh right after tiananmen as a confidence boosting exercise
""
had it not been for tiananmen we would not have done that or the
government would not have done that
""
and uh we  ' re now living with the consequence of that to an 
 extent 
""
so tiananmen was very very important
""
after that i don't think  a lot of people have faith in the
sino-british  declaration anymore
""
i certainly don't have faith in the basic law
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well in in one respect i think what tiananmen square has done
for hong kong is in the past there was some hope that we would structure the
future of our society around the basic law
""
people were spending a lot trying trying to perfect the basic law
to put things in the basic law as as the basic social contract that will pull
the society together
""
i think  what has happened since then is that  people are now
exploring and i think to some extend successful
""
uh is to  str  structure society around the social contract
that  really depend on economic relationships and also depend on the
threat of exit uh from hong kong with a lot of people getting foreign
passports having children send abroad uh bringing in economic partners from
  overseas 
""
so you  ' re seeing the a a a a form of internationalizing all the
assets human physical financial in hong kong that is is the basis for hoping
that uh hong kong can survive beyond nineteen   ninety  seven
""
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
previous to tiananmen it was a relationship  based on trust at
least on the on the surface
""
but after tiananmen it  ' s now become clear that this has to be a
relationship based on mutual distrust and and that is a significant  
change 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
that  ' s let  ' s turn to economic view just a second
""
i mean so far we  ' re talking about you know mostly political
events but  you know terms in economic you know you you hear the terms
slow down double digit inflation  one-word  economic
growth
""
they  ' re all terms used to describe uh  nineteen ninety 
which was more  one-word  economist 
""
""
well basically i think all economists uh believe that business
cycle come and go and we are in the middle uh of a slow down economy
""
uh it  ' s a miracle that we have had such a long boom post-war boom
longest in our history uh throughout the world as well as well as in hong
kong
""
uh we but we will be i think entering a third year next year of a
slow down economy which in a way is one of the uh very rare events in hong
kong
""
we  ' ve never seen three years of a slow down all in in one go uh
  but 
 
""
 how   much if it  ' s the uh business cycle
""
how much of it is related to political    development
 
""
""
 uh it  ' s   really difficult to separate out
""
because i think uh the economic recession would have come anyway
""
uhm the timing has a lot to do with first uh the slow down in china
with the oil crisis that has uh come about this year
""
uh but all is not an end it really depend very much on what happens
to uh   fed  policy in united states
""
if they decide to uh stimulate the economy then we  ' ll see an end
to the recession some time uh late next year if they start doing it now
""
""
i i think we can we can cope with pure economic crisis very
nicely
""
i mean we have been we have  been able to demonstrate that that
capacity in the past decades
""
uh what we see here is that while we  ' ve been troubled by uh  by
the future  ' s problem by various nineteen ninety seven issues
""
our economy has been  doing quite well although we have to admit
that our competitiveness has fallen behind taiwan and singapore now
""
uhm  i think what happen last year also taught hong kong people
that well a lot will actually depend on china
""
and unfortunately china is a big uh  uhm unknown and by almost
by definition when power is hardly concentrated in a small group of people
""
the regime tends to be unstable
""
and when that group of people happens to be very very old that
instability will will be much exacerbated
""
and in the coming year we we are bound to see uhm joking post for
position if not struggles for power within the leadership
""
in preparation for the uh retreat of the first generation of
leaders uh the economy is in  in difficulties that will also have a
significant impact on on hong kong
""
and you also have the situation when nobody have the solutions of
commonly accepted solutions to political and economic reforms
""
  so  this instability will going to have a very
severe impact on our  one-word  coming two   three
years 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah we we  
""
with now hong kong  uh  has become  part of the chinese
vortex and there is no escaping it
""
uhm downturn in china trade that affects our economy and upshot in
the number of people leaving that not only affects the uh the talent that  ' s
available in hong kong
""
it also affects strangely of course or logically in in in richard  ' s
case
""
uh wages when uh executive senior executive middle ranking
executive are leaving in large numbers
""
they have to be replaced and in order to replace them you  ' ve got
to offer better salaries
""
and that of course led to wage led inflation
""
so we had all these problems and uhm unless uhm  china  ' s own
political climate changes i think uh hong kong will be in for some pretty
difficult time ahead
 
""
what about law and order 
""
""
well you you can see that when when people  do not 
believe in the long term future
""
uh the temptation to  to be involved in crime is is all the more
greater
""
and and i think the major challenges is the uhm  the
disciplinary forces whether or not our disciplinary forces can maintain high
morale can recruit sufficient new members and can carry out the functions
effectively
""
i think this is the major worry in fact in various opinion polls
this is seen to be number one worry on the part of hong kong people
""
admittedly these also represent certain long term trends which may
have nothing to do with nineteen ninety seven
""
the fact that uh it is a bit  that  juvenile  delinquency
will be on the rise because we are in a more affluent society and and family
stability is more difficult to be to be   maintained so on 
 
""
 can i i want talk   about the civil servant and
disciplinary forces just and now a little bit
""
just to go back to law and order have the events of this year you
know uh  in triad related event  some  violence
""
has it been  particularly upsetting to you
""
you you see this as a an increasing trend or or how do you feel
about it 
""
""
people see this largely as a worrying trend rather than uh 
than uh worry over the present situation
""
after all we have to admit that hong kong is still very safe city
""
i mean we can still go about most parts of the the territory 
 at night so 
""
""
 except no   other city losses as many cars as
hong kong people
""
""
because there  ' s a market ready those cars
""
""
but in that respect i think in terms of law and order both
are they related to economic crimes or uh fraud and as well as other uh
criminal elements
""
i think we are also  having a new dimension and that is because
of the closer interaction between hong kong and china
""
we  ' ll be seeing a variety of new anomalies that would appear
""
""
what what worries me is is that  police recruitment is
down again
""
you remember when they raised wages for joining policemen uh 
the first reaction was uh there were quite a lot of applicants
""
the the last report i  ' ve read and this was just uh two weeks ago
is that  figures are coming down again
""
we are not getting enough new policemen to join the forces and
there are still large numbers leaving    and  as a result of
that they had to recruit more female police officers for instance
""
and asking those who have retired to come back on contract terms
""
i mean these are stop gap measures they might be uh  useful for
a while but in the long term we  ' ve got to be able to solve that problem
""
and i can't see any solution frankly
""
""
 and  
""
""
well having  well trying to to have the cadet school again
""
i think will help to to some extent
""
but uh this is not the only and perfect solution
""
uhm further to what t l has said i have heard uhm a lot of uh
police policemen rank  and file  policemen who who are not  who
have no plan of emigration
""
but nonetheless they are still talking about uh early retirement
in their  in in a few years time
""
i mean they prefer to leave the force pick up the pension stay in
the quarters or in the public housing unit and then pick up another job
""
they they feel it  ' s more attractive and safer route
 
""
okay let  ' s uh  take a stop here and come back after the break
with a small discussion of nineteen ninety  music and commercial break
""
""
welcome back to our review of nineteen ninety
""
and richard wong wanted uh development that was talked about 
awful  was a shortage of labour
""
uh given your views on importing foreign labour and what  ' ll
happen this year 
""
""
well basically i think ever since uh the touch base policy
was ended
""
hong kong has  have  a  uh uh shortage of labour has
been exacerbated over time and with the aging of the population i think there
was very little scope
""
but to import labour uhm with emigration at the  skill end uh i
see that in the future they will not only importing  a labour in the sense
of of having a programme to bring in non- skill workers
""
but we will actually be  be getting in more and more people
skill and  unskill  from around the world
""
and i think it will happen uhm  because as otherwise economy
will not be able to grow at the rate that we hope
""
it uh it will continue  at least before you know beyond
nineteen ninety seven
""
so i see uh it will be  uh an issue of quite a bit of tension
within the   community 
""
""
 but   do do we really need them do you think
""
uh i can see a need for uhm  replacing  the executives who
have left hong kong that i can see
""
but uhm replacing  skilled and semi-skill workers is there a
need for that
""
bearing in mind that   a lot  of the jobs have gone into
the special economic zones in guangdong provinces
""
""
 yeah  
""
yes well there  ' s a limit to how many  types of jobs that you
can move to china
""
uh  throughout the whole whole  region in from korea taiwan
singapore  and even in in thailand malaysia when you grow very rapidly you
will always need labour
""
  uh  throughout the whole area there is enormous
clamour everywhere i go to for shortage of labour skilled as well as
unskilled
""
and so i think basically which community is best able to overcome
the political obstacles will have one of the major edges in terms of
competitive advantage around the uh world
 
""
 yes  
""
joseph cheng we  ' re talking early about the civil service unrest
""
has the degree of unrest surprise to this year and uh  and if
you can talk a little bit about the nationality package and whether that  ' s
going to  one-word  any of the  problems 
""
""
i think lu ping has finally responded in in saying that well
the top civil servants they can still get their passports and be  and be
and have their hearts at ease in serving hong kong
""
and even when nineteen ninety seven comes they can  give up the
passports and and be promoted to to the secretaries grade
""
uh and at the same time he has expressed concern over the pension
fund
""
i think this reflected on one hand the awareness on the part of
chinese authorities that this is a very serious problem that the chinese side
must do something to rebuild the confidence of the civil servants
""
otherwise uh the stability of hong kong in the traditional period
and beyond will be will be in jeopardy
""
on the other hand i i sincerely hope that beijing and london will
come to an agreement very soon
""
on the cultivation maintenance and so on of the civil servants
otherwise i  ' m afraid that they  that they will become a kind of target of
united  fund  work on both sides
""
and they will lose their neutrality and this is very dangerous
""
because there are certain  united  fund  strategy
elements on the part of lu ping  ' s remarks
""
my understanding is that the chinese  uhm new china 
one-word  news agency had had been talking to the top civil
servants and this is an appropriate response
