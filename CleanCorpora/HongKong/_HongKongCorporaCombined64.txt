so tut it maybe uh a a difficult  $a-laughs di difficult task to to looking for job to look for jobs  this time is yeah yeah   uh   uhm   uhm   yes uhm uhm  kazuko uhm have you got any jobs before coming to hong kong university   any jobs  yes   i haven't worked for long time  $b-laughs  for maybe seven eighteen years i don't have any job now   oh   eighteen years   uh uh i ' m very envy of you you are very lucky woman  $b-laughs    i don't think so  but i travel a lot so i just didn't  i didn't really have a chance to uh how can i say since i marry i ' ve travelled to many countries to finding a job we have that to settle down first  but some of the places uh i visited oh just uh visited i live there for two years  and i just didn't have a chance to find a job   okay two-words   oh i see i see   yeah   uhm   uhm yeah yeah yeah   uhm   uhm   uhm   i see   oh  i ' m very worry about my future career   and  laugh  because i think uhm tut  i ' m not uhm very competitive and not uhm very brilliant i think it ' s not very have a very good chance for me to enter an ideal firm and to continue my future ca career yes you are too humble  $z-laughs  not humble it ' s just the fact  $z-laughs  and kazuko uhm you have studied here uh for two years of uh nearly two years  uhm then uhm do you find that your univer university life is uhm satisfactory or below your expectation    nearly two years yes  it ' s above my expectation  really   uhm  what do you expect do you find the uh students here are nice and very helpful or you find or you like the uh studies here   yes i find them uhm student are very uhm hard-working  $a-laughs   uhm  hard working not us     yeah  yeah yeah yeah   and  laugh  excluding me  $a-and-$b-laugh    and uhm ambitious too  and they are very helpful too  yes   uhm   uhm   oh yeah  uhm why do you choose english as the your minor subject  minor     uhm  uh major is uhm is major major   major sub   uh yes yes   other subjects    uh i always interested in eng studying english and also i because my husband is british i continuously make a communication with uh in english   uhm   uhm  it ' s very interesting  $a-laughs    and and just being japanese i have a very limited choice to choose which subject because i can't really choose uh japanese  one-word anything so i i i am interested in english literature too   uhm   uhm   uh  uhm uhm but i ' ve found it ' s boring  $a-laughs  especially the novel two   really   maybe you take novel two too  yeah   one-word   yes    i found it ' s very interesting   yeah   oh   maybe i don't like uh reading  reading a lot  because uhm in the third year novel two i found that uhm many uhm lecture uhm are talking about the theory   rather than the plot and the character i think the character is more interesting rather than the theory for example uhm what is the freud theory uhm yester yesterday talking about  $a-laughs     oh that ' s right   yeah  but i think uh uhm not talking about the character    it ' s so interesting but the one way you can sort of  uhm study by yourself   uhm   uhm  yeah yeah uhm   but theories  i don't think you can do that yes  i think you you have a deeper understanding by know studying theory  if you have a deeper understanding of that novel  knowing one-word theory i think that will help you to yes   uhm   too too complicated   yes   uhm   uhm   yes  so we we have to   coughs to do a lot of work before we  $a-laughs understand these theories  yeah  yes  $a-laughs   that ' s very hard for me  uh  yeah yeah   what kind of work do you mean  i i mean you have to finish reading the novel  $a-laughs  you have to uhm you you have the plot and also you have to think through it about the character and the plot how they are related to each other in order to have a more uh thorough understanding of what the lecturer is going to talk about the theories  if if we we don't do that how can we uh  how can we get the uh point by uh putting forward by the by the lecturers  yes that ' s the first step   if if    i think uh  no but the what i do is normally i attend the lecture first  of course i finish the novel reading novel    and then uh i attend the lecture first and then i uh i lecturer they stimulate uh my mind  $a-laughs  and then i go back again i don't know many thing before that too much    maybe i think about the plot and the character   and uh maybe theme but that ' s all but theories how we apply i would think about it after attending the lecture  yes   uhm   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm   uh ha   uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm yes   uhm uhm   after and after   yeah   uhm  maybe uh uh students uh  $a-laughs difficult yes i agree i don't like literature but uh instead uhm i like linguistic i think it ' s more useful and uhm can i can grasp it better uhm do you agree jennifer  $a-laughs  i i really depends on uh  $a-laughs on different people  some may find linguistics too boring to  uh  i mean some tut  it ' s just the things here you have to resign them  but for literature you have to use a lot of imagination  a lot of thinking  so different people may find may find    they are challenging as well two-words    yeah   uhm   uhm     yeah   yeah   uhm   uhm   uhm   but maybe i haven't studied uhm english literature before so sometimes i use too uhm tut  not beautiful words to express my ideals  $z-laughs  uhm uh absolutely i agree with you because i i didn't take uh literature in uh secondary school  so it it would take times when you to uhm to think in that kind of way  yeah those people who do literature do  uhm   uhm   yes   yes  $a-laughs    yes yes  kazuko do you uhm did you uhm study english literature before   no right in elevens or or level because japanese education system is quite different    because we have to study everything all the kind everything   uhm   uhm   uhm   everything  oh   all the kind but the not very deep  so i didn't have to write any essay so  yeah general edu  it ' s it ' s a uh it ' s i don't have to write essay or for this is really first time for me  to study literature these degree   uh i see   it ' s general education   uhm   uhm  could you enjoy it   yes  $a-laughs  yeah yes the tape stops for one minute   so what will oh that ' s separate isn't it  yeah yeah yeah     i find the english literature is very interesting and uhm much more interesting than the linguistics    i i don't know whether linguistics is gonna to be useful or not i think uh  it ' s al it ' s gonna be useful but english literature is gonna be very useful in a different way   uhm   uhm  yeah yeah yeah    yes   uhm  i think we can learn much more from uh new words and vocabulary and also the uh writing style   yes  mother than several words     yeah two-words we can yeah that ' s right  yeah uhm some my friends uhm they took uhm one-word did last year and they said their result were also tragedy all speakers laugh    modern tragedy   oh oh i  yes   what what you mean modern tragedy   find it    yes i feel that is gonna to be my tragedy  no i don't think so i i think you can manage it    no   i think it ' s uh  it ' s very different from just running english novel because   you concentrated on uh certain aspect   do we   no   uhm   uhm   uh ha    or theme of the uh story  and then you you have to go in to much deeper   about uh how can i say idea of death or idea or uh uh life  and  $a-laughs   uhm   uhm  quite philosophical   yes  $a-laughs  so i ' m i ' m discourage by my friend they say that literature also produces tragedy result  $z-laughs  for example shakespeare they also say that they also say that uhm it is very hard to study    they one-word   yes shakespeare work is much more  difficult     yeah  i did  i did year one   you did   oh  do you find it ' s very hard   yes you have to be very fimiliar with everything of the passage  which i ' m not i have to study  $a-laughs  and uhm i find that very harsh   uhm uhm  uhm yeah     yes  but it it is very interesting  interesting   yes and i much rather uh study something inte  you know interest me  rather than uh aiming for good result do you know what i mean  $a-and-$b-laugh   uhm   yes yes  you enjoy the process of uh learning   and studying     yes   even if my result  $a-laughs is not so good  but i like i i prefer subject uh what  they can uh prefer uh favourite subject rather than the   is not so satisfactory   uhm uhm   two-words   uhm  than the marks   yeah that ' s right   yes   yeah  but sometimes we have to be face reality   two-words   because you know our future is  determined by the marks  yes yes     yes   yes uh   yes this is one-word job and some my lecturer say that uhm even uhm second class uhm no second class    uh yes  second class uhm that ' s that ' s up second up and the second low  no the the honour and even second low is not good is not good enough so you should try your best to to  second up class honour and that ' s very terrible for me i ' m afraid i will fail  $a-and-$z-laugh   uh uh the honour the honour   to get a second   oh  yeah yeah uh yes   what what are you major major   uh english but i take uh   english literature  linguistics   linguistics  yeah   uh yes   uhm  but you know uh uh we this year that means uh   we english students yeah  it is not state in the uh testimonial or the  the that kind of uh sort  paper whether you are major or you are majoring in some subjects or minor   oh yes   the largest students yes   uhm   passengers   uhm    it ' s different system isn't it   yeah yeah yeah   a different system for the   yes we like this system  and just take what we like yeah yeah yeah  $a-laughs    oh i see yeah   but still i can write i ' m majoring in english because i take uh many courses in english linguistics especially    in english yes  right  and other course history history do you find it is more interesting or difficult than  english studies uh i i think i enjoy study english more than history why uh because i it ' s a different kind of learning in   university  when you study english uhm but in the secondary school  we only uh study uhm grammar or the passage very uhm tut  i don't know how to say but it ' s a di different kind of uh studies  uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   gram  uhm   i think secondary school maybe you with uh  method of studying its this spirit isn't it  i mean in university really after you  you have organize by yourself  how to look at your assignment  what kind of material you like to read   yeah yeah yeah yeah   uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm   uhm  yeah yeah yeah  and more more deeper something that you you you didn't encounter in a secondary school but when you come to university you have the chance to    yes  yeah you can concentrate and you can focus on that  yeah yeah yeah  uhm kazoko uhm besides english uhm what subjects uhm you have take  yes i have that    uh in this year  second year i ' m taking comparative literature   do you have yes  oh oh   comparative literature     yeah i ' m taking a course feminine  something  $a-laughs   sociology     two-words and the cultural myth  sociology and what    feminine role and the cultural myth   com   comp lit  oh com lit   i see     comparative literature  yes   oh  is it very hard   it is very interesting  it ' s quite a different way of looking at literature  uh of course you have to compare i mean you study  i study about six books   interesting   uhm  oh six   six    it ' s all related to a issue  women issue   uh si  uh uhm  and the context of culture  myth culture uh for instance like uh how society treats women or  how these uhm uh authors female author suffer from the prejudice   uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   you know maybe hundred few years ago uh it is very hard for the female authors to to publish their own books   yes   yeah   uhm    so it is very interesting it ' s more involved uh more uhm sociology  uhm uhm   sociological aspect and uh philosophical aspect then   oh because some my friends say that uhm comparative literature is very interesting but they don't know how to study it it before because uhm there are no reference book what uhm you write is just your imagination what do you feel about uhm the film or just the just the novel and you have fun got some very practical and realistic  $a-laughs  uh reference books for you to study or to take uh as a reference do you find it as your obstacle for your study   i i find that uh i have lost uh  at the beginning  because i haven't taken any introductory course in the  first year and this uhm feminine roles and the cultural myth  is course for second year student and also  the third year student  and fin uhm yes i wasn't very sure what they are actually looking at and i didn't know how to approach  especially when uhm lecture lecturer introduce theory freud freud uh  theory of freud  and also uh feminist fem uh  feminist theory uhm i couldn't really  uhm how can i say apply these theories to the   stories which around  but uhm i think you can use the theories  but if you don't want that  you don't have to it ' s really after you everyone has different ideals to approach   as long as you have a main  $a-laughs uhm theme correctly i think it ' s really after you   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   freud   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uh  uhm this really sound not not so not so difficult   it is the it is not easy though all speakers laugh  yeah   many reading materials they have to read books   uhm   uhm   always like that in literature you have to read a lot    yes  yes many books and you have studied uhm english novel two and compar lit  there ' s about ten books   and $b-laughs    more than that  oh sorry yeah   because comparative literature uh cover first of all little women uhm   yes  and then the age of innocence  and then uhm  yeah very thick are these book  that ' s very thick book and now jane eyre   uhm little woman   oh   oh   great book   uhm   jane eyre  uhm    yes and then uh i have to cover other two or three books   and some my classmates say that uhm they have studied a class of comparative literature department and it has a book about nine hundred pages over nine hundred pages of a book and they say that ' s terrible  $a-laughs   uhm     yes  yeah yeah yeah   it ' s very different way of approaching uhm from uh english literature  because english literature you actually going to the theme and you actually uh involved in uh uh plot and the theme and characters in the book  but the comparative literature you you get idea from you know sociological idea you know philosophical idea and you compare with this book with another book you have learnt and so it ' s it ' s more wide but that in the way you don't go into so much deep depth of a novel  itself   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm  i see uhm uh you are a housewife and your son ' s mother  and then do you find enough time to study on the one hand and to look after  $z-laughs your family on the other hand  $b-laughs     yes  i don't look after my family so where i two-words   $b-laughs  it ' s it ' s mercy you have maid     i ' m a only pro uh only a part-time  wife all speakers laugh and mother   and a full-time student all speakers laugh   uhm  full-time student  $a-laughs    i have to spend uh most of my time for studying  otherwise i just don't have uh i don't still have enough time  but the i try to spend at least two hours with my family  everyday   uhm   uhm   where two us   two us and yet  you know in company  and twenty four hours a day  uh  $b-laughs  you just spend one of twelve hour ev ev a day to share with your family  $b-laughs    no i insisted uhm  no after the dinner i ' m try to uhm uh stay with my husband two hours  $b-laughs  that ' s very hard actually  because uh if i have to write essay i want to write essay  but uhm  time allocation is very difficult   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yes   uh  yes all speakers laugh  uhm do your sons or daughters uhm they speak japanese or say english or something other language else   yeah i ' ve got one daughter for he ' s six uh for he ' s gonna be sixteen years year year year old this may  she speaks at four languages   uhm   oh   uhm   four languages   four    yes  your daughter   yes he uhm  which four languages japanese   uh since she was born i started speaking to her in japanese all the time  $b-laughs  so her japanese was quite good and then as you know  he ' s talking a private lesson from japanese lady  learning writing and reading so but the her main language is uh mother tongue is japanese because i  taught her  but her main language is english and then because she goes to german youth school international  school  she has learnt german for ten years  so she ' s quite uh good in german and also she very she likes french   uh ha   uhm   uhm   mother tongue   uhm   uhm   uh ha   oh  french   yes she ' s  $a-laughs very good at french   uh   she ' s very good at language and learning yeah yeah yeah     because she study very early   that ' s that ' s fine as since she was born she was listening two languages at same time so somehow uhm she can accept many different  languages  yes   uhm   yeah yeah   uhm   uhm   languages  and then do your husband and learn japanese   he speaks little bit of japanese isn't he yeah  $b-laughs  it ' s very strange have have a international family   yeah  $b-laughs  but it ' s it ' s very good to to  yeah to be able to speak and did uh mandarin  $a-laughs   yes     he now learning uh mandarin  mandarin   he speaks little little cantonese too  uh do you know mandarin   no i don't all speakers laugh  neither do i i i don't know mandarin  $z-laughs do you uh a little bit  $a-laughs    yeah  uh but it ' s very useful  yeah especially there ' re nineteen ninety seven   it comes one- word   i think   yes    are you intending to learn mandarin in future  yes i i think so  because uhm tut  it will be uhm much more use useful than uh before and you will find maybe you you will find a lot of chances of using it  but sometimes i find it uh difficult to learn in the uh language centre maybe because after uh the lesson you have no more chances to speak it but sometimes maybe if if you go to a provinces or a place in china which speak mandarin you you will find it more much more faster to to learn a language  other than just uh uh sitting in the lesson as in the language centre  uhm   uhm     yes   yes  yes  uhm how many years have you been in hong kong   i lived here for ten years  nearly ten years   ten years  oh you have got many new friends in hong kong   yes i have uhm  i have uhm how i can i made uhm uhm friends but problem is uh they all left  most of them have already left   uhm   uhm  left   yes  left for   left hong kong  oh i see   uhm     that is problem in hong   laughs kong i think  yes   i ' ve met many people and maybe two of third of them already gone   uh ha     yes  have you change your uhm the style of a life for example in jap in japan uhm you do sushi   coughs    you eat sushi   yes  and then in hong kong then have you uhm changed your cooking style uh for example uhm western or chinese food    yeah  yes but i uh uhm  i don't really change the cooking style all speakers laugh   maybe sometimes you do do like japanese cooking and sometimes you do western kind one- word am i right     yes that ' s uh sometimes are chinese  yeah   yeah   yeah yeah yeah    yes  yeah just natural yes very wonderful  $b-and-$z-laugh   because uhm your husband is a british   and you ' re japanese i think uhm which food style that you will have  $a-laughs  uh for western or for japanese or for something else    yes   uhm  i think it ' s mixed   uhm   mixed     yeah yeah but uh my daughter like japanese style   uhm   like japanese style     yeah she like rice she she has to eat rice everyday  $a-laughs  everyday how how how many bowls    yeah  bowls all speakers laugh  no once everyday  oh   yeah  that ' s not too much   no  $b-laughs  i think teenagers like hamburger and potato chips it ' s the fast food yes some may likes i i don't quite like fast food  i prefer tut eating uh uh chinese food  oh  so you ' re very healthy and fit  $a-laughs  not not fit but all speakers laugh  i prefer healthy diet  i don't like eating those soft drink and uh    yes  i don't really like uh fast food neither but my daughter she doesn't eat a lot but the when uh very often but she went never she goes to see the films  with uh with a friends   they i think she goes to mcdonald ' s or kentucky fired chicken   uhm   uhm
