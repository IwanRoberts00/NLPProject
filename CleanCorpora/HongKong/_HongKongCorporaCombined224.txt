good afternoon ladies and gentlemen first i would like to start my speech by pointing out the three points we have talked about that the twenty-four hour cross uh open it having open access twenty-four hour uh cross-border it would encourage the uh the draining of our access it would encourage uh crime and it would be most importantly a symbol that hong kong has lost control  what do i say about mobility look at the property as that we now have in hong kong the five star uhm residential the hotel-class so the residential that you can have if you have the status and all these they liv people are moving one word  people are moving to china to live they ' re having their livelihoods there their businesses there  their their shops there and pe children are going to school there these acts they lure they basically lure us to live in china but however is that something that we should encourage what is happening here that our our brains are basically being drained away  look at hong kong that hong kong ' s economy on the other hand we have recession our our upturn of the economy is still slow we have this impending world trade organization issue and our opponents have repeatedly said that hong kong uh that china ' s entry into wto would be a boom to us all it would be an asset however they had been too native they have never considered the fact that shanghai that there ' re that places like shanghai that there are many other places in china that poses real competition for hong kong that there are technicians there that there are university students there who who have  uhm gained a foothold in in in the techno techno  technological sector and that hong kong in its present state just is not up to the competition and if we do have this twenty-four hour cross uh opening on the cross-border what would that be a symbol that we are not keeping our people in and that we are encouraging them out  besides hong kong china already has an international arbitration center what makes you think that they are going to uh usualize  hong kong ' s uh legal ' s uh legal services or the economic services do you think that they are really lagging that behind us  we have to stand out and our ground take reali  reality in our hands and hel bring out the incentive to keep our people in and not to keep them out while we ' re telling people that we are kicking our doors wide open that because of this more convenience uhm beca uh this the some these are some of the good points the opponents had been talking about but they have not been looking at the long-term consequences of this twenty-four hour cross border open access and although it is already happening it is no justification  to bring out this m more than a policy change however why twenty-four hours they ' ve also not talked about it it is although it is already happening do you think that  techni technicians and professionals actually work twenty-hour hours it is the whole symbolism of its all uh of of these all the hong kong is losing its ground next of all i talked about crime look at the drug abuse in the discos and the nightclubs over the border we are we has we have two words s  smuggling in hong kong cars and fake goods all over the border we have uh a serious prostitution problem from over the border pirated cds which sell like hot cakes uh over in the shenzhen commercial center what do these tell us what are we telling the public if we have open assess that we are opening doors to them that it is uh that despite we take the pride of upholding the security of the border that we are actually bleaching it that despite we ' re upholding values of intellectual property that we are crack we are making crack down on the illegal and infringing goods s we are actually letting our people having more more and everything as they like at anytime of the day besides tha what have i been saying the hong kong this that having this open access is not about a matter of businessmen having twenty- four hours to go over the border or technicians having twenty-four hours to come over this side it is it ' s symbolism of that hong kong has no longer any true control over it over the flow of its uh of people across its border look at this after nineteen ninety seven hong kong has resumed sovereignty under china we should be under a system of one country two systems however our opponents j just focus on the one country bit however if we don't look at the two systems bit what sense does it make of this one country two systems uh policy think of it uhm they ha although they had quoted the basic law to us saying that hong kong is an alienal an alienable part of china have they looked to the preamble of the basic law and the sino-joint declaration which says that hong kong should maintain its independence and autonomy however what do we have now hong kong has has shown this image to the uh to to foreigners  that we had been losing our autonomy and independence because of increasing intervention by china uh whether it ' s by legally that they have intervened by interpreting our basic law and such what one people are so sensitive about the very real threat of chinese intervention into hong kong affairs in whatever matter are we going to risk this very negative implication of open access there is there may be a demand but there ' s no such a need there ' s no wide-spread justification for this twenty-four hour  and i can tell you that they have not wait the implications between  and so therefore this motion must stand thank you  madame speaker honorable adjudicators members of this house good afternoon the common ground of today ' s debate is that we both believe the hksar should formulate its policies to serve her citizens to the fullest and we also believe that we still have a border running through hong kong and shenzhen but what we disagree on is whether the twenty-four  border-crossing will se satisfy the general citizens ' needs to the greatest we on the negative side believe that it will based on the philosophical economic and feasibility aspects and which will be further  e re reiterated by me at the end of my speech but right now let ' s just go deeply into what the fatal fallacies that the other side has made today the other side has based their whole line of argument on a lot of assumptions assumption number one they said that this policy is only for the personal convenience and not for and not for the betterment of the whole society but we say it ' s not true because we believe that it ' s beneficial to both con for personal convenience as well as the whole economy they quoted to us the property market and then we say that they have mistakenly put an equal sign between the quality of the housing in hong kong as well as in china we we say that definitely not true because hong kong has definitely a better quality in terms of infrastructure standard of living  and we definitely had a better me medical care and all these are some crucial concerns when people choose where to live and then they simply assume that more people will go up there well let ' s look at from let ' s look at the issue from another angle if really if really people want to move up somewhere in china to live in then would this policy will provide them more choices  because right now in hong kong the rental cost and the investment cost is too high and we say it ' s not reasonable and then would this policy on one hand we can benefit businessmen and in turn it will boost our economy and on the other hand we can help the grass-root people  to get housing and realize their dreams now we say that the affirmative side definitely do not know what  pe hong kong people really need they definitely do not know how to formulate public policy  to enhance communication and economic prosperity and we say that the twenty-four hour cross-border is necessary and it ' s a genuine need now the second assumption they they suggested that well that twenty-four hour crossing it will in increase the intellectual property infringement and crime rate but we on this side of the house believe that it ' s it ' s not true because intellectual property infringement and crime rate simply are not caused by the operating hours  of the borders the extension of working hours simply do not exacer  exacerbate the problems there simply is no re correlation between these two things and then assumption number three that they have made they assume that this policy this practice in is infeasible and is cost in ineffective but we say that this is not true as already defeat this point is already defeated by our speakers since we provided you that the alternatives say the smartcard it will not increase the manpower it will not waste our resources because we ' ve also quoted the some uhm successful examples from other countries  the assumption number four that they have made they presume that the china ' s accession to the wto is detrimental to hong kong but we say that ' s not true because we can create a win-win situation in both hong kong and china because hong kong can provide the hi-tech hi-tech hi-tech to uhm expertise and knowledge to china and we hong kong have already established a long history in terms of these areas  and then while china can provide the hong kong businessmen lower cost of production we simply can gain from both sides and then we say that economic ties will become closer and this is precisely explained in our economic point the assumption number five that they have made they said that this policy simply cannot fulfill the one country two system premises but we say that this system can enhance the philosophy of having a unifying country and on the other hand the two systems can also be uh maintained because the ci citizens still have to cross the borders they still have to have to uh custom check and we still have a different legal system now our side ' s arguments are so self-evident and concrete while their uh side their side ' s arguments are so several words they ' ve been exagger exaggerating things if not fabricating it now what our side has told you today is that this policy is good to hong kong based on the philosocal philosophical and economic as well as the feasibility points of views and these are all beautifully presented to you by my speakers  my captain my second speaker and third speaker we say that this policy is good and we are proud to stand against it let ' s i hope you see the same light thank you  if only guests adjudicators my friendly opponents if only we have so many resources if only we have so much manpower if only the relationship between hong kong and china is so ideal then we don't even need to bother the future but we know that having today ' s motion that twenty-four hour border crossing with shenzhen will do more harm than good for hong kong it ' s involves a balancing act they will know there are complications in policy considerations and we cannot be so naïve as to think that being having more convenience we can have more benefits so let ' s go ahead and do it and forget about the cost well we stress today that the motion stresses on to hong kong the three words is crucial in the crust of today ' s debate therefore an analyzing whether we should open the borders  for the whole day we should see whether how it impacts hong kong and we say that of course we sympathies with you our negative side because we want everybody to be hand in hand of course china and hong kong we ' re one family why don't we cooperate but we say that the one country two systems is inherent  in the uhm policy of hong kong and that ' s the whole purpose of the basic law it ' s to maintain the economic competitiveness of hong kong so that it can continue to prosper in the future and down my line of speakers they have already shown you how there can be harms how can there can be risks arising from having an open border for the whole day and we say that going through the border is not like an octopus card we don't just go beep and then we can pass into shenzhen and come back whatever time we want there are other considerations and sometimes inconvenience justifies it so how have we been weighing this motion so far the negative have not for one time told us why it should be twenty-four hours not twenty-three hours not even not opening the border but total complete open border to the mainland and what magnitude of benefit it will arise for hong kong
