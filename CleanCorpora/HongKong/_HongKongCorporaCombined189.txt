welcome atv viewers to trackside this wednesday evening we are at sha tin and it ' s a bit blustery too but let ' s go straight into the live action with race two  well for the second event the sicuan handicap and three point seven for jamieson  forty nine dollars for number nine universal glory though as the last couple are to move up  legend ' s glory has dropped a point and now an extra half point in the next few seconds seven point six his dividend  that ' s number eight legend ' s glory so he ' s supported for shane dye  super elite i noticed dropped five points on the board as well and he ' s now down to thirty to one  kristofferson comes in  they ' re all in  we ' re set to go  oh this horse has got his head underneath magic of money  and came back in stall number five he put his head down and got halfway under well halfway his neck anyway  and at that point they ' re normally gone but he was smart enough to think no i ' m going to get trapped here i better come back  you don't see that one very often  keep an eye on stall eight as well heart ' s desire he got a bit restless last time he raced so  he ' s going to be uh a bit bored with this all going on  well they ' ll have to back him out which they ' re doing  magic of money number seven he dropped also at a very big price at the big board he was four hundred and twenty dollars a little while ago he ' s now three hundred and thirty  so they ' ll trot him around and check that he ' s okay but that we ' ll have a look at later but that was a bit of a freak one because his head went down just as they were getting ready to jump  and he took a big dive under the gates and he got his neck half way under  and then he thought no this is not the way i ' m meant to do it so he brought it back  now the front of the gate everything seems to be uhm okay although they are having a good look at it aren't they  although they ' re probably watching the horse come back through the stalls  let ' s have a look at this one again the green flag is up he ' s okay magic of money so he ' s been passed okay to run  on the big board sixty seven luck and fortune continues to trick it out fifty two bravo victory  three point nine jamieson  seven point three number eight legend ' s glory down even further so he ' s well bet and universal glory is forty five dollars  so they ' ve both been very well bet  now what ' s happening here  you know what  this barrier stall when i was talking about it it looked as though it was bent a little bit  maybe they ' re not able to use that barrier stall  and these horses as you can see are being backed out of the barriers but the ones drawn the inside  are remaining at this point locked up  now as you can assume i ' m simply guessing it at the moment because we ' re not in contact with the starters  but it does seem that all of those horses from that barrier stall of five are coming out and it is and  i wouldn't be surprised if they are all moving out one slot  because the horses in stalls one to four are remaining put  so magic of money an offender  if you are just turning on the screens and wondering what ' s going on sitting at home with your dinner or a cup of coffee or whatever  magic of money put in a bit of a freak one and he put his nose down underneath the stalls  and uh he ' s caused this problem one would suggest  thirty nine dollars is jamieson number five he ' s the favourite  we ' ll run down the big board for you  kristofferson fifty one on the big board bon bon at twelve  luck and fortune out to six point nine bravo victory at five point four trickling out  jamieson steady at three point nine and favourite  one hundred plus hearts desire  now here we go here ' s this replay see  in fact he gets himself that far under that he ' s stuck  he gets caught by the top of his whither of his pommel  and he couldn't go any further  hope you weren't blinking ha ha because it all happened fairly quickly  but as you can see magic of money in those lime colours is now locked back up and he ' s in stall number six  so barrier number five is not working due to the efforts of magic of money as we just saw a second ago  and these horses are being loaded up from the outside gates and uh yeah you can see when the attendants out there there ' s a pretty big bend in those stalls isn't there at the front  so this one hearts desire who was a bit timid about it last time comes in  universal glory stands up pretty well  glasgow kiss is in star of wah yan ' s loaded away  kristofferson comes forward  as we were saying the nine horse universal glory is four point seven the eight horse legend ' s glory seven point five  with only a couple to move in number ten at seven eleven he ' s at thirty four to one number twelve at seventy four to one the thirteen ' s at nine to one and fourteen ' s close enough to fifty to one that it doesn't matter  you ' re only missing a point of that  crowd jeering a bit as the last one comes up again  all set and they ' re racing  jamieson dwelt at the start immediately eased out at the go from the uh wider gate legend ' s glory otherwise new century ' s running hard  magic of money had begun well but speedy champion leads magic of money  bravo victory kicks up right up behind the speed  and luck and fortune ' s going to settle in forward of midfield  bon bon close with jamieson

heat  speedy champion ' s run third and a length off the winner was luck and fortune  new century has battled on too badly considering he was three wide all of the way and is about two lengths off the
