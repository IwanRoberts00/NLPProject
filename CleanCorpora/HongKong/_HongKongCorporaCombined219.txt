they have not changed much there are some new items but basically they are academic excellence  before that i am not sure why it does not show up on the screen but in my own notes the first item is the employer ' s perception of the university it is very surprising several words when i ran around these for employers and ask them whom do you recruit from some of them the last one whom i visited said we only recruit from six universities around the world we only look at six some tell us they only look at two which for some employers their perception of the university is very important and their perception is not always correct but certainly their perception of the university the second criterion which they s shortlist candidates  is academic excellence what does that include  now and then excellence for some employers includes this  your examination results in english chinese and mathematics and the hong kong school and the hong kong certificate of education exam and the hong kong a-level exam the public examination result at hkce and hkal the next one is gpa at the university the surprising thing is gpa is not as important to them as examination as public examinations because the gpa it is offered by individual university and it ' s not there ' s no objective benchmark object whereas your school certificate and a-level or equivalent public exams there is an ob objective benchmark  and the next thing to look at is well-rounded achievement this means uh this the applicants ' achievement in the students ' societies in community service and their hobbies  but not just studying alone the third criterion we look at is clear career goal do you know what you want to do with your life do you know what you want to be in five years time or ten years time how much do you know about the industry the occupation and the organization you do not have to be an expert but you have to be as knowledgeable as an informed and interested layman  a and you have to know about the market you have the market knowledge and not the sense the next one to look at is your key it ' s the applicants '  key skills of core competency the transferable skills  these include communicate communication is different from language skills you might speak perfect english perfect putonghua perfect cantonese  but then high level of vocabulary and yet you are not communicative so that is a distinction between them the next one is problem-solving working with others and improving old learning and performance this is very important if your record shows that you are a person who ' s very conscientious who had a lot of achievements because you do what you were told you are very obedient very hard-working do as you are told that is not good enough you have to be a self-starter who had who who has who who has a structure and a process to know how to keep on improving your old learning and performance  and the next log of things to look at is personal attributes these include whether you are interesting  just being hard-working and have good examination result is not good enough you have to be interesting you have to be creative doesn't necessarily mean that you have to wear out uh very fashionable trendy things and wear ear- rings several words  but you have to be able to create a solution to problems  create a new approach to doing things and you have to be modest that ' s why i refer to the first slide big- headed graduate screws up from top jobs cause the the the speaker the interviewee was saying so difficult to find that local talents who beat our standard and even if you find them they ' re so big-headed all right so modesty willingness to learn  someone who knows their own limitations somebody who ' s critical but constructive somebody who ' s hard-working and increasingly in recent years  global perspective what is happening several words what ' s happening as one word what do you think how do you compare what is happening to us as one word  as to the uh crack down on uh on uh corruption in the mainland what do you think of the middle east problem do you think the pakistanis uh will be uh pakistanians will get in a uh one word  so you you are expected to have a global perspective and to be sociable and outgoing and i ' ve been told by an employer that he knows of staff in his firm who are brilliant and hard-working several words but will never be promoted beyond the position  because they are not outgoing enough  so lastly you you have to look the path as well do you have to have two words  appropriate presence in my job uhm would you help students prepare for interviews and the employers a bit hesitated about what we do and i argue then  is that i am not trying to give them model answers to repeat because that will not do and that is being moral what we do is to told them truth make them think it through whether or not they are suitable for the job and why do they think they can do it and in doing so we need to this to a interesting her different aspirations and when i come to preparing students for the administrative office service system in the hong kong government which is one of the most  it ' s now no longer the highest paid job it ' s used to be the most  the highest paid job in in hong kong and i often i can often tell whether a person has that  presence alright so we are several words or presence i will review my age when i ' m saying the next thing  fanny law is one of our graduates  and she came to see me when she several words  in the ao and she certainly had good presence and so this is one word and the presence  appropriate presence several words  okay so this is what employers want so what i want to  one word bring out bring them out because they are now talking about local graduates how the local graduates maintain the competitive edge  so i assume those of you who are interested in this topic are probably thinking of should i go overseas to do my university degree  or should i stay in hong kong people have been saying that the standard of local graduates have deteriorated so much should i still waste my time to study in hong kong  and my answer is is certainly are not wasting time  alright and then besides giving you some evidence i want to show  you if you ' re interested in in investing in your degree  for the sake of employment then besides think of our which country to go for universal study or which institution if you you will do yourself better  a better service by knowing that no university is perfect none of the universities are perfect know what employers want see what a university can deliver that and make up the gap yourself so doesn't matter where you go to university alright alright so i go to several-words how  uh how uhm i apologize for the for uhm the wordings of this fly which is not quite correct and our colleague here from the english department is recording my presentation  several-words they would tell me where i did wrong and how i should improve my english so i look forward to hearing from them and how this should be 1 word  anyway what i want to say is what should we aim at achieving at the university  we should use it for an to become educated to be prepared for life these two are more important than this one do not think of using your university degree just for the world of work and don't just take a degree that is hot o in a job market that is the worst thing you can do for yourself i shall explain later on and we believe very much in our motif sapientia et virtus mihng dak gaak maht  to understand virtues be a moral person and you use your moral principle to understand matters and of course dak ji tai kwahn meih  this is what particularly one word  now why do i say preparing for the world of work is less important than the first two  firstly for the principle because it one word  wrong to go to a university just to prepare for one word  universities are not meant to do that technical institutions short executive courses short skills courses are meant to do that not a university alright so this is a principle sides but in practical does it work it does work this year i just heard on the last day uhm uh i just heard yesterday that one of the largest most prestigious management consultancy consulting firm in hong kong they review offers to our students including an offer to a student who was who was doing speech and hearing sciences  another major employer whose logo i ' ve shown 1 word three job offers to our graduates this year ' s final year student they had not been recruiting new graduates for a number of years  and one of them is a food and nutrition science student and one is a statistics student  and i ' ve four employers who would be coming to meet our students  because i told their 1 word i say that four employers and say you must come and meet those students although they are their gpas not high their public examination results in english chinese and mathematics un un uh unremarkable they are really very competent and motivated people come and see i put my reputation on the table come and  1 word them and they say yes i say gradually i ' m not going to delegate  several-words i am coming myself the chief executive is coming themselves and the students whom i ' m going to refer to them biology  history fine art several words and public administration politics and public administration and i ask several-words why did you do  pub politics and public administration because i like it  good for you so why do you come to hong kong u because the students have a lot of fun at hong kong u i said good for you that ' s the purpose of education and then people would say that ' s very well for you to say  because you are paid by hong kong u  but my own two children one has finished university  one is doing a second year both of them are in literal arts they went to they study in melbourne u so i know the strength there and i can see that ' s why they said overseas university has some strength but they have something bad they  several words that that my children do not have and uh and my yet elder son gave up turn down an offer to do business administration for philosophy i said son can you do that are you sure there ' s no market in philosophy he said why should i do business administration i know 2 words in the prospectus  it ' s common sense these are things that i can really one word  my own and learn on my own why should i waste three years of my youth to do something that i can read on my own i said why philosophy because i don't understand it 1 word read it on my own i need somebody to explain it to me i said good for you alright and he kept on choosing subject  several-words that he was poor at instead of descriptive philosophy like the philo indian philosophy chinese philosophy he chose metaphysics the philosophy of science which he didn't score high  and that is the purpose of education my younger one had an offer to do law and if he really push himself he can do a double degree law and commerce again he said no see what is 2 words i ' ve been also believed  several words doing japanese and chinese so i think i put my money when i ' m 2 words  i put my children several words and i claim looking at how they blossom how they enjoy their university life how they grow as they ' re educated and i hope ethical person not quite educated yet they ' re still on the way there  but this is what i several words in myself  now uh so uh i just go then quickly into uhm  uh how universities in hong kong do this of course we had our academic progress which many of my colleagues from hong kong u and from the other institutions would have  1 word to you and let me just show you some of the other non-academic programs that we have and i ' m sure all the other institutions have similar programs in fact one of my colleagues uhm her daughter went to cambridge study studies in the cambridge study studying chemistry in cambridge so during the holidays she comes in with her mom and  and comes to our fountain she said then what is more fun studying in hong kong u the students had more things to do than at cambridge so i ' m sure all the institutions in hong kong had various programs  now we talk about we prefer more programs and many of these programs involve a student not just from hong kong but  several words these programs we usually include  some from overseas and some from the mainland say a group of students from architecture students from harvard  and some from ching wah and fuk daan  and hong kong and hong kong u they spend one month together traveling to various cities in america in north america europe and in the mainland and then they come back working a in a group are asked to redesign a particular a specific city in china so many of these programs uh uhm uhm include uh the uh is  uh is a is a multi national group
