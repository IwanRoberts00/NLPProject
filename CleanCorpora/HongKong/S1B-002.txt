""
""
now i hope you still remember the proper way of tackling this
question
""
i told you already
""
uh for any open-end question you have to state very definitely
whether you are for or against
""
and give reason
""
huh
""
give reason
""
don't try to analyse  recording stops and restarts 
""
now for example just like girls suppose i say  do you think
secondary students should  have steady boyfriend or girlfriend something
like that
""
now you answer this question  you have to make it very clear
from the beginning
""
i think  secondary student should not  have  steady
boyfriend or girlfriend
""
and then  what follows are all the reason  to support your
disapproval of  secondary student having boyfriend or girlfriend
""
steady boyfriend or girlfriend
""
understand
""
nah don't start  list out all the advantages and the
disadvantages
""
uh because  if if the question put in this way  what are the
 advantages and disadvantages then you  ' ll prove it
""
but if it ask for your opinion  now you  ' ll have to choose to
make your choice first
""
yes or what
""
no
""
and then follow your trend
""
understand
""
nah otherwise if many  many time the people student they try to
what
""
analyse the question instead of answering the question
""
give all the pros and all the cons
""
and only finally one  statement
""
i think sometime is okay you know if depends on individual case
then uh you get the mark
""
is it clear girls you have to be very clear with your what
""
your fact
""
all right
""
nah this type of question i told you already
""
okay
""
now let  ' s continue with the topic in care for the old
""
i think we have nearly finished everything except the bible
passages  tell us very clearly the christian perspective or the typical
view point or what what other shall we say
""
uhm  the teaching according to the bible right
""
all these different things regarding care for the old
""
so now girls have i given you the tips already
""
okay let  ' s look at that one
""
now care for the old
""
now before i go on any question
""
now let us look at  the message given here 
""
very direct
""
very clear cut
""
you can see huh
""
very direct and very clear cut
""
the first passage is taken from leviticus  take-off or landing
sound  
""
 a few words 
""
okay versus thirty two
""
only three line
""
which do you think are the key words here
""
huh
 
""
respect 
""
""
 show respect 
""
anything else
""
 honour them 
""
all right
""
the key words about
""
now  like here  why fear me i am the lord 
""
now let us look at this
""
from the old testament or the new testament
 
""
old 
""
""
in the old testament
""
 now you understand why they do fear me 
""
now actually what does it mean
""
they talking about all that all the time
""
why did they all use the word  fear me 
""
what does that mean
""
it is in those days understand uh it is the way that   p 
people will be what
""
listen would be convinced
""
understand uh they use the word fear doesn't really mean really
like what you have so scared of
""
you know
""
the the word fear in those days  actually more of the what
""
aspect
""
understand  a cantonese explanation of  ' fear ' used in the bible
""
""
do you understand
""
okay
""
nah for here even the three sentences here tell us to  not just
to respect them but to honour them
""
now of course girl if i want ask you to elaborate  you must be
able to ask why do we have to honour the old people
""
come on
""
although it don't say here why do we have to honour the old people
""
uh who would like to answer this question
""
suppose i say  the leviticus tell us to show respect and honour
the old people why
""
nobody knows
""
and what is  the fact the the the point of having all these
lessons we  ' re talking about care for the old
""
why do we have to honour the old people
""
when you honour somebody that means somebody is really worth for
you to what
""
to honour
""
why
""
come on 
""
always like this to put your head down you know
""
now don't forget even if you put your head down i still can call
you
""
you have a sitting chart here
""
nah i must admit i cannot  know i still do not know all the
names of all of you
""
only you know a number of you
""
so it  ' s no point putting your head down
""
doesn't help
""
come on
""
why do we have to honour the old people
""
just a simple question
""
you will be you should help your blessing if you all of a sudden
get this question for the test or an exam
""
nobody can answer me huh   take-off or landing sound 
""
ida 
""
right because they have done their part
""
they have contributed to what
""
society
""
understand uh
""
they have played their role
""
understand
""
and  two-words   fulfil  their role 
nurturing the what
""
nurturing the young
""
do you understand this is most important part
""
without them how can you the younger generation
""
okay
""
the next one
""
the next paragraph  show appreciation for the aged parents
""
now look  for the first passage is in fact the second paragraph
to show its appreciation
""
now  versus twenty two
""
ask them what 
""
listen to your father
""
without him you would not exist 
""
yes or no
""
why do we have to show our  appre  appreciation
""
well without your father actually without your parent you will not
be here
""
also  when your mother is old show her the appreciation
""
""
now if they find it funny  how come
""
it separate the father and the mother don't forget they always
mention father first because again is a male-dominating society at that time
right
""
now then go on 
""
versus twenty four  you have to  why if you uh
 to show appreciation and do the right thing your father your parents
should be happy because they can take pride in a wise son 
""
is this true
""
if you do well if you do well
""
do you think your parent will feel proud of you
""
yes or no
""
yes
""
they have always say this suppose  they were receiving award
understand uh they came first that they did a great job  the parent they
feel so proud of them right
""
and then they answer to what
""
 make your mother make your father and mother proud of you
""
give them or give or mother back  
""
actually girls there  ' s a very good verse in proverb in the verse
twenty
""
it is not printed here
""
but i like that very much
""
that proverb verse goes like this  we admire the strength
of youth 
""
all right because young people always full of what
""
strength
""
full of energy like  f  full of vitality
""
 and we will respect the grey hair age 
""
now you see the the  when you are young you admire  but when
you come to the grey hair age to what we have to what
""
respect
""
and actually i think i did say this before
""
i want to repeat
""
now when you want to give your  parent happiness  in a way
you are giving yourself happiness
""
now remember told you i told you once to pay attention what
""
when we pray for our parent actually we are praying for what
""
for yourself
""
because suppose we say we ask god to bless our parent to give them
good health okay
""
so is it in a way you ask god to bless
""
uh if your parents are in good health you don't have to worry
""
yes or no
""
uh you don't have to spend so much time okay uh you looking after
them
""
do you understand
""
so you could use your time to do something else
""
so it is that you are asking god okay to bless  two words
  take-off or landing sound  always to do that
""
it  ' s not just your parents
""
if you ask god to bless  a few words  
take-off or landing sound  i bet you all know that okay  a few
words 
""
now the second thing
""
 the church should help those who are alone 
""
now what does this
""
this seems to be the same idea as we what say
""
the government should what
""
should look after old homeless childless what
""
elder the elderly
""
right
""
the same thing here
""
but in those days of course do you know that girls in those days
in those uh in those in those days community church plays a very important
part
""
church is actually like the head figure okay of the authority
""
understand
""
right now so you see  nah it says that   if any
christian woman has widows in her family she must take care of the and not
put the burden on the church 
""
now what does this apply to
""
what we have been saying
""
come on
""
it  ' s the same as what have said
""
 but the widow if any christian women   again
 women  is actually could refer to family  has widows in her
family 
""
widow means somebody who has lost her what
""
husband
""
and nobody to look after
""
 but if their family lack member 
""
what does that mean
""
 they must be taken care of 
""
okay
""
and don't put the burden on what
""
church
""
this is exactly what the government is trying to do
""
encourage those  elderly to live with the family so that the
family take up the what
""
responsibility  take-off or landing sound 
""
but underline
""
nah they say that  not that the church is so unhelpful but
the church would like to keep  understand uh   their
resources to help  the what
""
 take care of the widow who are all alone 
""
so now you see can see in those days uh their way of thinking is
actually similar to ours
""
listen uh  those with the family family should look after
them
""
those without family the church  you know the church or we
say the government uh  should to take up the  responsibility
 right
""
the next two passages girls
""
 the younger generation should care for the older
generation  
""
so girls you see what we  ' re  talk  talking about that they
are all what
""
shown in the what
""
bible passages
""
okay now all these value
""
now it  ' s taken from ruth
""
now uh ruth is a book in what testament again
""
do you know
""
the old testament
""
now do you know who is this ruth
""
r u t h
""
okay now it is a ruth is a very good woman
""
and he is she is so good that she  ' s willing to look after her
mother-in-law
""
now not her own mother but her husband  ' s what
""
mother
""
even after the death of what
""
husband
""
understand
""
very generous
""
now and this woman show concern and care to old people
""
she is loyal and faithful to her mother-in-law
""
she is every humble
""
very courageous
""
very generous
""
this woman huh
""
actually very similar to  the very traditional daughter-in-law
in the chinese society
""
versus thirteen
""
 your daughter-in-law 
""
somebody is talking to okay talking to this woman
""
this woman huh this mother-in-law
""
versus thirteen uh
""
 your daughter-in-law loves you and has done more for you
than seven sons 
""
does it mean that this woman really have seven son
""
do you know this mystery of this figure seven
""
you know that means they  represents what
""
many
""
seven
""
they like the to use the word seven like jesus said people
remember people ask jesus  how many times you have  for  forgive
people
""
what did jesus say  several replies 
""
""
not just seven times but what  several replies 
""
""
it  ' s seven times  seventy seven  times you know
""
but it is not
 
""
eighteen times seven 
""
""
seventy times seven
""
something like that
""
oh whether is seventeen times seven or seven it still a number
""
but it doesn't mean jesus doesn't mean that even seventeen times
seven  three words  four times four  two words
 finish
""
not that
""
that means seven means many times already okay
""
if seventy times seven means what
""
many many many times
""
understand
""
uh this is a funny i don't why they choose seven
""
uh you know that time many people like to choose seven as their
luck number okay
""
now  and now she has given you a grandson  look
not just that  this woman not mother her mother but give you a grandson
""
and why is it so good for this woman to give a grandson to her
mother-in-law because the grandson  will bring you life to you and
give you security in your old age 
""
now what does that mean
""
what does this mean
""
that means this ruth is so good not as she herself has looked the
old woman
""
okay
""
but make sure that if the mother-in-law uh the mother-in-law is so
so what
""
long life okay can live for so long that they have a son
""
don't forget son
""
very important
""
okay uh so that feel very secure
""
uh  love the old and make them feel secure 
""
now actually what this mean here
""
we have to love the old
""
and not just say that you love them
""
just sit there you know opposite to them i love you i love you it  ' s
no use
""
okay
""
love them make them feel what
""
secure and comfortable and happy
""
uh i think we talked about this
""
okay
""
you don't just  put them at home and say okay now look 
there  ' re food in the refrigerator
""
there you know is a room for you to live you know what else do you
want
""
now even if if your attitude is like this
""
do you think they feel secure
""
they don't feel secure
""
because you don't show that you are so willing you are willing
understand uh
""
it  ' s the willingness that you want to show the old people
""
okay
""
right now the next passage about timothy
""
now underline its versus wait versus  four
""
versus four  which is  if a widow has children or
grandchildren they should learn first to carry their religious duty towards
their own family and  underline  this way repay their parent
and grandparent 
""
repay  now  repay their parent and grandparent 
how do they repay
""
of course  that means what
""
look after them
""
take care of them
""
 because that is what pleases god 
""
simply tell us they are doing this because that  ' s what god wants
you to do
""
and you know in those days understand uh  the way to argue you
think that look you have to do what what want you to do or else you will be
what
""
punish
""
okay
""
so uh this is the way now
""
further down versus eight   but if anyone does not take
care of his relatives especially the members if his own family  now
 he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever 
""
now this make it very clear cut
""
if you are a christian  if you are a christian what do you do
""
looking after family member especially the old ones
""
in that case your what
""
duty
""
d u t y
""
okay
""
now if you don't do it  you will be even worse than a what
""
unbeliever
""
that means you are non-christian
""
now because being a christian is your duty
""
and if you don't do it that mean you don't perform the duty of a
christian
""
so what is the difference between you and an non-christian
""
do you understand donna
""
after this passage you could see very clear that according to the
christian perspective  we should have to respect the old honour them
""
okay
""
uh the young one should what
""
take care of the old one
""
make them feel secure happy
""
okay
""
be loyal to them
""
right
""
because this is you are not doing them a favour
""
because this is our what
""
duty
""
okay
""
this is our duty
""
that something we should do
""
now the last last uh passage god care for people when they are old
""
now versus four  i am your god   now actually uh
wait a minute uh second line of versus three  i have cared for you
from the time you were born
""
and i  ' m your god and i will take care of you until you are old
and your hair is grey 
""
now this is the reassurance given to god i mean given by god to
the old people
""
so the people so people in general think that the day when you
were born the god uh god has already what
""
blessed you taking care of you
""
so when you get old god will look out
""
nah then you say how
""
how can god look out
""
actually what this means
""
god will make sure those who believe in him know their duty
""
understand uh the young one to look after the what
""
the old one
""
that if they they perform the will of god
""
you got it
""
so it  ' s quite straight forward these passages you know
""
nothing uhm difficult to understand
""
now any questions girls
""
now i hope did you get anything did you get something about old
people from the newspaper cutting recently
""
now i just want to remind you huh newspaper log book okay uh
""
you just have to uh do it continuously uh  an overlapped
sentence. a student said she had not collected a piece of the newspaper
cutting so far 
""
okay
""
you don't wait until the day i  ' ve said the week i said would you
please hand in the log book
""
you start thinking it out
""
you won't be able to get enough material
""
okay
""
nah if no question we have to move because we are really short of
time
""
the next topic 
""
sense of sense of vocation and work
""
uh something you have never  thought  of but we have
already talked about it what 
""
all right  has been included there  a paragraph
""
now would you please try to uh  find out from your own
understanding  and  your knowledge  about the meaning of this word w
o r k
""

""
