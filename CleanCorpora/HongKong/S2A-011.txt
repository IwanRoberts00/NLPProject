<I>
welcome atv viewers to trackside this wednesday evening from
happy valley racecourse let ' s get straight into the live action with race
three 
we ' re looking at the paddock parade for this race number three
on the programme we ' re up to flowers pride he ' s drawn barrier eight he ' s
drifting out in the betting 
he ' s twenty five to one 
he ' s had a couple of runs this season 
is he stripping any fitter for this one mark 
uh to be honest david he ' s looked uh reasonably good for all
of them uh he is a horse who takes the eye he ' s uh quite a good looking type
but uh i think my uh assessment of him now would be disappointing he ' s just
not come on 
i thought when he first worked in the blinkers that was just what he
needed to keep his concentration 
quite frankly i ' m disappointed with him 
he he looks good from the paddock uh absolutely nothing wrong with
him here 
but his performances have been pretty mediocre
yes he hasn't lived up to what he was showing in the trials i
put the pen straight through flowers pride and here is the favourite now
winning luck uh from barrier five robbie fradd aboard him 
robbie ' s got a pretty good record he almost got him to victory on
his first start this season over the fourteen hundred metres he ' s a two time
winner here 
i just don't know whether this is his race or not he ' s got the
speed to be on the pace 
which will be an advantage but i could find others with stronger
claims 
yep uh winning luck uh as i say i thought he was a place
chance uh a win proposition uh i ' d be a little bit wary of 
uh from the other side of the paddock he looks absolutely fine when
he gets round to this side we ' ll tell you what he looks like close up but uh
uh he ' s certainly isn't a negative from where i am here 
yeah well obviously someone ' s ringing the bells about him
because uh he ' s run creditably but he ' s been a bit one paced 
i supposed he runs like that all of the time 
but uh i i just thought he ' s going to get a good position 
four point one about him kicking the best in the straight 
i ' m a little bit unsure whether that ' s a realistic price 
he ' s now four point two as we speak 
five melrose star this is the horse we are all talking about as
appearing to be a little bit over priced 
uh eddie lai takes the ride on him 
so his regular rider douglas white has jumped off and the public
have said no way jose we don't want him either 
he ' s got a good gate he should get a good position midfield and
just needs a bit of luck 
he looks in great order too absolutely glowing from the
paddock nothing that i can see visibly wrong with this horse 
he uh looks very well in himself 
he can get fired up some evenings but uh certainly not tonight uh
uh i ' m very happy with him uh i think this is good value 
well his lone success here was over eighteen hundred metres uh
last season it took him a long time to win that first race 
he will be drifting back and stay for that one last sprint wide
around the field melrose star 
it ' s a merely a matter if uh the race pans out to his satisfaction
bold victory not racing well and uh gate number twelve ensures that
he is going to have to do a lot of work if he ' s going to get into that
forward position where he does do his best racing when right 
yes uh just literally walked in to the paddock so uh david
have you got anything to say about him at the moment because i haven't even
seen him 
uh he ' s drawn a wide gate he ' s going to press forward isn't
he but no not for me 
i found it a bit hard to have him from that barrier draw 
he ' s uh drawn twelve he ' s going to be wide and doing a bit of
work to get over that was the reason i said no about him 
i think there ' s uh another reason that you say that uh
performance when he decided he was going to go via the bar at the football
club uh on that first bend it wouldn't exactly encourage you with his gate
here 
uh it looks alright from the other side of the paddock again we ' ll
catch up with him very shortly uh but fun manager the horse on screen at the
moment 
well i think they ' re was excuses for him last time excuses
that i don't like to hear 
uh he was scoped afterwards and uh there was a certain amount of
blood in his trachea 
wasn't deemed to have bled though uh but he looks very light to
me i uh not struck by this horse at all darren
no i think he struck his opportunity earlier this season in
that real weak race where he uh sat outside spectacular win and there was a
neck between them he just hasn't come on since then 
there was no depth to that and that was his chance 
seventy one fifty 
certainly are others that are much better priced and have better
claims and i would arte this one as one of them qui vivra verra 
we haven't seen him since the twenty seventh of october but he ran
his usual consistent race when third behind win mark 
he ' s a two time winner here 
he ' s certainly been a revamped horse as the years have gone on 
and i think if he gets across from gate nine 
gets a sit behind the speed he ' s a must for the multiple players
yeah qui vivra verra just wonder where he might be in the run
here uh not drawn ideally in nine he normally goes forward uh and sits fairly
prominently 
uhm he does look well he ' s a horse who carries plenty of condition
on him every time he comes in he looks like he could do with one more run but
that ' s just him in general appearance anyway so no need to be
negative about him uh certainly not the worst from the paddock 
no i thought he battled well the other day as well it ' s a
little while since that run but he ' s got a great chance good price too 
nine mission possible 
uh just wait and see how he goes here 
uh don't like him uhh one or two spots around on him uh plenty
light enough uh if he didn't have a couple of spots you ' d say he looked
quite well actually he ' s got the old cross nose band on him as well to try
and keep his mouth shut 
uh but i ' m not overly taken by him 
obviously when he opens his mouth he ' s not nice 
do they come in your size 
oh ho thank you very much 
got to say when he was first up in that uh no race he wasn't
in a very good position at the time he missed the start 
his trial earlier on this season was very very slow 
watch me win has had a number of barrier trials some of them have
them have been okay he goes out at thirty three to one 
and here he is off a mark of thirty eight following is four
disappointing runs last term 
he ' s quite a striking horse this to see uh watch me win 
could do with just strengthening up a fraction there ' s not a great
deal of him but he looks very fit uh he ' s been very much on his toes from
the minute he came in here and 
uh he ' s a bright chestnut with a big white nose roll on him you
wouldn't miss him quickly and uh 
i don't dislike him quite frankly he may just need to uh strengthen
up a fraction more but he certainly looks fit and well 
yeah i expect him tonight on the third line your
deserving to get a big price about him but i think he ' s improved a lot from
last season watch me win 
seen him a couple of times gallop in the morning and a bit
different than when i saw him last year 
noble boy ' s five point two it seems that tony millard ' s got this
guy going really well 
remember he was an ish that ' s quite good on paper but just battled
in his first fourteen runs 
i know at the back end of the season he got close but he should
have probably won one of those 
is five point two too short about him 
uh yeah i think it is to short about him quite frankly but uh
he ' s a very strong horse he ' s been kept out since that uh run
over the thousand metres uh i ' m happy enough the way he looks in here
doesn't look the worst at all even after his uh little 
visit to the barbers uhm he ' s a strong individual he certainly
looks as if he ' s very fit in deed 
uh i think he ' s got every chance of placing i wouldn't want to
stand him out as a win bet 
i know you ' re rather keen on him though darren 
well well i ' ve gotta say if he runs up to that first up over
the thousand metres 
and if he runs up to the trials he ' s been turning in 
i think he deserves this quote of four point nine i think he ' ll
win the race 
uhm i think he has genuinely improved and he was finally getting to
put some decent form together at the back end of the previous season uh for
laurie fownes 
magic win number eleven he ' s forty eight dollars fifty i think he ' s
got the speed to put himself in an ideal spot here from barrier number six he
has won here in the past and douglas white aboard him tonight 
looks perfectly okay uh can't see any negatives with this uh
gray horse magic win 
uh he ' s never really a particularly eye catching type because of
the way he ' s been thrown together he just doesn't to uh to be particularly
good physically 
but uh he ' s a very consistent sort of horse 
uh i just couldn't have him as a win proposition here he ' s just
one of many with a chance 
yeah i like the way he went in his sprint race first up that ' s
normally not his go to be that competitive in the grade he took on 
over that distance and uh as we saw last time over the four race he
was going to be in front quite comfortably well he was actually 
tweet twenty to one 
hard to run with a name like that i ' d be thinking 
yeah i don't think uh he ' s going to be seen at his best
either here at happy valley for me this horse has got a bit of size and scope
about him he ' d be much better off uh at sha tin 
and so it ' s proved on his previous visits to here at the city
track he ' s never looked 
like a horse who ' s going to unwind quickly enough to make his
presence felt at the business end of a race 
umm he is he ' s definitely doing better now physically but he ' s
getting fairly warm he ' s got a big thick winter coat on him and uh fails
really to take the eye still 
and incidentally bold victory getting very warm indeed i don't
think that ' s a good sign with him 
and so is fun manager he ' s got quite a sweat on now
