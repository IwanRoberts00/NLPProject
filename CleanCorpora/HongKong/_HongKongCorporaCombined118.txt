okay now i would like to have your notebook with you because i ' m going to discuss something which you have nothing to refer to you have to depend on listening we are going to do a bit of discussion today  yes please hurry up you should have your english notebook somewhere i ' ve told you to have one ready  yes have you got your notebook    a few words yes  notebook please  yes   my english book is at home  what is it   uh we have done their uh diary in the  you shouldn't do that i asked the class to have a book for english notes isn't it dairy is another thing altogether diary is a journal something you write at home you ' ve han handed it or use a piece of paper now and when you get your diary back you should start a new a book  now what i ' m going to do actually is to ask you uh to ask you ' re opinion about yes what is it sabrina nothing i ' m going to ask your opinion about uh one point so far we have been using a textbook is that right and then uh that textbook has all the format for the examination but then uhm this is non-literary i wonder if you know what is lit literature you know what is literature and literature is grouped to the two types one with a capital l and one with the small letter l i wonder if you remember when i did i teach you for literature in form three several replies  some of you yes some of no uh those that i did with you in form three i explained about what literature is literature capital letter is a subject to which you study the writings and styles of the writers and small letter refers to anything which is printed so this that i ' m holding here is a piece of literature because there are words there you read from it this is literature small letter okay but then with a capital letter it refers to a subject in which you study the styles and the ways the words are used what i would like you to uhm do is to think for a short moment  what is according to you what is the uh literary value all right you know what i mean by litera literary value do you think uhm that literature all right uh writings done by great writers like shakespeare uhm charles dickens should be included in your english lessons because so far all you ' ve been doing would be about uh uhm general topics uh who and then trans uh communication transportation ghosts and so on they are just written by the writer the author of the textbook but i ' m asking you now coughing but i ' m asking you now is do you think that if you have poems as your english lesson what do you think several replies  well i would like you to think about don't think no or yes think about it first uhm several replies     a few words both sides are  think about it   like stories  all right have you finished   no  now after you have thought it here are a few questions i want you to answer you may jot down your answers in your uh book in your notebook let ' s take a word like fire what is fire write it down what is fire  now tr try to write to write a sentence in which you have the word fire used okay so what is fire you have to give an example and use this fire as one of the words in your group of words understand me i repeat here ' s my question what is fire got it now the next thing you are going going to do is to take this word fire and write a sentence or a group of words with the word fire in it do so now  just answer this question simple what is fire so answer this question if you don't know what i want you to do your next question is what is ice  again give an example of how you will use this word in a sentence okay  just make up any sentence  have you finished  okay let ' s have one of you to read me your first sentence uhm shall we have germane please germane can read your answer to the first question what is ice uh sorry what is fire just read from your your sentence   fire is the flame with yellow in colour  yes fire is the flame with yellow in colour how will you correct this i think there is a slight mistake there how will you correct your sentence she said fire is a flame with yellow in colour can you improve that  fire is   fire is a flame with yellow and red  well she said fire is a flame with yellow and black how about yours yellow and  red okay and how about yours well here uhm that ' s bernice uh her answer is that we can burn something with fire  and how about yours yours from francis she said uh there ' s fire come quickly h  help uhm that is interesting and then the other one for ice let ' s see what you have for ice what is ice would you put some ice into the coke please uhm uhm and you have not finished have you finished   i haven't finished  you haven't finished okay and how about yours what have you written for ice ice is something that will melt no s melt in high temperature uhm uhm and germane yours is ice is the solid form of water this is very scientific okay so this is the different answers you give now we call all these except one case which i won't call it uh non-literary i think she has a very who has that hell yes i think her use of fire is dramatic now she said ice is solid form of water and she said fire uhm there ' s fire in hell right now these two are different ways of writing taking the first one i would that dramatic taking the other one i would call that scientific or a statement do you know what i ' m trying to show you right then let ' s go to another question what is a young man what is a young man now we are thinking of the non-literary we are not trying to make it dramatic all right so don't think of anything dramatic yet just think of uhm an ordinary answer or an on a an ordinary use of the words young man  what have you written about the young man  now remember your sentence should have the word young man there young man  what have you got fiona yes shall we hear it   a young man is very handsome and students ' laughter he has his own business and he is very rich  oh so has that ' s your dream boy good okay you have got that and how about you wendy   young man is about sixteen year years old and like more outdoor activities  and and likes more outdoor activities fine that ' s very good i think you all know the use of uhm of the words now the next one the the fourth question is what is a young woman you ' ve got the sentence for young man now would you please give an example of a sentence with young woman  okay yes rebecca have you got your sentence written  sabrina have you finished  ooh hurry up please  your lesson will not finish at three twenty it will be half past three  right you should have finished by now candy what is your sentence about young woman    no    a young woman is walking down on the street who is very beautiful a young woman comma walking down the street is very beautiful i ' ve co i ' ve corrected her sentence already and how about yours uh what is it will you read it out   a young woman ' s age is around fifteen to twenty five years old and she is very beautiful  so young woman in your opinion a young woman is or young women plural are always beautiful okay we all are students ' laughter now look at look at your sentences look at the sentences you ' ve made what do you feel about it do you think that it is a statement a definition or giving information look at your own because each of you each one of you have a different form uh i mean different sentence so what kind of sentence have you written sabrina chan yours is a definition could you read out your sentence read it aloud yes your well have the fire one   fire is a flame one word in red in colour yes so what you call that a definition is it a definition unidentified speech  i think it is more of an information because if you define fire i don't think you define it that way you have to look up your sci coughing excuse me your science in form one or form two isn't it when fire is explained something that produce heat is that right fire produces heat that would be  information isn't it okay now think of where would we usually use words with definition if you are giving a definition where will you find them uhm   dictionary  yes bernice   dictionary  from a dictionary good where else where else maggie  where else besides a dictionary where else will you find uhm this these  sentences  i think i ' ve just mentioned it uhm  come on where do we study about about ice about fire several replies from science isn't it from science books and how about man young man and woman vivien unidentified speech  yes besides dictionary where else do we find these words young man young woman beautiful handsome yes   books  story books uhm uhm that ' s right story books okay now here i have another example listen to it  what is a youth impetuous fire what is a maid ice and desire  so here are four lines  what is a youth impetuous fire what is a maid ice and desire  in these four lines there are two words given what are the two words that you have heard in the earlier part ice and fire several replies  notice that this is not ordinary not ordinary sentences isn't it what do you call that  what is a youth impetuous fire what in a maid ice and desire unidentified speech </o yes   a poem  well you may call it poem but i think you ' ll just call a verse or lyrics you remember the word lyrics l y r i c s lyrics they are for song that ' s why i stared off with a song luckily my voice is a bit okay today that ' s why i can try and give you this it is actually uh the theme song from romeo and juliet have you hea have you seen this film okay now this is what we call the literary use of language we are using the words but we are making it i mean we are using it in the uh in a way that has a style of its own so the first one could you write this down so that you can look at it again uh first line what is a youth question mark  youth y o u t h and then second line impetuous fire i m p e t u o u s impetuous fire full stop next line what is a maid m a i d a maid question mark and then the answer is the next line ice and desire you know this song can you sing it i think you can sing better than i can you sing it anyone can sing it i think there is some more to it isn't it uhm who is a good singer here unidentified speech  candy   no  do you know this song you don't know it unidentified speech  who knows it   connie  really connie would you try and sing this i i know you can sing much better than i try it humming the tune  ready laughter  okay i ' ll start the tune humming the tune  is it too high    what is a youth  impetuous fire what is a maid ice and desire   what is a youth  the world wax on a rose of youth  you know this a very beautiful song yes it ' s very good i think she sings much better than i let ' s give her a hand applause  well done okay right now my purpose in doing this is to make you or ask you to compare the two now in the first section here we i ' ve mentioned about fire i ' ve mentioned ice and now i ' ve gone on to same topic ice and fire mentioned and then we have young man but this time instead of young man which word have i used i mean which word is being used instead of young man which is the other word   youth  and instead of young woman which word several replies maid so now we have two groups of words ice fire maid and youth young man young woman question number one now what is the difference between a maid and a youth to the author  what is the difference between a maid and a youth to the author now try to answer it what do you think is the difference  uh perhaps you leave two lines i ' ll give you a a number of questions because we may not have enough time to finish it off but anyway i ' ll give you all those questions and we ' ll discuss it uh next question leave one or two lines will be enough do you agree with the author ' s definitions now you find that the author of those four lines is saying something about what is a youth and what is a maid do you agree  what is the answer to what is a youth according to the author  several replies  it is impetuous fire and the answer to what is a maid ice and desire  overlaps with several replies  that ' s right so try to think of that and from the four lines your next question please it ' s number three isn't it now for your next one according to those four lines what can you tell about the author and try to guess whether whether the author is a young person an adult is the person a male or female and why do you think that person is young or why do you think that person is old you have to base your answer on those four lines there give yourself about three or four lines and then go on to the next because i would like you to work on it at home and we ' ll continue discussing it next time okay and for the four lines uhm where would you find them or i should say what kind of books will you find them you understand me just then in the earlier section i asked you where would you find those words those answers you gave and you mentioned from the dictionary from science textbook and perhaps from story books and how about these four lines where do you think you will find them bell rings  and leave yourself two lines the next one is number five what is the purpose of those four lines  and i ' ll give you those uh examples for examples is it uh to define does it tell us feelings and attitudes define to define question mark to express feelings and attitudes question mark or to arouse your imagination a r o u s e to arouse your imagination
