uh welcome to the gis seminar and three d visualization uh in this session we ' ll simply introduce uh what gis and what kind of uh service that we can do and uh we also specialize in three d presentation if one day you think you want to present your idea in three d you can come to us or you can come to us to learn or we can learn together okay uh first of all uh i would like to welcome everybody to this seminar uh uh we are from rising more limited my name is vincent chan and the guy is who ' s go going to do the demonstration is yves dehouck is he he ' s also one of the gis consultant in our company  i want to know how many of you have been working with gis or you are really interested in gis  please raise your hand  just one okay so the rest is for three d so maybe we talk in private and we have three d demonstration okay but anyway we register to have this seminar so we would like to start with the gis first but before i start i would like to let you know uh  what ' s rising more it seems the name is strange right it ' s doesn't like a cad expert or nothing related to cad the name is irrelevant and actually rising more limited is expert in providing cad solution uh and we are working closely with lots of great company to do uh cad system and also we provide cad and database linkage okay so actually uh we ' ll have a concept of the gis explain to you  that ' s what we are expert in  that ' s the topic  okay actually uh we are a group of people who are really uh keen in gis we want to do more on on cad that ' s why uh we provide all the services related to cad and we organize a group of a user group call cad role if you got the information brochure you ' ll see we organize a  user group call cad role and we have almost sixty members uh now we start our first meeting on on on first of may and we now have sixty members uh some of them from corporation some of them from individual actually we work together to see how can we improve the cad status in hong kong or if you are draughtsman or you ' re cad people how can we make more recogni nition for us in this society okay and uhm we also uh provide service in doing the gis okay now i would like to explain what ' s the concept of gis  actually gis is not a mystery it ' s really easy and simple  before i start gis uh i think some course in university about cadography i thought it ' s not so difficult but after i touch the gis too i found it ' s interesting and it ' s not that difficult actually the gis is two things combine together the cadd and dbi the cadd is computer-aided design and draughting okay we usually have uh in old in the past people usually have their own display system they would their they would have their graphic engine for the gis okay  that ' s why they always have problem because uh usually if you are specialize in database you may not specialize in computer graphics so you when you update the database you may not update the graphic engine or up update the other part so uhm in the early eighties people try to use the stated graphic engine like autocad to develop their gis package so they use autocad as their graphic engine to display all the visualization thing in autocad and they can link up with different database management program like oracle uh even uh dbase four uh informake different kind of database can be linked together especially uhm autocad has their ase okay uh autocad sico extension that you can link your cad drawing in a with a database okay actually gis is this ju just the concept okay what ' s the common operation in gis okay first is to locate okay for example if i got an application to do uh just for example to do uh chain store management or i am the boss of seven-eleven  i want to know how many store i have in tsim sha tsui or in certain area okay maybe i live in uh tsim sha tsui i want to know where can where ' s the closest uh seven-eleven store or how many alternative that i have or where ' s my competitor okay i can locate it on the map if you have a directory you can go through the directory but you don't know where ' s the exact location if you look at nathan road okay maybe you just turn around in a side street in next to nathan road and you don't know where it  is but in a map they can connect with the database then you can see and later on yves will demonstrate you how can we put two things together okay and you may have conditional search okay if i ' m a jimage people i want to see uh how ' s the jimage system in my area or how ' s the jimage system near the governor ' s area i don't want he got problem and complain to my department so i would like to fix all the jimage within one mile  in his house around his house so i can have conditional search  search provide me all the information about the jimage  within one mile around the governor ' s house so you can set the conditional okay uh maybe give me all the inform uh all the information about the jimage system that haven't been maintained for last five years okay you can have give you can give condition on the date on the time or on the cause of anything okay at the annotation uh there ' re some text that ' s not related with the database okay  may maybe there are symbol of the some uh texts uh say this is a line three or whatever okay some annotation is also put it there or spatial analysis okay the spatial analysis is uh spatial is something like a space maybe two d or three d i want to check uh where the closet hospital in my area or if i ' m a airline management people  accidentally there ' s uh we have to put on another airline to vancouver because so much people going there so where ' s the closest crew that i can call them back to the office okay you can have a spatial analysis tell me give me all the lists of my our employee that ' s  near the airport within five mile so they can be there maybe in ten minute so there ' s a spatial analysis you can do some analysis  or network analysis for example, i i ' m controlling all the uh water supply okay if the some water pipe damage in nathan road who will be in uh  affected and which area should i turn off the all the water supply in order to fix the water pipe okay actually if you want to evaluate a gis system it ' s all these included okay uhm there ' s a basic concept and i want to show you a drawing  this is a cad data model uhm if you use autocad before you know that autocad has different layer system actually when they display or when they display uh visually visual information they ' ll put different information in different layers in autocad or even in artcad or in other gis system they ' ll do the same thing for example i ' ll have uh the sports 1-word  street name or the utilities on different colour on different layer so you can view it directly okay and in the in the demonstration you ' ll see how we put different things together in different layer where ' s the building where ' s the utility okay where ' s the tip of the 1-word okay or how ' s the land use  and then oh you can do all these in cad why we need a gis system okay we do all these in cad but they have link directly to a database then it will have a gis data model okay all this is cad okay and this is database okay for example 1-word is a 1-word  uh a building or a a lot of of land how can it  connected to my database usually they will have a reference number or identifier you ' ll see so in the screen you ' ll see this but actually this area is linked up to record in a in the database file or they in the database they will interlink with other information sometimes you may have more than one database model maybe up to ten or twenty uh in our application we have more than ten database link up together so maybe uhm this is the 2 words but  you may have another database holding all the people ' s income or the land value or different information you can have different database link up together with the same  identifier so uhm this is a really typical gis what i what does it mean by typical gis when they start the gis they usually apply it to land information system or something like that okay but actually uhm for rising more we didn't do anything on this so we are not in gis field no we are because we feel that uh the gis is not only for big system like this it may be for example this what i explained before uhm  do some management on rendering machine or 1-word uh management system or a chain store management so we can apply to different vertical market with the same concept this drawing can clearly explain what we see in autocad and what it represent actually okay for this part is you what you see in autocad some land some arch some pattern  but you can't see what ' s in actually uh the autocad drawing represent a real area or real site uh as gis okay you ' ve may have building area okay uh maybe here ' s here ' s a 1-word that holding all the information about that piece of land who ' s the landlord who ' s the owner what ' s the value of the piec piece of land okay for example here is a pipeline actually is is a pipeline here  so the pipeline may be uh electrical line or it ' s a  telephone line or it ' s a water pipe supply or drainage or sewage it ' s different information can be kept so what you see in the drawing is represent this but all this information you may keep it in a database  okay but when we load up the drawing they interlink each other together  and it widely used worldwide people use all this they start using gis more and more because  we not only want to visualize it we want the information okay in the past we may have two thing a drawing paper and a list of the data they will merge okay then you don't know what ' s going on after 5 minute looking at different files but the the same thing we have pick the information for example pick the pipe in the drawing where is when was the pipe make or when ' s the last maintenance i don't know okay then quit autocad go into database look at the information of the pipe but now we integrate two things together we just pick the point we will see all the information of the pipeline because they link directly to the database file actually that ' s the concept of gis  because we don't have too much time i don't want to go through all my slides so uh i think yves has been waiting for long for his demonstration uhm in nineteen ninety one we start a project for  hutchison paging that ' s our first uh i think is yes nineteen ninety one we start the project for hutchison they said we need the system within three month finish all the map of hong kong for me finish the whole application design the database and within three months time we deliver them a system they are using it now they ' re really happy about it this system manage all the ct two station in hong kong yes do do you know what ct two the uh tien dey sien  he speak chinese i speak sort of english okay uhm and this system is integrated with database management and autocad and gis together maybe i pass the time to yves maybe you have you can brief your system a little bit  demonstration-by-yves  okay thank you yves  actually uh what you think about gis is not only uh  traditional uh geographic management or information system should be something more vertical i always think about ver the vertical market  not the land building and land user but the some of the commercial people maybe to the cathay pacific how to manage their staff  uh or coca-cola how to manage their rendering machine that ' s what kind of our vertical market that we concentrate on rather than the traditional uh gis application  okay uhm this uh if you got any question you can ask later or  you can go to the next room we ' ll be there for better full demonstration because what you see is around uh may be twenty percent of the system there ' s still lots of function that we don't have time to show  okay
