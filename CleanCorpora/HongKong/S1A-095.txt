<I>
so uhm how are you
i ' m good thanks 
 i know you ' re go i know you ' re really
busy this week
yeah when i think of the lesson plan for tomorrow
 zette 
i see oh yeah how is the class today
today i have form two and form one
form two and form one
like uhm you are doing english uh you ' re doing grammar and 
uh vocabulary and everything 
 yeah i was doing speaking and grammar
oh yeah it should be pretty tough
you know what like in form two
yeah
like one half of the class was not paying
attention right
 so 
oh yah i should be like about it you told me that
 other half was like doing their own thing
really oh my goodness so they ' re not really paying attention
to the class at all
yup i think they ' re the repeaters
oh really so they are not really form two or three students
 they are too old
 so could you 
oh dear 
 form two
oh no
they ' re sixteen years old
sixteen years old oh that should be like form
four no form five
 right 
yeah
oh dear oh dear
so wait a minute so what about those students that are really
active and i mean naughty
they are really eager and and they wanna see what you have to
write on the board and you have to tell them everything and then
they ask the questions
 okay 
so they are students who are uhm attentive
yes
but it just that the majority of them are really laughter
 naughty
oh that ' s hard
i mean it ' s so uh do you you know divide them into groups
no
so that they won't affect
 no 
 no because this is the whole class thing
okay
but the thing is i ' m trying to divide them into groups but
before that we have to give them instructions right
yah
the thing is they don't understand the instructions in english
oh
yeah
so
it ' s a low banding school so
no so what ' s the band if you don't mind telling me
band three
band three uhm 
 yeah the lowest band
but i ' m sure that there are students who are really uhm hard
working and uh who really want to learn
 yeah 
yeah
uhm
i just can't control the other half
oh
 the gap is too big
 i see 
how many students
forty
forty
forty
uh
yeah
that ' s a problem for local schools really
yeah
cos there ' s so many students and there ' s not much attention
and you can't use chinese to teach them english
i know of course not i mean that ' s going to no they ' re they ' re
going like you know laugh at you or something like that i think
they they did it to me 
 do you think so
do they they don't dare
i i tried it and then they teased me
you see you see 
no but no but i think the most important thing to be teacher is not
to be uhm you know teased
and you have dignity
you need dignity
i mean yah you ' re s standing in front of all students and
uhm you have to really give them a image 
 that ' s okay but 
 i mean they tease us nicely but
so okay 
 they don't really speak in english
okay so
so that they
oh i don't know
oh dear but oh i ' m sure it ' s got to be pretty hard
and you know my partner dorcas right
 oh 
yah
she ' s doing uhm some translations
translation
yah in chinese
 g 
for the students
oh but
like while i ' m teaching
how ' s i i mean how is that done
oh she ' s she ' s talking in cantonese 
 yeah 
 yeah 
that helps but then we can't always do that well if i ' m teaching
alone
oh okay 
 yeah 
so they won't listen to you unless they understand what you are
saying
oh
and i really need it simple three words 
you know yeah 
or they don't try to 
 uhm but i mean i i know it helps
she ' s an after all it ' s s a very different one-word
 if they want to really learn english
yeah other classes are fine it just that
 uhm 
so it ' s only that class
that ' s really annoying
yeah
but it ' s that one good thing is like you are not really
affecting your voice at all
i mean i thought teaching is somehow uh especially teaching
naughty students you know is gonna make you scold them and
 uh to shout and yell and all that but uh it doesn't seem to
affect your voice at all
 yeah 
 yeah 
uh
yah that ' s good 
 we have a mic
but but then still i mean cos it ' s kind of like angry
sometimes i think
oh yeah
i do believe it 
 yeah 
i had lost my temper today
i i oh i could have i should v visualise that you
know well that isn't really like it will i really kind of like lose my temper
just now too
yeah
cos i ' ve just really like like what the heck is going on i
just don't care whatever whatever whatever you know what i
mean laughter 
 yeah 
you will get by
yeah and s i just want i just want to get the work
done
do you have anymore
 anymore 
 work to do
well yes actually i have two uhm essays to be handed in next
week
and one of which really is not really an essay but uhm a report
 and then next monday i have to hand in another essay draft but
then that ' s that that draft is like one thousand to two two thousand words
 a report 
you have to hand in a draft
yeah
oh i never do that
oh we have to for this course i mean it just very first
course that i have to do that requires uh a uhm you know a a drafting
easy for you
yah but uhm well that ' s okay cos it ' s just s a
draft
yeah you have to do a lot of readings
 but it 
oh yes i do but then but the most of these are personal perception
and uh and how is this this stuff but uhm well that ' s okay
right
but then i still have other homework like uh for linguistics
i need to hand in uhm a proposal for se for one and a a a workshop
report for another
that ' s a lot
yeah that ' s really you know it ' s it ' s not a lot like lot
of big chunk of work but it ' s like bits and pieces everywhere
yeah
so it ' s kinda a lot of work
how about your part time job
are you still having the tutorial
oh you mean uhm my students
yeah the one in uhm oh vivien right
oh yeah i am still teaching her
yeah
still
and uh it ' s kind of disappointing cos uhm tut i really
want her to get at least a credit for her cert levels but
she just keep on saying that oh whatever i just want a pass
i just want an e one-word 
cos i just want i just want to be accepted to my
mother school for uhm matriculation and and i said oh come on you can do
better than that and 
 yeah 
 okay 
 yeah she didn't try to do even her homework
i know but well well she ' s been uhm a little bit uhm more
hard working i can say cos i i gave her a lot of assignments actually and
well we only meet once a week you know yes and so she still manages to uh
pass it i mean finish off the homework herself but them uhm of course quality
counts
yeah
yeah and
what about her friend
oh she stopped
she stopped already 
 yes she stopped
but there ' s a big problem here cos i think for the most local
school students uh uhm especially under the present hong kong education
system it ' s like all you need is to get through the minimum requirement
yeah
uh to get the minimum requirement that ' s all they want
it ' s not that they want to uhm achieve something out of the
subject
yeah
it ' s just that they are taught how to do the examinations
yeah
yeah and
right
yeah and she just telling me that she she just need to she
get a pass
she just need to get a pass
and she ' s not going to put more effort in it you know but
 what about university
yeah i ' m gonna to ask her that
i mean i mean i ' ve been you know reminding her that uh well it ' s
not that your mother ' s school has accepted you then you will be uhm you will
be justified or whatever
 yeah 
 yeah cos after all university requirements are
still pretty uhm important
did you talk to her mother
well i s did somehow and uh oh i actually had a chat
after her lesson together and uhm well and her mom ' s kind of worried cos she
understand that her daughter is not really putting too much effort in
 english
and uh and then she she only wants to be a you know
biotechnological scientist or whatever
 yeah 
to be what
 s 
biotechnological scientist
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah she only inter she ' s only interested in
biochemistry and bioinformatics
that ' s why
yeah and and she doesn't need uhm a position you
know a good standard of english or whatever
but you know when compare to other form five students she ' s
doing already you know pretty well
yeah yeah cos i have another like form four students i i have
a form four student who ' s in dgs and her english is really tut just
flawless i can say
it ' s really good 
yes she is really good and of course her chinese is brilliant as
well
she ' s reading uhm uh reading the chinese poetry and uh doing
chinese uhm literature stuff doing liter 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 you ' re you ' re not tutoring her
uhm well she needs help on economics and uh uh well actually
uh even though her english is good doesn't mean her english literature is
fine
right
she ' s she ' s now working on english literature as well
and well there is a big difference i mean difference between uhm
uhm lower band schools and you know the top schools even local schools
yeah
you know what she ' s doing for english literature
what
creative writing
wow
creative writing 
well
and i only do that in university
it ' s amazing
i mean okay fine
she ' s form four all right
and one of her assignment is to uhm describe a deserted island
describe what
a deserted island
so is that
and uh yah yah you have to really write it uhm beautiful or
something
you have to say uhm tut uhm an island is inhabited and
there ' s uhm there ' s plenty of uhm woodland and blah blah blah it ' s 
it ' s uh 
 but like very poetic 
yah that ' s that ' s uh going to get you a low mark
 right if you ' re just write it so straight forward
it ' s not geography right
it ' s uhm lit literature
 uh 
yeah
and it ' s creative writing
right
yeah and there ' s this thing uhm tut well actually
it ' s quite interesting cos uhm this is a new student of mine
and uhm she ' s been taking courses that are exactly the same as
what i had took in my like cert levels
same
exactly the same thing
so you know her standard and her style
yah and and uhm the most interesting thing is that uh uhm
well i have two words she ' s like my past a
few words because i ' ve you know i struggled a lot
through form four and my english literature too cos i couldn't really find
the right words to describe what i want to say and couldn't really be uhm
critical
 yeah 
yeah
at that moment because because it is different what you know
we did a-levels
yeah
in literature and that ' s a totally different thing to form
five level right
yeah
cos in form five you only have to be uhm kind of like
descriptive
yeah
and you only have uh your own perception and 
write well that ' s fine
but in a-level you ' ll have to uhm tut 
 yeah 
give more of your opinion
yah and you have to be very critical at
 and more 
exactly
exactly so i think it ' s only form six and seven that i kind
of like got the g the i mean the idea of how to write a good english
literature paper
whereas in form five i was just you know write fancy stuff which
is not really it
so can you teach her
well yah well she ' s kind of i don't know cos uhm uhm she
asked me to describe a waterfall yesterday
uhm
and uhm she couldn't really find the right words to describe
a waterfall so i suggested you know uhm to write it through metaphors and uhm
personification may be
yeah
yeah and that makes a big difference
you know celle was teaching uh primary two and three students
uh huh
using uh that personification
uh huh
and then that girl was so good with her
father teaches her literature right
 oh 
yeah
and then she wanted somebody else to uhm
teach her
practice
oral
uhm yeah
no not oral but
writing
yah and reading
 wow 
 and reading 
uh that ' s good
she she couldn't believe that she was reading all that kind
of literature stuff
oh that ' s good
yah she ' s primary two
 it ' s pretty good 
that ' s pretty good
yah so i think if you start younger and
yeah that makes a bit difference
<$b
yah
and that girl can write poems you see
yeah uhm you know what i find uhm it ' s really
the simplest word i mean the simplest words are good
i mean it will be really amazed to find these every simple words
 and 
yeah
which can really give you the energy and power and some lines
yeah
yeah it ' s uhm i ' ve d uhm have gone through a poem
sometime ago like the words are just really really simple just primary
student words
yeah
and uhm uh but then the sen i mean the sensation
that you got from it is so evoking
uhm
that so kind of a provocative even
yeah it ' s it ' s these are i i mean i think that ' s what you meant
like even it ' s just primary two student cos uhm her vocabulary bank is not
as uhm as vast as ours right i think well well uh of course it ' s natural to
say that but then she ' s selects her words really carefully
yah
yeah
and that ' s how she creates her you know creates for all
these kind of big words in the poem
that ' s nice
yeah
that ' s nice it ' s it is really good
oh yeah
uhm uhm 
 oh yeah but two words 
well now
yeah
well yeah i ' m teaching her two subjects oh my gosh
yeah
i ' m teaching her i ' m teaching her economics french and
english literature
you have time
well well actually uh i just go twice a week and two hours
every session so well i ' ll squeeze out some time for her still it ' s fine
that uhm tut i think that uhm it ' s better to have uhm a
few students that uh more time on them rather than you have a lot students
which is one or two hours each 
 i only have one student i can't even go every
week
oh i think you ' re cos you ' re you are a teacher already
