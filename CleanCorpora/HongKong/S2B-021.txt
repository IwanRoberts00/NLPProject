the chairman of the united states federal communications
commission recently said there are thousands of buildings in america with
millions of people in them who have no telephones no cable television and no
reasonable prospect of broad brand services 
they are called schools 
even in the most technically advanced country in the world there can
be shortfalls in high-tech vision
how do we stand in hong kong
in the past individuals or governments could afford to wait for new
development analyze it assess it and take appropriate action 
not anymore 
today things change so quickly that people or authorities without
vision will be taken unawares and left behind and it's getting worse 
look at the mistakes i have met since i have been in legco 
the government signed a contract for international telephone traffic
for twenty-five years against the advice of their engineers at the time
now they are in a terrible mess and according to the policy
commitment trying to re-negotiate the terms
good luck to them 
only about a year ago the police raided several internet providers
 without the faintest idea what they were doing technologically cutting
several hundred subscribers off the net until and interrupting essential
business
the constitutional affair branch paid over two and a half million
dollars to a consultant to look into computerizing the voting in hong kong
the consultant apparently got away with errors in excess of hundred
sixty million dollars in his estimates rendering the consultancy virtually
useless
the reason as fa as far as i can gather lay in the terms
of reference he was given 
transport branch allow tunnel companies to install incompatible
auto toll systems greatly inhibiting the extension of the scheme
security branch allow the various emergency services to purchase
incompatible communication equipment greatly inhibiting the rescue operation
in the pak sin range fir hill fire disaster 
in nineteen ninety-two education branch adopted a commitment to
provide a computer for every secondary student studying information
technology
i hope this was not just a one-time investment in computers with
not enough follow-up fundings to maintain and upgrade them buy software and
make the necessary changes to teaching methods
in any case today it is not enough 
if you are twenty-five today and not comfortable with computers you
risk being ineffective in almost any kind of work you pursue 
so what about all those students who are not studying information
technology 
police branches concerned with information have failed to reach a
definitive conclusion on extent to which information channels are common
carriers without responsibility for their content or publishers who complete
and in the case of internet and video on demand quite unrealistic
responsibility 
as a result policy is uncertain and unstable
recently planning branch concluded a survey on shopping habits just
before shopping on internet becomes established and changes it all
in some of these cases government are taking belated action to try
and rectify the shortcomings
in future that won't do
then they will never catch up with reality
so let's have a look at some of the developments our policy
branches should be looking at
take education
with the astronomical increase in information it's no longer viable
to base education on the teaching effects 
instead education branch should be focusing on teaching problem
solving 
trade and industry should be well advanced on regulating business
on the internet
the housing authority should be updating housing design to
accommodate people who may be required to work at home or in communal working
facilities on the estates so called tele-workers
planning branch should be considering the implications of the
defocusing of national boundaries caused by developing communications
technology 
culture branch should be analyzing the likely effect of our
becoming part of a global community with an international cultural superstructure
should we be taking action to protect our asian culture 
finance branch should be taking into account the existence of tax
calculations in data form held by almost all companies and many invi 
individuals to supersede the complex and time-consuming forms they all have
to fill in irrespective of whether they are computerized or not 
economic services should be examining the extent to which universal
service should be provided for the public beyond the few basic utilities so
governed today 
should cable tv or broad brand internet be equally available to all
this branch should also be co cooperating with
broadcasting and planning branches to resolve the conflict between common
carriers and publishing
what is needed is a rating standard that can be adopted or not by
providers with pc software that can block material not rated 
this would overcome most of the licensing dilemma
works branch and probably others should be pursuing tendering
on-line to optimize international bidding
security branch should be promoting public cryptography 
and making optimum use of cheap video data recording in the
prevention of crime
constitutional affair branch should be studying the political
effect of readily available inexpensive referenda at the command of any
legislator and be deciding on the dividing line between reasonable direct
consultation of the people and full-blown direct
public intervention of virtually every legislative process 
all the developments i have just referred to will come to pass 
during the term of office of sar chief executive-elect mr tung chee hwa 
thank goodness he was trained as an engineer and will appreciate the
impact of technology on his administration 
now perhaps for the first time our government will have an
opportunity to come to grips with high technology 
i hope they will create the necessary think-tanks and support
groups to back up the legislative bodies which have been convened so lacking
in high-tech expertise and comprehension 
much of what i have said is reflected in bill gates ' book the road
ahead 
i recommend it to anyone who seeks access to enthusiastic high-tech
vision
after all he didn't get to the chairman and chief executive of
microsoft and the richest man in the world at the age of forty-one by getting
it wrong
furthermore he ' s clearly backed by the hundred
million subscribers to the network of information and thought that is the
greatest single influence in our society today
let not hong kong with its tremendous reputation for being in the
forefront of new ideas lose that place in the world and fall behind 
last tuesday the secretary for recreation and culture brian
chau announced the shelving of an onerous broadcasting bill that
his branch has been drafting since nineteen ninety-two
the media were quick to interpret this year's 1-word
 to the so-called china factor though this was vigorously denied by
mr chau the governor and china 
ching so the outgoing secretary had pledged in september nineteen
ninety-five that the bill would be ready by early nineteen ninety-six 
in october the government published a policy commitment to produce
this comprehensive legislation and i quote to make the regulatory framework
more user-friendly and adaptable to rapid changes in technology 
previously michael leung acting as chief secretary in may nineteen
ninety-five had said categorically that the government had not shelved this
piece of legislation 
he said this two days after a reported statement by acting
recreation and culture secretary fred ting saying it had been shelved because
it was a half-baked chestnut cake which was likely to be delayed by china 
as i remember it what fred ting actually said was that the bill
drafter had been unable to keep up with technology which was so fast-moving
and so complex the bill has become a half-baked chestnut cake 
he thought the transfer of sovereignty would be upon us before
it could be enacted 
the politicians however in their haste to latch onto the china
factor neglected the real reason which does have very little publicity 
brian chau has now confirmed that it is being shelved because he
said there are higher-priority matters such as video on demand pay tv 
and the three-day-old consumer council report 
reading between the lines government had set themselves a hopeless
task of producing highly complex legislation within a disorganized
administrative system when profound understanding and clear leadership of a
dynamic technology was absolutely essential for progress 
for the past year they have been trying to climb out of this
embarrassment and brian chau has finally found a way 
how did government get into this mess 
by drifting into a regulatory framework wrapped around a technology
they did not understand 
this resulted in a catastrophic split of earthquake proportions in
the government policy structure 
telecommunications was handled by one secretary and broadcasting
technology by another both subordinate to different seniors the only formal
link between them being through the governor himself
inevitably the structure failed with every advance in the
technology 
it failed when star tv could not be licensed under the tv ordinance
 and had to be lobbed over to the other secretary under the
telecommunications ordinance completely inappropriately 
the result is a wide divergence between licensing condition for
satellite and cable tv 
it failed from the moment video on demand was revealed to the
public in february nineteen ninety-four giving government over two years to
establish the policy and regulations 
so completely have they failed they are now having to drop
everything to get their affairs into some sort of shape before the technology
becomes available to the public in july 
it has resulted in inequitable royalties between cable and
traditional tv operators in inequitable consumer pricing structure
between telephones and cable tv outlet inconsistencies in media ownership
rules anti-competitive practices and unnecessary costs to subscribers 
all the time the technology has spread faster than administration-led
law drafters can draft laws 
brian chau had said that there will be no great harm in leaving the
bill till after the handover when the sar government can pick it up where the
hong kong government has left off 
absolutely categorically and unconditionally wrong 
by then the technology will have advanced so much further that the
present draft won't be worth the disk it is written on 
the mess can be traced back to a misunderstanding of the
broadcasting policy in the first place 
various secretaries of recreation and culture wallowed in fine words
like educating informing entertaining providing a broad spectrum of views and
so on without looking through the telescope in the direction the technology
was pointing 
they had become immersed in regulating and supplementing the
programming of commercial broadcaster whose main short-term concern was to
find a success formula and stick to it
technology however was telling us that by the end of this century
 broadcasting as we know it will not exist 
we will be in an era of multifarious and unscheduled choice 
the policy and a regulatory framework for that would take internet
in his stride 
much of this is contained or touch on in the recent consumer
council report on broadcasting an excellent document which benefitted from a
highly professional steering group 
its principle recommendation is that a new policy secretary should
be established responsible for broadcasting telecommunication and
communication technologies with a highly professional staff 
this would be a technological branch like the highly successful
works branch 
when this suggestion was put to a senior government official a week
ago he said there was no need for such a branch 
the secretary for recreation and culture could handle all the
relevant issues 
he instantly dismissed a highly professional report with a casual
gesture by indicating that a policy framework which has failed miserably in the
past and had now reached a point of public scandal should continue unchanged
in concept 
he implied an an administrator with broad experience in say human
resources housing constitutional affairs and industry can adapt to the
intricacy of cyberspace policy overnight 
furthermore by putting telecoms under the secretary for recreation
and culture this particular senior government official would regard the
telephone on every senior executive's desk including his own as either
recreation or culture 
when it comes to high technology i would like to see less snap
ill-considered comments by administrator and more well-considered decision by professional 
four years ago we set up a properly constituted office of the
telecommunications authority headed by the professional <,
as a result telecommunications in hong kong has made tremendous
progress 
in a same period the whole issue of broadcasting has foundered 
the administrators have simply been unable to pick it up 
it is now an enormous public scandal in which the traditional
nineteenth-century admin offices system has shown itself totally inadequate
to grasp today's technological and cultural revolution 
you simply can't jump from controlling hawkers one day to dealing
with high technology the next 
brian chau has said his branch will need six months to assess and
respond to the consumer council report 
they probably will need six months 
a team of expert in broadcasting and related technology could
probably do it in two weeks 
i strongly recommend that he wastes no more precious time
he should proceed tomorrow to establish and recruit the
professional staff that the consumer council regards as absolutely essential
in which they have my full support to get broadcasting in hong kong back on
the rails 
he should consider co-opting professionals immediately to assist
in unravelling the tangle his branch must be in 
he has shown himself to be different from the normal
i-am-always-right spokesman 
perhaps he is the one man who can create order out of the chaos
