<I>
okay uhm the background for me to undertake uhm this
research is related to perhaps that uhm
i ' m a member of the institute network and pacific asia
so every year they organize a conference on a specific theme
so uh this year they had a conference on cultural economy
so uhm in hong kong uh uh yes hong kong essence uhm in 
in sort of you know
two set which are related to cultural economy
one is the film industry or the movie industry
the other is probably tourism
uhm since i don't really have a lot of connection with the black
society the underground world
so i think i like i probably cannot do too much
research in the movie industry
and that ' s why i choose uhm you know tourism uhm to be my uhm
target uhm you know uhm research area
and and then at that time uhm when i look at uhm tourism uh
promoting and tourism development
uh two of my uh msc students are working on two case studies which
are related to uhm commoditifing culture
you know which is related to tai o
trying to commercialize package tai o to attract more
tourists
and the other is working on uhm the cultural district where is
 the artist village
uhm uhm you know taste which i think it ' s in a way trying
to culturalize something you know uhm some commodities in order to
uh make hong kong look you know better and be a city of life as 
applicated by the tourists uhm tourists abroad
uhm so when i look at tourism promotion and then try to tie
these two case studies together
you know i sort of try to make the case that uhm
it ' s actually quite difficult for tourism uhm to sell sort of
hong kong ' s culture uhm in promoting tourism
basically because uhm the government has a very net and
very one-word world wrong attitude in heritage
conservation
and it ' s always emphasizing on building hardware hardware
rather than uh nurturing a culture com community with local
characters
so uh so that ' s why i started you know this little paper
uh when simon try to ask us to do presentations
well you know i i thought well maybe i can sort of do a little
presentation on it
anyway that ' s what i want start of uhm to discuss in this 
presentation
first i ' ll talk about uhm you know the hong kong story in terms of
hong kong economic development and culture
uhm focusing on you know uhm three uhm major areas
one is colonialism and local culture
uhm then capitalism and modern culture and then you know 
one-word is global turn you know
people call it you know is is a cultural turn of uhm capitalism
uh that we are seeing you know in in the process of globalization
i want to talk a little bit about economic restructuring and the
 commodification of culture
and then uhm i move on to talk about the culture scene in hong kong
and look at uhm you know quite interestingly you know tourism
promotion uhm in the pre and pro asian financial crisis
and basically we can see that before the asian financial crisis
when people talk about tourism
they talk a lot about uhm you know infrastructure building
you know providing better hardware whereas after you know uhm the
crisis uhm
they emphasize more on uhm culture areas
and then i ' ll proceed to look at the two case studies
the first one is uhm the tai o fishing village
and the other one is uh basically the artist village
and then i ' ll move on to analysis and policy implications uh
briefly 
uhm a long pause 
another of uhm literature uhm try to talk about how colonialism
has influenced uhm cultural development
and here you know this one uhm from kane uhm his work on
urban is on colonialism and the world economy
and i try to sort of you know uh identify the key characters
that characteristics that uhm he mention
i see if it really you know a theme they really apply to hong kong
uhm the red one sort of try to say that okay you know maybe
that ' s true
and and the blue one i don't think they are applicable
uhm now basically you know uhm that a lot of uhm scholars argue
that pluralistic uh economy can be found uh in the in the colony
that ' s not quite true in hong kong
especially uhm in the post seventies
uhm and then present of large group of indigenous uh unskilled and
semi-skilled migrated workers
uhm true to a certain extend but immigration of chinese
mainlanders to hong kong has been tightly controlled
uhm so that ' s you know that ' s a little bit different from other
places
 one-word spending favouring colonial elite
i i ' ll argue yes uhm subject to debate and counter argument
dominant of church respective like colonial ages
hobbies yes until this uhm you know churchy set their interest you
know uhm until the seventies 
and and parasitic relation will invidious rural set that ' s not
applicable at all in hong kong as we are very urbanized basically
uhm indigenous rural credit nation nationalist elite
yes
in direct rule uhm an that ' s quite true
but basically true and competitive lack talk down government
but a lot of the social and cultural dimension uhm do not really
apply to the case in the case of hong kong
uhm uhm like class like nature urban society
i don't think you know we count that occupational 
one-word by ethnic groups
no
 one-word institutional uhm you know structure
basically no
uhm residential separation by race
uh yes we do have that by class but probably not by race
but anyway uh what i want 
you know i try to see is like
you know to what extend our culture is being influenced by uhm the
fact that uhm you know we were a colony
you know for hundred or so you know years
and i would try to si you know argue that uhm you know
unlike other places where you know to quote from a home
and he say the british colonizers had no interest in learning from
other long established urban cultures
and sometimes one-word a violent physical
assort on uh such cultures
just defining their actions by one-word uh
concern with issues of defence and public wealth
uhm uh yes we don't really have that uhm you know
and and also you know uhm in fact a a kind to uhm some of
the uhm information that i can gather from people who work in hong kong
uh basically you know they came to hong kong
uh i mean in the government uh
because they they admire chinese culture
so they really you know some of them you know not probably not all
of them
but they came here because they would like to learn more about
chinese culture
they have this admiration
uh but then when they come to hong kong
you know because of that it doesn't mean that they are
interested in the local culture
cause hong kong has its own very unique local culture
uhm uhm which you know it ' s a mixture of east and west high
and low culture
you know uhm you know elegant elements et cetera elements if you
like traditional and modern
uhm but then it ' s local culture 
uhm i would argue you know has born by neglect
you know basically you know little sort of uhm this kind of
culture
uhm it ' s not really uhm taking very seriously uhm by by the
important people you know
uhm when i tell you define it as
and it ' s uh very unique and rich local culture has survived uh in
between uh very you know highly money and one-word 
orientated
you know and and economics uh you know dreams and society you know
which
uhm you know bring that to the argument that okay you know so how
colonialism but colonialism
unlike other colonies uhm you know does not leave you
know a familiar kind of influence physical influence in a city
with we still retain very rich local culture but this rich local
culture is not really apps appreciated
you know uhm you know in the process
uhm and also you know this local culture actually is being
squeezed you know in between uh capitalism
capitalistic kind of culture which which you know you can call
it modern cultural you know and economics identify modernization with
industrialization with urbanization which actually are common to some people
it ' s actually at in one-word uhm conception
of culture
uhm modern culture as a stylization applied you know like
 have a taste you know
i don't know you know how you would uh uh you know define
taste
but basically uhm you know it ' s about uhm 
i don't know living in bigger houses uh good life appearance
richness you know rather than you know moral values uhm et cetera
uhm like ray one-word say you know
individuals in a capitalistic culture
a position as consumers rather than citizens moral and political
issues are displaced by market position like calling to self interest
and the public rule root is definitely 
you know uhm one-word 
so basically that so that ' s another side of our culture
we don't have local indigenous you know culture growing by
neglect in habits
we do have some colonial influence but not too much accord
 to you know uhm to the table that we ' ve just seen
and uh we we are squeezing between its capitalistic culture which
identified with with modernity modernization you know urbanization
industrialization
but then uh well we all know the story in hong kong is that uhm
after the asian financial crisis
uhm we are facing this problem of 
okay economic restructuring intensified
you know in a way that uhm you know we like other you know places
we need to diversify we recognize that we need to diversify our
economy
and we also take the culture turn you know
we try to commodifiy uhm you know culture
but basically uh we try to commodify culture in order 
to help us to sort of struggle through this very difficult economic period
rather than having one word that ' s my my argument you
know uhm uhm
rather than really having a general interest in nurturing
you know uhm the kind of uhm culture uh that you know we are
having
and i try to argue uh you know that in the two case
studies that i ' m going to talk about
but before we talk about the case studies
let ' s let ' s look at the cultural uhm scene in hong kong 
i would argue that actually we do have you know 
one-word amount of one-word cultural wealth
the problem is it ' s wealth is not being sort of you know
uhm valued and developed and stored
and i don't know package 
uhm because of uh policy one-word 
uhm like we do have seven thousand pre ninety fifty
buildings according to professor long 
but only sixty nine are declared monument
well you know that ' s fair enough
because you know most of those buildings may not reserved you
know monumental status
but according to long and one-word you know
they try to argue that uhm 
the antiquity and monument uhm argument is weak
there ' s a lack of communication and cooperation among government
departments
and there ' s a lack of support from the general public
uh you know uh for heritage conservation
uh and and you know and more than that i ' ll talk more about that
you know in a minute
so so government you know uhm does not really have uh sort of
an integrated policy uhm to really promote our culture uhm development
uhm and then the other you know thing is that uhm
in hong kong high cultures is always quite remote from the
majority of the population
you know when i say high culture i you know i ' m concert
opera
you know these kind of things really quite alienated uh from the
general uh public
because according to the survey of public uhm attitude
a survey of facilities uses conducted by the one-word
 department between mid nineteen ninety eight and early nineteen
ninety nine
the level of participation in cultural activities was low
with less than twenty percent of those respondents
right that they had participated in cultural activities in
nineteen ninety seven
and most of them are young professionals with high educational 
attainment 
so you know high cultural actually not a something quite
remote from the general uhm public
another thing which uhm you know is third quite typical
of hong kong is that uhm 
all the institutional set up uhm you know one-word
 related to cultural development
they plays a lot of emphasis on the hardware
you know a better building better facilities rather than you know
the people the quality of the people the human resources
uh i ' m not going to bore you know bored you with all
these details
but anyway uhm uhm that you know that is what a lot of uhm
uhm the artists in the field have uhm sort of complaint
