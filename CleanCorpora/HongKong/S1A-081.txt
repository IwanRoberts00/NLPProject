excellent here yeah 
 laughs yeah 
 uhm 
i think it ' s sometime i think it ' s really too busy in
hong kong
 people just don't have much time to to stay at
home and communicate with their parents and their brothers and sisters
so there are all kinds of family problems in hong kong
 
 yeah 
yeah yeah yeah
especially for those who are poor and low uh
social economic status 
yeah 
 yes 
 uhm uhm 
uh do you like shopping in hong kong

well 
 well 
 it ' s okay
but it ' s okay
yeah
 
yeah it ' s okay uh and and you are lucky
because there are lots of uhm products of hello 
kitty nowadays yeah yeah
but i i prefer uhm animals without the brand 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 oh 
 uhm uhm uhm i see 
so uhm are you studying for your examination right now or
 
uhm i ' m not
i ' m preparing my dissertation 
yeah something like a final year project yeah
 
 dissertation 
 oh 
 
uhm uhm 
when do you have to hand in your dissertation
 
well the fi final draft would be uh on the thirty first
of my uh may 
yeah so it ' s quite in a hurry 
 uhm uhm uhm 
do do you have an examination then
 
 well uh
we do not have examination in this semester
yeah we had one in the first semester
 yeah and uh usually in the faculty of education
we uh only have to submit our assignment and our
project
and uh we have to go to school to have a teaching practice
yeah and the lecturer would come to supervise you
and things like that yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
maybe i i think life in education student is very busy
they ' re mos most of them are very busy
 
really 
yes all speakers laugh and those
you don't think so
and they are very busy
 
well when i was in year one and year two i don't think it was
too busy 
yeah but uh in year three and year four uh yeah quite busy
especially when you have to go to the teaching practice
 yeah you have to teach there
 uh ha you have to prepare teaching material and
uh prepare uh when the supervisor come to see you
you have to prepare a show
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
yeah
 
 uh 
 actually uh my secondary schoolmates are
studying education 
uhm but year three
 i don't know whether you know her or not
uh joanne do you know one-word 
 
 really 
 uh ha 
 no 
uhm she have to uh go to teaching practice 
uhm i think a month or two months ago 
and they they are not and they they do not enjoy 
 it actually
 and because uhm tut the secondary school
that uh she allocated to is band five
a band four or band five school
 so the student is very bad and they just
uhm they always fight in the in the classroom
 or and it ' s really how to say
uhm people injured actually 
and she think that it is very very
terrible 
so uhm it make her don't really like to be uhm
 
 yeah 
 two months yeah 
 yes yes 
 
 uh really 
 why 
 oh 
 oh 
 in the classroom 
 oh 
 really oh 
 so terrible 
 
 oh 
 teacher anymore 
 i think 
uhm uhm no teacher uh but band four or band five 
 teacher
maybe band one or two or three is okay for her 
 and
 laughs 
 
 yeah 
uh ha
because uh she she told me that uhm the teacher uhm tut
 in those school actually have some kind of background uh 
really uh then they uh if they without uh those uh
maybe triad background
they can't communicate with the student and the student won't uhm
afraid of them
 and so she think that it ' s too com 
complicated for her
 
 really 
 oh 
oh wow i can't image because uhm in these years
i have been allocated to some band one schools 
only 
 so 
 oh 
 
yeah all speakers laugh 
so you ' re very lucky
 
yeah yeah yeah
and the students they are hardworking
 they are nice yeah
they like to talk to teacher yeah 
they treat you as friends yeah 
 uhm 
 so 
you you you enjoy teaching very much then
 
yeah of course all speakers laugh 
because the the students are very good actually yeah 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm
but uh have you find uhm the secondary school
that you will g you are going to teach
 
yeah yeah yeah
i ' ve got a job already
uh but uh i don't know which one
uh i just know it ' s going to be a government school 
yeah they allocate you they uh
the government says they uhm they have hard you
and later on they will allocate you to a school
 i still do not know which school i ' m going to
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
uhm all the student uh in your department allocated 
si school by the government or 
 
 no no no
uh you have to apply for the post and they 
 interview you
and only uh i i was the only lucky one yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 oh 
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
 your your uhm academic result is very
outstanding all speakers laugh 
 
no i think my interview was a bit better 
 oh have you
 
 yeah 
uhm do you do you regard yourself as uhm a foreigner or hong
kong people or something like that
 
as a foreigner i think 
 you you regard yourself as a foreigner
 
 yeah yeah 
but you have been lived in hong kong so many years
so maybe some foreigner will think that oh i ' m hong kong people
maybe
 
oh it was it ' s interesting when i was in secondary school
because i was in a a local school
 all my friends are chinese and yeah and i keep on
talking to them in chinese
so uhm at that time i regarded myself a little bit like a 
a chinese or a common hong kong person
but uh since i have been in hong kong u uh things have changed
i don't know why
uhm maybe because i have been going to some other countries to
stay there for uh during the summer vacation 
uh ha and or maybe because i ' m studying something that i like
more
and i i got more contact with the english culture
yeah so i i think i ' ve started regard myself more as a foreigner
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 because uh when when we are looking at you
we think that you are foreigner all speakers laugh 
 
actually i am 
yeah actually you are 
uh do you think that uhm hong kong people are are friendly or
uhm
do you like hong kong people
 
 yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah
friendly yeah
i agree with it 
uh you have been to several countries 
so uh which countries you like the best
 
 uh ha uh ha 
switzerland 
switzerland
 
yeah 
 yes 
because the scenery is very good
 
 yeah 
and the people over there they are just nice
uh i remember once uhm 
actually we didn't got lost
we just uhm uh came off from the bus and we were looking for the
youth hostel
 alright looking around uh ha
and uh an old man saw us looking around
and he came and approach us and he ask uh are you looking for the
youth hostel
you know we don't ask any question
we just looking around and he came to ask you and
he show us the way
 yeah it was impressive and uh
in switzerland yeah uh people uh in the bus
they would uh tell you uh you ' ve got two more stations to get
off
yeah or they would ask ask you are you a
foreigner are you tourist things like that
they are very nice and keep on talking to you and uh promoting
their country to you 
 and
 laugh 
yeah and clean i think 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 oh 
 uhm 
i think in hong kong people uhm not are are not as friendly as
switzerland
not because their nature but because they are very busy 
actually 
maybe uhm some people want to help you
but when they uhm see the watch
oh i ' m in hurry
 i ' m i ' m sorry i can't help you
but uh i actually want to help you but i just got no time
something like that
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
yeah i agree with you
and maybe uhm i think uh people in hong kong are being
trained to protect themselves quite a lot 
yeah yeah yeah
uh don't talk to strangers
 uh especially girls uh uh otherwise 
 and
 laugh you ' ll yeah
you ' ll be in trouble yeah 
 yes 
 yeah 
yeah
uh even now i ' m always warned by my parents not to talk to
stranger 
 laughs in the street
and if someone approach you don't don't uh don't talk to them
you just neg neglect them
 
yeah yeah yeah 
because uh i think it ' s because of the traditional chinese
value is rather protective
 
yeah yeah yeah
and the government is teaching people not to uh give money to the
beggars
 so yeah 
sometimes i used to give money to them but nowadays i i think
well i have to uh stop myself yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
but actually some beggar are are
they hired
 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah 
but uhm i know that uhm many of them actually is a kind of uh
crime group
can i say that 
 yes 
 
 yeah yeah yeah 
so uhm i i i would i will watch them closely
or uhm watch them for a while before i really give them money 
 
i i want to make sure if i ' m helping them or just uhm
encourage a crime
 uhm uhm 
 
yeah yeah yeah
that ' s what i ' m thinking as well 
 and
 laugh 
so i think it ' s ver very strange
because i i just want to do something good
but turn out maybe i ' m i just i ' m not helping them
but i i maybe i ' m doing some kind of bad thing
 or maybe i ' m participate in a crime
 so the feeling is not very good
 
 yeah 
 uhm 
yeah yeah yeah uhm 
 that way
so
well would would you be staying in hong kong to continue to
 ac to work as a teacher
 
yeah because i ' ve got a job already 
 and
 laugh 
and well i don't knowing the future 
 maybe uh for the mean time ten or twenty years yeah 
but uh no well i ' ll i ' ll
actually i ' ve got a plan
i want to work for around three or four years and then i want to
further my studies in uh in either uk or in uh usa 
yeah 
and then maybe i come back to hong kong to work yeah
and maybe in the future i i would like to go to europe to live
actually yeah
but it depends on my uhm husband uh one-word 
 and
 laugh 
yeah my future husband likely
yeah 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm 
 uhm 
do do you have a a a a candidate for your future husband
 
yeah of course all speakers laugh 
 yeah 
 is uh is he a chinese or 
 
 yeah he ' s chinese
 
 oh 
 he ' s chinese
uhm uhm
uh also student of university of hong kong or
 
no he graduated already
 because i ' m in year four so
 yeah yeah 
 oh 
 oh i see
 so you you uhm
do you think uh your your relationship is very good or
 how how can you describe your relationship then
 oh yeah 
 
 yeah 
how can i describe 
very very good friend good friends yeah
support each other
what else well caring 
 laughs 
 uhm 
 very very 
he is working right now
 
yeah he ' s a teacher as well 
 oh 
 oh 
 
 uhm uhm 
he ' s student of education department also
 
no no no
he ' s study economics here 
oh i study economics too
 
really 
 yes 
 yeah 
 laughs 
 
yeah so 
then how do you know each other
in the university or outside the university 
 
 in the university
uh by organizing activities 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
 yeah 
have you ever heard about the sports association 
yes
 
yeah yeah yeah
so i was a member of the sports association for two years
 and in the second year uh he i knew him yeah 
 uhm 
yeah
 
yeah 
sounds very romantic
uh all speakers laugh 
 
yeah a bit romantic
because uh have you ever watch that film from uh leon lai and
 a long pause one-word uh well uh the girl
was in lady ho tung hall
and i was in lady ho tung hall before
 and he was uh le 
leon was in ricci and my boyfriend uh wa was a boy from
ricci as well all speakers laugh 
 uhm uhm 
oh
so you you you have uh special feeling when you watch 
that film 
 
 yeah 
 and
 laugh a bit
yeah 
uhm
uh do you like watching movie uhm when you have time in
the leisure
 
yeah uh but i prefer reading books 
 oh 
 
 yeah 
uhm do you like uh of hong kong movie or uh 
 overseas movie
 
 no 
yeah i think the western ones
yeah the hong kong one uh tut a bit too common you know
 yeah the yeah
it seems that they are producing movies just for the sake of
producing them
yeah not uh yeah 
 yes 
because uhm uh when i have time
uhm i like to watch western movie also
because i think hong kong uh after i ' ve watched the hong kong
movie
uh i would think that i ' m so stupid one-word 
i have waste so many money to 
 to buy a ticket for that 
so it ' s not good 
 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 
 yeah yeah 
 i think the korean one and the japanese
movies are also very good
 
yeah 
but sometimes uhm whereas sometimes i think the japanese
movies some some of them are it are very difficult to
you you ' re you fi find very difficult to catch their
meaning all speakers laugh 
just like the film of wohng ga waih 
cantonese=a-hong-kong-film-director i always 
one-word understand what he ' s talking about
what what message is he communicating with the audience
 i don't understand his movies
 
 oh 
 yeah 
yeah i think uhm maybe the cultural differences make us uh
difficult to understand the movies 
yeah
maybe
 
yeah some people
i have got friend she ' s studying pop uh popular culture of hong
kong 
and they have to study uh lots of films uh produce a long
pause 
uh catch uh the popular culture of hong kong
 and he ' s trying to uh produce or or to
yeah integrate the popular culture of hong kong in his films
but whereas we can't understand 
 laughs 
it seems that we do not live in hong kong one-word
but those film critics they would appreciate his film 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yes yes 
 
 yeah 
yeah
actually i i don't know why one word 
 and
 laugh 
maybe we are too superficial for that
 
yeah 
 laughs yeah maybe 
so do you want to know anything about us
 
yeah uhm you ' re studying economics 
yes year three students
 
 yeah 
you are one-word year three already 
yes
oh i look very old all speakers laugh 
yes because the students even the
well the sometimes the career department will eat invite
some companies to come here 
and some of them some of the people from the from the
companies from the outside companies always think
oh they think that i am a tutor and not 
yes because i ' m really
i know my outlook really not look very young
 
 uh ha 
 really 
 laughs 
no not not old but mature
yes mature all speakers laugh 
 oh my my classmates always si say that i i ' m
look very mature
 mature 
yeah
 
i think if you change your hairstyle you look
extremely different 
 uhm 
yeah i want to change but 
 
 why don't you make it curl and short yeah
 
 yes i want i want to do so
 but it costs about a few hundred dollars
 
 yeah 
yeah one-word but before you uhm go to have
some interviews
 i think you better change your 
 appearance
because it determines a lot
 when i was having the interview uh of the
education department
uh my classmate said that i that day i look ex 
extremely smart
because i prepare for few hours 
 and
 laugh only to get a short interview yeah
and they say that uh it seems that i was going to interview them
 
those uh uh officers not they interview me yeah
i think uh during the interview the outlook and your confidence
 uh is very important
 so are you looking for jobs now 
 yes 
 yes 
 i think so 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 oh 
 uhm 
 yes 
yes because i i only start looking for job yesterday all
speakers laugh 
oh it ' s the one-word all speakers
laugh 
 two-words, etc terrible 
two-words 
 because i
well because before i don't have much time
and i don't know why i am going to do in the future 
yes i know that i know that i always say that i will be
a housewife after a few years
 but now
 
 uh ha uh ha ha 
 oh 
her dream
yes i two-words but no candidate yet 
all speakers laugh 
uh i always think that oh hsbc use five years to train a graduate
to be a a an a manager
so i it it always it also take me five years to
become a good housewife 
 laughs 
so but i know in the near future i have determine to be an
accountant
so uh i ' m i ' m looking for auditing firm jobs and
accounting firm jobs
but because my degree is not in accounting
 that ' s cause much difficulty for me
so i have to started i have to start over
and the career centre said oh you better send some letter to
the accounting firm to see whether they need any people
they need any new candidates 
so tut but it ' s okay
i have confidence i have confidence
 oh 
 oh ha 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha uh ha 
 
great 
uh ha
 
uhm last year my boyfriend uhm
he send letters to any firms that are available 
actually yeah 
yeah and and according to him uh he doesn't trust the career
centre too much now
because uhm his friend and him didn't get jobs through the career
 centre yeah
and well it ' s only for the best students
 career centre yes and best students
 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 and and most of them hold several offers
five offers or six offers
so many students many fairest students cannot get the job
offers
 
 yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
and i think i won't uhm find my job through the career centre
because i think i i totally agree with you that uhm only the top
student can get the offer 
and uhm i have uh attend to the career talk
uhm i ' ve i i think in the first semester
it ' s uh management trainee of uh i i can't remember what bank
and all of my classmate uh send application letter to 
 the bank
but uhm actually uh we haven't got the chance of the first
interview 
because maybe because uh i ' m a ba student
do you know uh arts student
and we we know that all the uh candidate shortlisted by
the bank is uh from bba or something like ec econ or financial
it ' s not it ' s not uh for us actually
 so tut it ' s uhm i think they are lying
because they said it is uh the post is for all
discipline 
so it ' s it ' s quite
i think it ' s quite difficult for the art student to get uh to
find a job related to the business 
uhm actually secondary school my uh my teacher
uh when when they told us how to choose your uh future subject in
university
don't think of your future career as it it is and not it is
there is no relationship between them
uh just uh choose what you you are interested in
but i think it ' s a lie too
 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 oh 
 all discipline 
 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
uh ha uh ha 
 yes 
 yeah 
 yes 
because i have not choose accounting when i 
enter the university
otherwise i i may studying professional accounting in cu
 and and i have to 
 laughs i don't have to take ten more papers
 now i have to take ten more papers
 
 uh ha uh 
 uh ha ha 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 how long would it take for ten more
paper 
 well just just as i ' ve have mention
it normally it take three to four years to complete four
altogether fourteen papers 
but i know a friend and she have completed the fourteen
papers in one and a half year
 oh 
 
wow she must be extremely smart 
 laughs 
yes she always study in the office after
the office hour
 yes 
 oh 
 oh 
 oh 1 24
