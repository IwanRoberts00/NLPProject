members of the jury it ' s now for me to sum up the this case to you  this means that i will tell you what is the law to be applied to this case and draw your attention to some salient features of the evidence which i hope it may assist you in your deliberation  it is a sad case  all cases involving death are  and you will keep out from your mind any prejudice or sympathy  you will not allow your emotion to influence your decision  each of you have taken oath to try this case and return a verdict according to the evidence  the time has now come for all of you to honour your obligation  the evidence in the context of this case is all the testimony given in the witness box the admitted facts the exhibits and witnesses who are not called to testify in the witness box but whose statements were read out to you as a result of agreement between the prosecution and the defence such as the statement of dr li william chai the forensic pathologist and superintendent keenan who conducted the two identification parades  anything else is not evidence  and you will completely disregard matters which might have come to your knowledge outside this courtroom or through the news media  you have just heard speeches from mr young for the prosecution  mr nguyen for the defence  you will give very careful considerations to what they have told you  however i must caution you that counsel ' s speech is not evidence and you are not obliged to act on it unless you agree with what they have said  and you will not hesitate to reject anything that you will find to have no merit or substance  by the same token what mr young told you in his opening speech is not evidence  it is merely an outline of what the prosecution was expecting to prove during this trial  for instance mr young told you that he would call three eye-witnesses but as a matter of fact only two eye-witnesses were called mr young was right you would not speculate or guess what the third uh witness might or might not say  he has not uh given evidence so there ' s no evidence coming from you from him  i will now say a few words about my responsibility and your responsibility and that ' s our respective function in this trial  it is my function to direct you as to the law and that is to say to tell you what the law is  you must accept what i tell you with regard to the law as being correct and apply it to the facts which you will find to have been established  the facts are completely different in total contrast to my role as the judge of law you are the judge the sole judge of facts both individually and collectively  it ' s for you to decide what evidence you will accept and what evidence you will reject  it ' s also for you to decide what inferences or conclusions you would draw from the established facts  that you must not speculate you must not guess  ultimately it will be you and no one else who will decide whether each defendant is guilty or not guilty  if i happen to express any views on the evidence of which have no appeal to you it is your duty to reject them  on the other hand if i omit to mention evidence which you think is important you must take it into consideration just as if i stress evidence that you think unimportant you must ignore it  you are perfectly entitled to accept to reject either in whole or in part the evidence of any witness  if you come to the conclusion that part of the evidence of a witness is true and part is untrue you will accept the part you believe to be true and reject the part that you believe to be untrue   in deciding whether each defendant is guilty or not guilty  you will apply your combined common sense and experience in life as intelligent and reasonable men and women of the world  it is a cardinal principle of our criminal law in hong kong  that a person is presumed to be innocent until he or she is proved guilty the burden is on the prosecution to prove each defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt  and that is to say the prosecution must satisfy you on the evidence  so that you can be sure of the guilt of each defendant   though the two defendants are charged and tried together  you must consider the case against and for each defendant separately  and return a separate verdict in respect of each  the fact you may find one defendant guilty does not mean that the other defendant is also guilty  vice versa if you find one of them not guilty it does not mean that you have to find the other defendant guilty not guilty  the two defendants did not give evidence in the witness box  they are not obliged to give evidence  they are entitled to to sit back in the dock and require the prosecution to prove the case against them  you must not assume each defendant is guilty because he has not  given evidence  each defendant has raised the defence of alibi and has called witnesses to testify on their behalf  i will deal with this aspect of their case at a later stage  right now i would like to ask you to look at that indictment  which uh is in front of you  this is a document which sets out the offence for which the two defendants are charged and the particulars of that offence  a defendant is also referred to as the accused in a criminal trial and there ' s no uh a distinction nor any difference between these two words the two defendants are vietnamese boat people at the time of this incident at the time of this incident took place both of them were inmates of the whitehead detention center in section number three  they are charged with murder of another inmate and the particulars of the offence are these  vu dac hong and bui hui thuyet on the thirty-first day of october nineteen ninety-one inside section three whitehead detention center shatin new territories hong kong murdered hoang minh-tuyen  what is murder  it is the unlawful killing of one person by another person with intent either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm  unlawful means without legal justification or excuse  grievous bodily harm is simply serious bodily injury  it is important that you do not confuse intent with motive  intention to kill or to cause serious bodily injury  members of the jury the time has now come for me to sum up this case to you  in about an hour ' s time i will ask you to retire to  consider your verdicts and that is to decide whether the accused are guilty or not guilty  in the course of my summing up i will endeavour to tell you what is the law to be applied to this case and to draw your attention to some salient features of the evidence which i hope may assist you in your deliberation  you have already heard speeches from counsel both for the prosecution and for the defence  you will give very careful consideration to what they have said to you  however i must tell you what counsel said in their speeches is not evidence and is not binding on you  you only take into account matters if you agree with them  and must not hesitate hesitate to reject anything that that you uh do not agree  it your oath requires you to try this case and to return your verdicts strictly according to the evidence  in the present case evidence consists of all the oral testimony  given in the witness box the uh admitted facts and the uh exhibits  that is the evidence in this case  you will completely ignore anything that might have come to your knowledge from other sources such as reading newspaper reports  because that is not evidence  the uh charges which these accused face are certainly unpleasant and distasteful offences  they involved two young girls of just over thirteen and fourteen respectively  but members of the jury you are not here to judge the moral character or moral standard of these individuals  your function is to decide whether the accused have committed the offences and you will decide this issue strictly on the evidence  you will keep out of your mind any bias prejudice against the accused or any sympathy for the uh two young girls and their families emotion has no place to play has no place in our criminal justice system  the law protects the innocent and punishes the guilty  it ' s important at this stage for me to say a few words to you about my responsibility and your responsibility and that is our respective functions in this trial  it ' s my duty to tell you what the law is and how to apply it to the issues of fact that you have to decide  you must accept what i tell you about the law as being correct  and apply it to the facts which you find to have been established  but the facts are different in total contrast to my role as the judge of law you are the judge and the sole judge of facts both individually and collectively as a jury   it is for you to decide what evidence you accept and what evidence you will reject  it ' s also for you to decide what inferences or conclusions  you will draw from the established facts  to draw inferences is to make logical deductions from established facts but you must not spec speculate  speculation is guessing and you must not guess  you must not guess what uh uh might have or might not have happened on the dates in question  you can only decide uh the issues that are before you on the uh facts on the evidence  ultimately members of jury it ' s you and you alone who will decide whether the accused or any of them are guilty or not guilty  in the discharge of your important responsibility you will apply to combine common sense and experience in life as mature informed and responsible members of the community  you will take a broad view of the evidence  you are perfectly entitled to accept everything a witness says  or reject everything because you are the judge of facts  you may also accept part of the evidence of a witness and reject the other part or parts if you believe part of the evidence is true and the rest is untrue  this is only common sense  from time to time during my summing up i may express views on the evidence or on the facts  it ' s your duty to reject them unless you agree with the views i express because in that case they will become your views  for the same reason if i mention or emphasize evidence that you consider unimportant you will ignore that evidence  on the other hand if i do not mention the evidence that you uh regard as important you will take that evidence into account in the course of your deliberation  it is a cardinal principle of the criminal law in hong kong  that a person is presumed innocent until he or she is proved guilty  the prosecution must prove the accused ' s guilt  an accused does not have to prove his innocence  before you can convict any accused you must be sure of his guilt and that is the same thing as being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt  you have in front of you a copy of the indictment  this is the document setting out the offences with which the accused are charged and the particulars of those offences  at the outset there were a total of five accused and you recall that midway through the trial i discharged you from returning any verdict in respect of lai ngai sze and fung pik han the two female accused this effectively leaves only the three male accused on the indictment and lai ngai sze the fourth accused and fung pik han the fifth accused are now out of the picture and no longer your concern  you will also recall as a result of concessions made by mr lavac  counsel of prosecution and on my direction you returned formal verdicts of not guilty on counts one two three and four against lit chung pui the third accused which means that he is not facing these charges the indictment as now stands has three accused and twelve counts  and that each count has one uh accused or defendant as there are three accused and a multiplicity of counts you must consider each count separately and the case against each and for each accused separately  you will return a separate verdict on each count  the fact that you find one accused guilty does not mean that the other accused must also be guilty and vice versa  similarly the fact that you find one accused guilty on one count it does mean that he must also be guilty on the other counts and of course vice versa
