""
""
so
""
""
i will be very busy later because we have to apply jobs
""
""
yes
 
""
yeah 
""
what are some of the places you applied already 
""
""
yaohan
 
""
that  ' s all 
""
""
and some banks some advertising company
 
""
good 
""
""
but it  ' s quite difficult to find a job uh  through uh
school  because uhm nowadays we have many candidates our school uh our
schoolmates apply for the same jobs but only for a few vacancies
 
""
yeah
""
oh see what happens 
""
""
very competitive
 
""
what about you amy
""
where have you applied 
""
""
oh same case
 
""
same 
""
""
but it  ' s quite weird
""
we have a friend uh from uh she has just uh uh uh graduated from
uh  berkeley
 
""
where 
""
""
uc berkeley
 
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
she  ' s come but uh it  ' s a very famous school
 
""
oh yeah
""
of course 
""
""
but she uh uh cannot find a good job  right now
""
i don't know why because uh she  ' s back for  nearly  two to
three months and she cannot find it
""
""
maybe she  she uh she  lack of experience
 
""
yeah 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
that  ' s always a problem  you know it  ' s like  you applied
for jobs and  then they say well you don't have any experience 
""
""
uh huh
 
""
cause i don't have a job yet you know
""
if i have a job i  ' ll have experience you know
""
but uhm 
""
""
train us 
$a-and-$b-laugh 
 
""
but uh you you just have to keep trying 
""
""
yeah
 
""
you know
""
it  ' s     almost like fishing 
""
sometimes if if you are lucky you get a fish huh you know 
""
""
 oh  
""

""
""
especially nowadays more and more graduate    are
""
""
