<I>
well a very good evening
welcome to the macau jockey club ' s taipo racecourse once again we
have ah sand racing this evening the going is normal watering 
ten race programme and the runners behind the barriers for race
number two 
the kembla grange handicap class six gallopers over a thousand and
fifty metres and favourite throughout has been the horse on screen at the
moment that is super treasure from the michael kent stable having the second
start for him to be ridden by andy tsang 
we will of course bring you a replay of race one in around twenty
five minutes ah first of all though we ' ll give you our selections for this
ah second event 
franko lau likes the chances of two tau fair two he ' s a ten to one
quote to defeat one super treasure and nine golden apple two one and nine for
franko lau 
and harry troy going the way of super treasure two yau fair two
three happy horse and nine golden apple 
and myself i ' ve liked the run of gold champion of late number eight
and i ' m willing to put him on top 
ahead of number one super treasure and three happy horse ah 
super treasure for me he ' s the banker material in the race you can
banker him to being in your qs and your tierces 
but ah he is always a risk of winning these types of races you look
at his record only two wins ten times he ' s been placed in second and 
how many times have those ah placings ah of those ten placings that
he ' s loomed up to win ah but when under pressure just doesn't seem to want
to go on with it ah did a pretty good effort first up but again second place
for super treasure so 
for me he ' s one really to play around in the qs and multi banker
maybe in the tierces and 
you can probably stand him out as far as the tierces are concerned
but to take the one point seven for him to win the race is a bit of a risk
i ' ve gone eight gold champion one super treasure and as far as
three happy horse is concerned ah i ' ve thrown him in for third it ' s going
to be ah concern if he jumps out of the gates cleaning because he hasn't been
jumping out of the gates well 
but he ' s still been running pretty well under the circumstances i
thought if he did happen to get out of the gates ah reasonably well tonight
he would have to be a legitimate chance 
and also got to stress that number nine golden apple who is the ah
second favourite at six to one is another that ah has not been jumping
cleanly from the gates in recent times so i ' m just willing to leave him out
on that score 
the fact that he ' s six to one and 
the other one that i mentioned not jumping well happy horse he ' s
twenty to one so i ' d rather be throwing him in 
eight one and three 
quickly go through the changes for tonight ' s programme 
ah the first change comes in the third event number three i can fly
is out he ' s replaced by the first standby the way i know barrier nine k s
tam to take that ride 
race four is clear of changes in the fifth event number five
shanghai industry has been withdrawn he ' s replaced by the second standby 
number five will be easy and happy barrier six horace lam to ride
and a late withdrawal in that fifth event number ten always improve is out
and there ' s no replacement runner 
our next change comes in race six number nine flying stride is out
he ' s replaced by the first standby the griffin graduate number nine will be
diamond stars barrier eleven bradley stewart takes that ride 
races seven eight nine and ten are all clear of changes at this
stage 
red light through for race two super treasure at sixteen dollars
fifty and sixty five dollars for nine golden apple and ninety dollars and
fifty cents for eight gold champion 
i ' ve gone eight one and three 
i ' m the captain steve mooney we ' ll be joined later on tonight by
franko lau but first of all 
it ' s a very good evening to our race caller tonight harry troy 
thanks steve and a very good evening everyone 
as the runners start to load for the second of the night it ' s the
kembla grange handicap flashing at one point six super treasure 
and he has been at a similar quote throughout 
nicely drawn barrier two andy tsang taking 
three pounds off his back 
all clear is up and they ' re off and running and he came out
running did the favourite 
getting away very well tonight was happy horse he ' s going to take
up the early ah lead and joined by yau fair two now tai fat hero prominent
also making a line of three but scooting up on the inside now to take the
lead is is ah golden apple 
joined by happy horse making a line of three then is uh tai fat
hero 
favourite getting the drop on them in fourth and that ' s super
treasure a little bit deep no money no honey but more prominent tonight yau
fair two has dropped back now to a midfield position 
now sneaking up on the inside of yau fair two is leun yat victory
tenor forever prominent followed then by all steady he ' s losing ground 
gold champion a long way back tonight followed then by great gain
and jolly good fellow whips them in 
on towards the corner happy horse has run via the cape and dashing
to the front tai fat hero 
giving chase super treasure 
running on fairly down the outside no money no honey yau fair two
in the centre 
but nicely clear is tai fat hero inside the final one fifty giving
chase super treasure no money no honey runs on 
but racing away is tai fat hero who ' s a bit too strong for super
treasure 
closing late great gain for third then came no money no honey jolly
good fellow running on when the race was all over followed by leun yat
victory 
next over the line was gold champion yau fair two followed then by
all steady 
golden apple ' s pulled up very quickly and happy horse after
running off the track has run stone motherless last 
now tenor forever in fact it was 
i think that come through late for third 
it was in fact tenor forever in the purple cap great gain in the
checkered cap was the one that finished back towards the tail but 
tai fat hero in the hands of bash siu 
he ' s got away a little bit better last start 
and after being away much better today 
he took up the running from super treasure 
he enjoyed a nice run behind them super treasure and he has run on
okay 
but never going to pick up tai fat hero and the old timer tenor
forever 
runs on nicely for third and not too far away no money no honey so
it ' s eleven 
one and seven 
eleven one and seven after the running of race number two 
and the winner number eleven 
tai fat hero eric suen prepares bash siu rode 
seven year old bay brown australian bred gelding by king ' s high
from steel sculptress 
he ' s been a long time out of the winners circle this fellow 
did have a very good sand record previous 
and a couple of wins to his credit at the distance but he ' s been a
long while out of form descended from class four to class six and he ' s
finally broken through tonight number one is second 
super treasure 
andy tsang rode super treasure for mick kent number seven winding
up in third tenor forever 
and the apprentice c chao rode for kee ha lei 
officially fourth was number six no money no honey bit better run
by him he was away much better tonight and eureka rosa de silva rode for joe
murphy so 
it ' s eleven one seven and six after the running of race number
two 
bash siu earning his riding fee tonight because actually ah
the ah while they were in the parade ring he actually ah tai fat hero
dislodged bash bash siu who ' s walking a little gingerly but he ' s taken a
ride and uh he ' s been victorious 
number eleven tai fat hero three hundred and forty four fifty the
win thirty six dollars the place it ' s another second for super treasure that ' s
the eleventh on the sand in his career 
he returns twelve fifty number seven tenor forever running in third
at forty one fifty 
one and eleven quinella one hundred and eighty four fifty the
tierce ten thousand five hundred and eighty two 
the winning margin one and a half lengths there was two and three
quarters between second and third they ' ve ran one o five point seven 
not a bad run time ah only one second outside of the class record
in recent meetings they ' ve usually been around two seconds outside
of the class record so the track hasn't been riding that fast so we ' ll get a
an idea later on but it just seems a reasonable ah 
time having a look at it eleven one and seven are the numbers for
race two 
 commercial break 
welcome back live to taipo racecourse we now have the weighed
in sign for race two and the numbers are eleven one and seven 
tai fat hero winning for eric suen and bash siu three hundred and
forty four fifty and thirty six dollars 
number one super treasure twelve fifty seven tenor forever running
in third at forty one fifty 
a hundred and eighty four fifty for the q 
ten thousand five hundred and eighty two for the tierce one and a
half by two and three quarters 
one o five point seven 
well i have to say it was a strangely run race the two horses that
usually uh miss the start golden apple and happy horse were there prominent
and happy horse ah running out of the track ah this left tai fat hero getting
a nice run through super treasure 
he ' s doing the chasing but again it ' s just another second placing
for him 
ah behind ah the first two horses really not much to look at
eventually tenor forever running on to grab that third position 
yeah tenor forever the old timer it ' s a long time since he ' s
been out of in the top three spot 
but he did run okay best of the rest 
these two got right away tai fat hero a very well graded horse here
in class six and he ' s slowly ran himself into something like race fitness
and he ' s just been a bit too good for them and away much better tonight 
he was part of the lead with yau fair two 
happy horse begun very well and showing good speed but wanted to
hang coming to the turn and he ' s run right off the track 
but booting right up on the inside golden apple away a little
better today taking up the running from happy horse in the centre 
a bit deep tai fat hero 
and on the back of them super treasure an and he has enjoyed the
run of the race 
in the white colours in the lime cap that ' s no money no honey not
too far away tenor forever and yau fair two 
and drifting back at that point was 
ah let me see all steady lost ground very very quickly at this
point 
gold champion was back and never ever travelling steve and 
he ' s been disappointing tonight and leun yat victory the horse in
the black cap didn't show much speed tonight 
you can se happy horse running right off the track obviously 
he ' s going to pull up with some problem
