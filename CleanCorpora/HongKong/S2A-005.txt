thirty three for the favourite country dragon he  ' s been
popular most of the way through the betting in fact all of the way through
the betting  but dragon win continues to trickle down and he  ' s now at
forty one dollars  the seven horse jade ruyi from eleven a little while
ago to ninety dollars  whereas this fella wealthy together is a big price
he  ' s over one hundred to one  and it  ' s he and faithful assurance i
believe the only two runners to move in
""
so wealthy together they work on at the moment  faithful
assurance went pretty well first up the other day on soft ground he ran
second there  he comes into this event and it  ' s a pretty low grade event
as well  he  ' s got a wide barrier draw the three horse  simon yim takes
the ride on him today  must be thought of as a major chance and the public
rate him that he  ' s fifty dollars and third favourite 
""
this fellow wealthy together does not want to go in  now he  ' s at
the back of the gates and they  ' ve got him squared up now  he  ' s half way
in  couple of extra attendants come around behind and they  ' re just trying
to get him in that last little bit
""
looks as though they  ' ve won the battle  so he  ' s ready 
standby for a start  they  ' re all away flag is up and they  ' re racing 
""
allez allez slow to go wealthy together away only fairly beloved
partner began very well  country dragon booting up and between the pair
flying magic 
""
dragon win with the ears scrubbed off to hold the rail and will do
it for the moment from country dragon and out three deep at them flying magic
 hot pot eases behind them and beloved partner now dropped back in fifth
and sixth faithful assurance outside that brigade  wealthy together next
from money star nazakat the second team tonic allez allez  jade ruyi
dropped to last of all at the twelve hundred metre mark 
""
country dragon pushes on and will go to the top  dragon win drops
in second flying magic third  a length hot pot the middle from faithful
assurance posted three deep  and beloved partner three back the rail  a
length and a half wealthy together by the thousand  on the inside nazakat
the second  three lengths money star team tonic  jade ruyi outside

""
country dragon leads at the half mile they  ' re half way  the
margin a length dragon win second flying magic ahead three deep now third and
posted there  beloved partner the rails getting up to be behind the
leading brigade from hot pot  faithful assurance a length and a half
wealthy together nazakat the second  next then money star out three wide
pushing on jade ruyi  he  ' s still eight to ten off the lead he  ' d want to
get a move on  allez allez underneath him and last of all is team tonic
""
""
around the circle  country dragon travels well by a length 
second under pressure dragon win beloved partner going for the run in the
middle  it comes but will he kick hard  they  ' ve gone two lengths to
faithful assurance jade ruyi still runs on four off them  country dragon
one paced in front dragon win  ' s at his girth 
""
he  ' s trying to get closer  jade ruyi staying on at beloved
partner for third  country dragon puts his grate he keeps on going 
country dragon too good for dragon win jade ruyi third  that  ' s the way
they finish 
""
country dragon by a length and a half  dragon win second  out
wide jade ruyi continued to stay on well and made ground third  nazakat
the second next followed by beloved partner allez allez  faithful
assurance hot pot money star team tonic 
""
wealthy together and flying magic leads the flying carpet he was
last of all 
""
country dragon too good number one is first  the price was short
but he won well 
""
he pressed forward from gate two
""
he used the position well 
""
he was the leader on the circuit and he was just too good for them
today 
""
got a good pat down the shoulder as well as holds a good length and
a half margin on dragon win 
""
he doesn't do it quickly but he does stay on and for this grade
that  ' s an effort  normally they  ' re done at the four hundred but dragon
win was one paced but he just keeps on battling on in that position 
""
he  ' s done his best to finish in second and jade ruyi who  ' s come
from last at the seven hundred metre mark has had to loop around the field
 and has continued to stay on well for third 
""
it was a solid effort by him and let  ' s remember he  ' s got a horse
that  ' s got a nine and zip record 
""
so they  ' re low grade but someone  ' s got to win them  the public
thought that country dragon had his chance
""
it  ' s been a good effort by tony cruz to produce him fresh 
""
first up for him he  ' s been able to win 
""
five second dragon win officially  seven jade ruyi third  and
beloved partner who was there on the corner looked to have had every chance
on face value to hold his position  but he  ' s not great over the sixteen
fifty and he just battled on the final stages finishing in fourth 
""
it was a one forty one point one run  and the dividends are
thirty five and fourteen fifty  so five to two the winner  sixteen for
the runner up  twenty two for third  popular quinella at sixty five
dollars and a tierce dividend is still to come through
""
so it  ' s one five seven and two  two races down  two
favourites home 
""
""
yes  both bearing the saddle cloth number one   spent
 a bit of time up front they  ' ve come home very slow  one forty one
one 
""
they were on target to get under the class record the way they were
going up to the half way point 
""
they broke twenty eight seconds early and that was country dragon
pressing the leader and eventually rolling  and then he broke twenty four
seconds uh from the twelve to the eight hundred metres so he really went
along and earned earned his victory here tonight
""
here  ' s the tierce  it  ' s paid eight hundred and twenty dollars
 eight hundred and twenty dollars the tierce  on one five and seven 
only a handful of chances so it seems to be a reasonable pay out  with the
quinella sixty five dollars  sixty five even  fourth home was number
two beloved partner   commercial break 
""
""
we don't always see the races pan out like that with leaders
working that hard to eventually get across and then uh you  ' ve got a fairly
strong horse on your back dragon win  eight times out of ten the strong
horse would come off your back and beat you 
""
""
he  ' s an eighteen hundred metre horse though isn't he  and
i think that  ' s uh a simple case of a  miler who  ' s beaten a mile and a
quarter horse here and a mile and a quarter horse was never quick enough to
really  get and lay down a challenge  it didn't really matter how quick
country dragon went if he got the mile he was going to win it  it was a
question of if he didn't get the mile then the other horse would have keep uh
kept galloping and would have come over the top of him but uh no i think they  ' ve
probably done their homework pretty much nigh on right here  they  ' ve uh
decided that the mile is his trip they  ' ll go out and make him get every yard
of it and its worked out nicely for them 
""
first run as you say for tony cruz felix coetzee aboard and uh just
another well rated ride ride by felix coetzee  we  ' ve said it so many
times in the past  let  ' s hope we say it plenty of times again this season
""
""
""
so that  ' s win number three of the season now for tony cruz
""
""
""
he  ' s had very few unplaced horses out of his runners this
season so far 
""
""
a uh yeah he  ' d be  he is a trainer that  ' s entitled to
blow up with a hard luck story  six seconds 
""
""
mmmmm
""
""
and one third 
""
""
he  ' s uh come pretty close to winning in the big race last
weekend of course with red sun  he just got run out of things but uh all
in all  the yard is in great form the horse are firing on all cylinders
and uh well tony will be more than happy to see this one come home by what a
length and a half  just about that  over dragon win  jade ruyi doing
all his best work in the closing stages  just a slight worry there about
how much improvements left 
""
beloved partner  be interested in him next time back over 1400
at sha tin that should uh suit him
""
""
money star went awful 
""
""
mmmmm didn't he  didn't he just  yes  he  ' s a 
certainly going to have to drop down the handicap to see him with a winning
chance 
""
""
at least the other fancied runner had some excuse faithful
assurance  he was caught three wide  from his wide draw without cover
""
""
""
the ground was the worry though wasn't it  you know how
many times have uh you seen that a horse that really wants cut in the ground
when he gets on a firmer surface  and in all fairness darren he actually
didn't look the part here tonight  whereas last uh weekend he looked great
""
