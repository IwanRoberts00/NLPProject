<I>
one more thing about uhm the c test
uhm the test was conducted in st francis in fanling and in 
shek kip mei 
 shek kip mei 
so there are more than enough form four and uhm but
the form four and i the the test that i did uhm was a bit unfortunate because
uhm so happen that it it was held after the exam
and some of the students i don't know whether they are better ones
or poor ones
they have already left the exam
then they can leave early in in in the
room exam you see 
 uhm uhm 
 they have the exam 
 uhm 
 oh 
 i see 
 okay after right after which is i see 
 yeah and then another thing it was i i told 
 them that there is no time limit on the test and
so many of them just didn't take it se seriously 
and just uhm did half way and then decided to go because they are hungry or
 tired or whatever
 yeah 
 oh 
 finish it yeah yeah 
 uhm 
 
 oh 
alright 
so the reality was affected but luckily uhm there is another
 branch of form four students at the at the
shek kip mei 
 yes 
 in shek kip mei 
 
 but alright the other categ 
dis 
 that is slightly yeah it ' s slightly different
uh different on the zoom 
each of uh the classes with uhm well invigilated by the form
teacher and it was small form
 
 right 
 and then 
i believe that it it t would be more consistent actually
the the uhm students in shek kip mei uhm of uhm better level
better entry level 
because uhm when they first started the school in fanling they
just accepted some students from other schools left over from other schools
but the ones in form one are the better ones which 
they they are the band two band one students
uhm but the the the form form four that ' s
 she really anything you know could be really the the bottom
 uhm 
 uhm 
 but two words 
 
 i ' m now check 
and uhm for the test in shek kip mei i have uh faxed the
headmaster the headmistress of uhm this instruction sheet been uh read by
form teacher regulated circulated 
 
 it was uhm uhm 
 everything is small uniform
 
 yes will that i i ' ve to i mean call you
that for october because of me because i was you know
 uni 
 yeah 
yes so uhm maybe i can photocopy one to be
attached with the minutes or 
 
 i suddenly i realize i can 
 okay 
 
 that ' s a good idea 
we haven't done the one for the form six have we did
i 
 we have alright 
 yeah yeah 
 with with shek kip mei
with shek kip mei alright 
 shek kip mei is form two three four and 
six 
 okay 
another thing i wanted to raise is uhm let see uhm
 to no form three
two two three four and six
no form one and form four
we have to contact uh the panel chairlady at uh st.
francis uh other the polite i believe is a name
 to get the results 
 uh ha 
yes
mrs light
yeah and
she ' s in fanling
she ' s in fanling yes
so uhm who ' s going to do that
i can do that
you mean to get the school result
to correlate with the school result 
 yeah two words 
 i mention them with uh uh to the headmistress uh
uh mary chan uhm at shek kip mei and she said uhm 
she can
 uhm 
 she 
she can arrange that 
 yeah 
 i think she ' s on leave 
 has has been done 
 yeah we ' re doing what we done 
now i think they are back for secondary school
 you see with the ex 
 no 
form five yeah 
 uh 
 form five form three exam result uhm
could you put it in the minutes so that we won't forget
 wait 
 so i can contact mary to gets 
uhm since i ' ve matter 
 
 so this is the other job for the ras this is one
word 
i can contact mary
 
 let ' s what you have to work you have keep 
 okay
so susanna will be contacting the uhm 
shek kip mei uh headmistress
 uh this one word can do this 
 in future 
okay and terrance will trace the other
light yeah
 and one word 
 one word 
okay uhm
is she the vice principal i think
temporary
yeah
uhm temporary
she will be be placed the
to to into her old job later
 okay anyway 
 the 
and uhm for the school result uh the english result
uhm we want everything for the english result
i mean not just at all the score but also the
 total score plus the breakdown
 breakdown 
 breakdown 
 breakdown yeah 
 okay total plus
because we i want to see how they correlate with the the the
seed result correlated with the two words 
 several words 
 one word test 
 will these people be very busy now and will
they be very inconvenience if the
well secondary school teaches are busy
all the time 
 all the time anyway 
 yes 
 particularly september so maybe why to do it
 earl before september
it ' s september they whatever we 
 
 three words 
 it is not many not slightly easy i mean uhm uhm
 
 well yeah when they go back for their staff meeting 
yeah if they can do that uh when they go back to
 the for their staff 
 i mean 
 yeah 
 maybe you can contact them asap that will be the
best
unless let them know and then let them have time to
prepare
 uhm uhm 
then i promise to give them the seed result uhm and
 impossible give some comments from 
 uh 
 then tell them we will give it to them by
november
i think that will give us sufficient time to tell
 some 
when the ras are here they they processed the data and then give
the answer but maybe then never 
 what one ccdd 
 
 yeah but i will say give it give it softly you
way
because if we take if we give it to them then
they will be one word 
 tell them november three words
 are ready uhm 
 uhm 
 okay 
 yeah a bit too late
 
yeah uh no i mean they for soons 
 are you think they you you think they won't be
happy if it is november
no of course the test was held uhm in june right
in june
july july see and a line is late june
so the feedback comes too lately
 in june yeah
in july or for mere july the first 
 oh okay 
 uhm 
okay late november because we have to compare their
results
without one word result we cannot tell
anything
 
 we should oh maybe we 
that ' s right two words what those ones 
uhm uhm
so
 
who you can okay yeah 
i mean people will be happy we tell them date 
 in that extend it might be if if it if it will
help
i mean you expect our one two ras will be operating within two
three weeks
no
mine
if my they will be taking out she won't be able to start duty
until end of this month
 
okay 
mine has to give a month notice to the present appointment
she ' s working
yeah hong kong tourist association 
 which which one grace 
uh the other one uh this 
 one word 
 
she ' s a tourist one word yes i got it
but what i was thinking was that maybe in time of uh if it ' s was
spread on the teachers to get their results
we can send ra over so that they can lecturely be shown
what collect
i mean with this with the teacher one word 
let ' s presume the other messaging matter of getting authorizing
files and that could the ra job to relief the teacher
do you think that ' s practical 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
so the ras can do uhm collect results from the schools
uhm let me proceeds seed test
did you see just now uhm about another duty for
 
uh tracing us laugh 
it it it ' s this usual thing we produce 
 but we still need to contact uhm 
 first
 it 
i i was going to say i i like to give you a deadlines so you know
when this need to be done
uhm tell them if they can give the result which was
 uhm before the end of august then we ' ll try to give
them back the result our feedback by eighth of september
i think that ' s quite sensible
 it was 
 
 yes i one word 
yes a long pause 
tenth september you mean
uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 okay 
it should be enough time right it ' s
 
 yeah okay 
 yeah 
yeah well 
 okay i have a rough rough
number on on what uh how many of the uh the subjects have to
taken
how many of the subjects have taken the seed test
 do you anything yeah 
 on 
for shek kip mei is uhm four classes of form two four classes
of form three and four from form four and two from form six
so how do
so you don't know the total number
 okay 
what about four 
 no 
 no 
 because number varies the class 
 okay thanks 
 form one is about two hundred
two hundred
about yeah
 five classes are form one
form four uh i can't really remember it maybe about
thirty 
 oh 
 the whole 
 it two words when we
 correct the test 
 faith 
 thirty 
yeah
only thirty 
 only 
yeah
when we correct the test we can count the 
two words 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
it ' s not the buried at all because uhm it ' s
too duplicated but anyway that that bunch doesn't fit in the rest of the
school anyway
dominantly doesn't consider of uh st. francis students
 yeah 
okay right uhm so it ' s over anything else
well the anything is that i made a terrible mistake in typo a
typo error
instead of st. francis i type in one on one of the 
answer sheet d instead of uh s must be well several words
yeah but i discover this uhm after i have copied the 
whole log of things so but unless 
 uh 
 
 yeah 
 so she 
 that there were two typo errors that we
found in the form one test
 yeah 
in the form one test
yeah i can't remember which part 
 answer sheet or 
 answer sheet or
i can't remember but the the the matter any
okay
yeah
uhm so the next time when you give uhm one word
 bureau uh seed sample for the uh native speakers we give them the
answer sheet as well
uh yeah maybe i can give them the answer sheet 
 one word 
 
 i say as far as giving that this sheet for them
uhm uhm
 
okay i meant i didn't give the one that i had the
answer sheet 
 yeah 
 oh 
i i mean because this several
words 
 but 
 
 but i i know i just wasn't sure about
 that i mean 
 yeah 
 yeah 
maybe we need to be consistent this is it the first three
 haven't got anything
 yeah it ' s alright because 
yeah because uhm well we we uh decide it an answer sheet for those
because uh it will be easier for mark because they are in
large quantity 
 but for the native speaker one
word 
 to marking 
 yes 
 but this one 
 i know it ' ll be easier for them to see whether
they ' ve done the wrong thing or not if they got it this way
than on the plant this way yeah
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 
i mean i i haven't thought because if given is a small number
that presumably to get them to mark it themselves
i mean what was the function of giving them the answer sheet just
bring information basics 
 uhm 
 just for easy marking 
 yeah 
 just for 
 
 right 
i think it can be consistent then leave it at
what uhm has been done
okay so finish
 okay 
yeah
okay then we will go to ra duties
 
can we just uh check this uhm well uh just one thing i want to
say about uhm angel two word name her 
chinese name 
 uh 
 yi song 
 kai ming 
 
song kai kai yin
uhm she she ' s spent a year
she did she did uhm as you know she did the uh 
 less ma
and for some reason she didn't choose the efl option 
 
i can't remember the details so it now 
but uhm she came back and was uncertain exactly what she wanted
to do so she ' s been working in the tourist association
she ' s not very happy with that and uh she
wants some ac ac academic stimulus
 now i talk to her before this came out i advise
her to apply for anything that come up to the papers for research studentship
and i say she would be in a one word situation in a
sense that whether career it looks to me and it will come into this
 whether career for anybody in linguistics is concerned in hong kong
it ' s it ' s it ' s got to be a bilinguists 
even if you been have a theoretical bias 
 that whether works is and that ' s whether jobs got
to be 
so i say that she really need it uh my options
she really opt to go one of them was to go into the classroom and
she say she wasn't ready at the moment
she seems bright when she came across the way
that she use
so i said that uhm whatever ra she she got
she should be using it as a stimulus to do series reading that
she capable of that
 so part of the restricted ra jobs which should
be introduce same of
 she ' s kind of us you know i think it would be
easily push to read the background theory and uh 
discussion
so this kind of project i think might be very
useful for her 
 song 
 ma 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 no 
 no she ' s some she came from 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 i know 
 yeah 
actually that was uh susanna ' s uhm idea to that she 
would be capable of doing deep review and 
when 
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 
 exactly exactly 
so i mean we can use her as the resource
that will be good for her but it will be good
for the project 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
she ' s also thinking of using the the
opportunity maybe to enrol for an mphil
 
 so 
yes well that that that uh 
that should be no problem getting her part time mphil 
 restriction uh 
i would think that this year is one word 
 than the work you should be looked into get settle in this
work 
uhm draw on and make sure she reaches the background stuff 
 and then in consultation with you or anybody else
isolated topic uhm given she ' s not on a rush
 i mean she may think she is in a rush 
 
but from time from our from points of view supervisor would
always like to try to get people who have in fact done about the years work
thinking reading and so on to the point where they really
know what their topic is at that stage
it might change later on but the point is uh initial stage of
work
you will save a lot of hesitation for her as well as her
supervisor
but i think that should be no problem of getting a part time
registration
i ' ve got to check i ' ve to chaise there ' s another 
unfinished business pass
i ' ve got to check about whether we can give you three
words supervise which i ' ve been very to uh
i think it should be no problem but i ' ve got to confirm it 
 with the committee
but uhm that was just background on her
i think she ' s a kind of person that may be good for us 
 that we can push her 
 she mention that 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 no 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 oh i see 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
she she came across as the best of the uh five candidates 
 that be 
 
 that ' s interesting because uh uhm
i ' m glad i wasn't there
 because i don't no i don't know her as a students
 to i know her through a friend
 and it ' s nice to have your independent 
opinion uh but she came from smile 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 smart and dependable
 
 yeah 
yeah you ' re right 
 was one word 
 i think she ' s she is our first choice
she is
yeah she is and after that uhm is 
uh the teacher
 
 yes 
 uhm 
 
 grace 
 uh 
 grace 
 yeah 
 grace 
 
 yes 
grace yes yeah 
 she was 
grace was good uh only that she look a bit but uhm
i won't say nervous but she came across it ' s uhm
yeah she she felts un yeah un uneasy
 uh like uncertain maybe difference difference 
 
 
yeah a bit shy or 
yeah
 
that ' s right
i mean she ' s that ' s that ' s my impression too
and she always produce component work
she ' s never been a star but she 
never fails and she never she i think she always been on time for 
deadlines which given that she ' s a teaching
it ' s it ' s a very good implication 
you know the the ones who ' s more problematic at the expect 
several words you know
i want to speak one of my i won't say pleasure but i ' m very
glad to be able to say the expert not form the way just whoever no chinese
can taste it 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 which one word 
 yeah 
 about the 
 so quite reliable 
not even the cost 
 
 no 
 ne whatever we can't
i mean it ' s difficult for us
we don't want to be seems to be discriminating
 yeah actually favourite fat favourite favourite
favourite all the they have uh and that natural lunch had it
i would uh say almost turn out the opposite one word
 over confidently
they think they get away but they can't but uhm
yes uh grace i think it ' s reliable and uh she ' s not
stupid at all
 i mean she ' s just has this manner which looks a
bit shy a difference or whatever 
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 no 
 yeah yeah 
i believe it it it ' s a manner we usual self
 of 
 
 yeah 
 so so you have interviewed five 
candidates 
 five 
 yes 
the third choice is the uhm fresh graduate that uh 
 woman from from baptist who who has already registered for a
ma in baptist
 yes 
 from bap baptist 
that ' s right
 
that ' s right 
you mention about the native people
uhm i didn't interview him because he
i ' ve uh this feeling that he was a kind of backpacker or want to
earn a little bit of money and then will move on to another country 
 as soon as he he he can buy the air ticket 
 yeah
and he what he he has got no background in linguistics apart
from helping in a translation a machine translation project in japan which he
did quite well uh accord according to letter of reference
uhm he rang me up at home he rang me at work and then i was too
busy and then i told gave him my home number
and he was probably ringing me from a disco
jj in wanchai or some what in lan kwai fong
so i thought it it well it doesn't came across it alright
i mean came across as a the kind of come across 
 one word 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 two words 
yeah he should had of course 
you has the one word 
 yeah 
 
 yeah 
 pushing him very very very hard to
sell himself 
 
 uhm 
okay uhm so in uh the cp exercise there were we have let
see how many two
no more than two
we interview more one word uh 
three interview 
 some didn't turn up i remem 
 uh 
 i 
one didn't turn up and she rang 
and tell told us that she couldn't come and then we interview
two two 
and this one was on uh was uh out of town 
and otherwise we would have interviewed her you know sung 
 sung and uh 
 yeah 
 
 right 
 she rang right 
 two only uh 
 yeah 
 
 yes right okay yeah 
 i didn't remember the face at all 
 by the mean she will pretend you 
 she she range i left the message and uh she
rang when she came back and asking for whether uhm we can give her an
interview i say don't worry you have a bright rather uhm i mean the same
thing at other institutions they will interview you then
and uh so that ' s way you have uh choice anyway you have
seen her 
so that day we have seen two and uh so we have plenty of time
meeting each one and this one that we are favour of
uhm she ' s a graduate from a fresh graduate from baptist
 uhm ba honours in translation
uh we are in favour of her because i think she was quite uhm
she ' s very young to me very fresh
and uhm i don't know how she can be compared
i mean terrance can tell uh to the other candidates but that that
day she ' s quite i would say uhm quite honest quite uhm willing to work
and uhm
 
 uhm 
 okay
