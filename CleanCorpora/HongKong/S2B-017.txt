good evening
hanoi has agreed to take back up to fifteen hundred vietnamese
boatpeople from hong kong each month 
that ' s according to a member of an omelco group currently on a
fact-finding tour of vietnam 
returning to hong kong ahead of her omelco colleagues legislator
peggy lam said starting in july hanoi is prepared to receive up to six
flights of two hundred and fifty boatpeople each month 
that ' s fifteen hundred compared with the peak return from hong kong
of fourteen hundred boatpeople last november 
lam quoted hanoi officials and say they too are eager to accept even
more returnees but would need money to build new transit centres 
there ' s also talk now of sending the boatpeople back in ships in
the future 
problems still plague the returnees according to lam 
the unemployment which drove many of them to flee in the first place
 still dogs them 
but international aid programs are helping train returnees in new
skills and loaning them money to start businesses 
the united states has relaxed its ban on unhcr to spend its
donations on vietnam and the expected lifting of the us trade embargo next
year will be a big economic boost 
rehousing returnees and educating their children are other problems
and lam was told of a fourth sexual diseases among female
returnees which vietnamese officials said reflected the promiscuous life
in hong kong ' s boatpeople camps 
lam said all concerned were relieved that only seven
boatpeople had fled to hong kong this year 
to further alleviate the problem hanoi urged hong kong people
to invest in vietnam preferably in joint venture factories textiles

the government plans to step up controls on ozone layer depleting

 as carmen luk reports measures are now being prepared to
regulate the use and disposal of chloro-fluorocarbons commonly known as cfcs
hong kong consumes six hundred metric tons of cfcs each year
 mainly for the maintenance of air-conditioners and refrigerators 
at present technicians simply release any leftover chemical into
the environment before refills 
this kind of uncontrolled discharge of cfcs will have to stop
 
see cfc is still available in large quantity
and uh are much cheaper than the substitute chemical
they prefer to buy it to rent it away to discharge it to the open
atmosphere
uh it is for this reason that uh we are uh thinking of uh
stepping up enforcement and the control by banning atmospheric renting on top
uh of a proposed tax system 
in the meantime a company is preparing to collect unwanted
cfcs for recycling and then sell them for about two-thirds of the normal
price
but until the new tax on imported cfcs and new controls on
disposal are in place the company does not expect its merchandise can beat
imported products which still come cheap

at an open forum a leader of the united democrats yeung sum
 argued that the multi-seat-single-vote system was devised to stop its
group from winning the majority of elected seats 
in nineteen ninety-one voters were entitled to pick two candidates
in each constituency 
the liberals ran for both seats and took them all 
under the proposed multi-seat-single-vote system voters would pick
one candidate in spite of the fact that there would be two or more seats
apart from the overall winner remaining seats would be filled by candidates
who came in second and third place in each constituency 
ronald arculli convenor of the legco exco group on the electoral
system defended the proposal and pointed out the shortcomings of the
existing system
 
if you had uh a block vote which means that uh those getting
sixty percent let ' s say come from the same party you would then have three
persons from the same party getting sixty percent of the vote and only
representing therefore sixty percent of the voters 
the government has not indicated its stand on the proposal
saying that it will be subject to consultation
