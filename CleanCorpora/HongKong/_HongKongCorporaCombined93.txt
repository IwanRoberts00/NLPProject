well i ' m in a public school right now public school the private school there ' s a lot like   but still you know i ' ve been checking out the information even the uc berkeley i mean the uc berkeley is a a public school right sort of berkeley is a public school yeah it ' s in san francisco yeah i know it is uhm it ' s it ' s in san francisco uh right somewhere in california anyway so it is uhm it it   it ' s right next to san francisco it ' s just right next to san i see where is it i think you get you get get to berkeley just by passing the uhm san francisco downtown really downtown san francisco i was there i couldn't i was off the bridge i was there i couldn't i don't know uc berkeley was there right it ' s right there oh all right pretty close okay people people in san francisco are very very nice you might probably like it there i i know i ' ve been there i like it there yeah compare with miami people are just mean here really yup why ' s that well first of all they just mostly they don't speak english they don't speak english yeah they speak spanish oh shoot even in even in florida i ' m talking about miami the older crowd right i mean the younger generation of course they speak spanish of of course there ' re some some you know some here that doesn't speak english but uhm three words   uhm uhm  okay and they tend you know spanish people they tend to tend to hang over with spanish people so   oh  you know the worst thing ever heard is that what that they like miami uh uh it ' s close to the it ' s close enough to the state okay so how bad is that i mean you are in fucking in in in in the states but yet you have you know tut yeah yeah you mean they like so where like miami uh huh cos that ' s close enough to the united states but the thing is  right   miami is in the states i guess you ' re not getting it oh ho ho ho i ' ll see oh i think you see it ' s like saying you like hong kong uh huh cos it ' s close enough to china okay i got it i got it uh so ironical so where actually is so this uhm uh uhm those uhm spanish speaking people are from mexico right uhm south america south oh   they usually go to south  that ' s right   uhm so mexican they usually go to la oh no wonder yah there ' re so many mexican people there yeah but   yah even in san francisco   but  the difference between the difference between mexican in la uhm uhm to south american in miami is that mexican actually respect the american culture enough to speak english i   okay  i mean at least they will try to speak english right but here if they don't feel like learning it they are not going to learn it oh shoot so what they offici   mostly i hate i hate miami i don't even know why i ' m here now i can't wait to get out i really want to get out of here in two years oh did i tell you that i ' m going to rome rome rome italy uhm when uhm f fall fall two thousand and three  f what two thousand and three yes that ' s this year yeah i ' m gonna be there for a semester going from uhm september to december you go there for exchange it ' s not exactly an exchange cos it j a study abroad programme wow cool man it ' s it ' s like what from but i don't think any italian would like to come to miami uh well uh well y   miami has nothing miami has nothing but beaches oh i mean it ' s a good place to uhm for vacation but it ' s not a good place to live and
