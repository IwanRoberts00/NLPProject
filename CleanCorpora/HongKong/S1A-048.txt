 
""
did you have your examination this morning 
""
""
uh  afternoon twelve ten
 
""
what  what is it about 
""
""
uh eas course
""
i think  because you are visiting student so you don't need to
attend that course
""
  all the  first year student have to
""
this is uhm  uh a course for to enhance your english ability 
to produce a good essay 
""
a good essay means which is academic  with uhm  the academic
research
""
well researched  and the materials is well organised and have
your own comment and argument and with  uh the material support your 
argu  uh  uh argument 
""
that is the objective of the course
 
""
 that  ' s right  
""
oh so what are you writing about 
""
""
uhm
 
""
what are you writing about 
""
""
write  uh i have write four four essay this year
 
""
four 
""
""
yeah four
""
two for each term  and  i have write on family in japanese
system
""
it is uhm  the to uh presentation essay  and i have write a
 a theme report uh based on  any theme i i i like and then write a
report but should be academic  but i don't think my essay is academic
enough 
$z laughs 
""
and in the first term i write uhm  the  the crime the uh the
causes of crime  and it  ' s also a  presentation essay and the previous
one is uhm  what  ' s that
""
i forgot 
""
total four essays   and 
 
""
 so   what are you doing this afternoon 
""
""
it is oral examination because we uh beside the academic essay
produce we should have a academic a uh discussion
""
oral discussion    based  on  a materials and
read it drop notes and then discuss with your  classmate   
""
""
should be academic
""
so all the thing you you are you talking or you uhm deliver to the
 one-word  uh people should have some material support
based on the articles
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 oh  
""
is it good 
""
""
uh i think the uhm  essay is better because i i 
""
 one-word  maybe maybe we are in music
department because  so we don't have a lot of chance to discuss our 
our our our our course  recording-level-drops 
""
""
so  i think the  uh essay part is useful
 
""
yeah 
""
""
but  one-word  more than the oral part
 
""
uhm  but you think it  ' s useful
""
the course is useful 
""
""
yes useful
 
""
ah good
""
i might have to do it next year 
""
cos i  ' m gonna to be a full-time student i hope 
""
   two-words   
""
""
 maybe   you you can ask  uhm uh student  ad
 admission office or or the arts faculty to  uh say you are visiting
student but you are now transferred to a regular student
 
""
i   have 
""
i have 
""
but  but you know it  ' s a lot of  bureaucracy so they have
to approve
""
 multiple words 
""
let  ' s see what happens 
""
""
 you did
""
you did  
""
how is the progress in  transfer to uh to be a regular student
 doing
 
""
i don't know 
""
i have no idea 
""
""
should be  have a result after the examination
 
""
yeah
""
 two-words  yeah i think so and and also 
they say it depends on on my results in the examination 
""
""
i think you   would not have a big problem 
 
""
 if they  ' re really bad     laughs  they  ' re
really bad they won't accept me 
""
""
because i remember i received the confirmation for   
 uh admit the university rather late in uh the beginning of september
last year
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
oh really 
""
""
yeah and it is september september eighth    
and i come to take my confirmation letter in person because i i am afraid
they will uh some mistake in the mail   so  maybe you should 
 contact  them and always telephone the arts faculty and ask what  ' s
the result what  ' s going on then  tha  they will be  more efficient
on your progress
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
yeah maybe maybe 
""
""
because if it is too late it it is very difficult to
considerate what  our planning is
 
""
uhm uhm
""
so how are you uh
""
have you done your specimen paper yet  for techniques 
""
""
specimen what
 
""
specimen paper 
""
""
  uh 
 
""
 do   you remember the assignment 
""
""
uh you mean chan kam biu
 
""
pardon
""
yeah
""
  yeah
""
yeah  
""
""
 chan kam biu one  
""
i have worked out all uh the chord  already
""
and the  outline of the uh  fifteen and twenty bars chord
progression
""
  i  haven't insert all the details notes on the score
  
""
so  i think i will finish uh tonight 
$z laughs 
""
able to
 
""
 yeah  
""
 oh i see  
""
yes 
""
""
how about you
 
""
it  ' s difficult
""
i  ' m i  ' m i have done  about half of it but i don't know how it
sounds 
""
""
you have organised all the chords already
 
""
yeah 
""
""
but uhm  you find a   little  two-words
 
 
""
 the melody   
""
""
but i i think  the  uh that way is
""
the best way is to work out the chord progression first
 
""
yes 
""
""
mr chen mr chan tell us    and 
 
""
 i   did that first but then 
""
""
the problem is how to use that 
$z laughs   s  specific chord  the   the  diminishing
 chords 
 
""
 the passing note   and everything
""
i don't know 
""
""
but i found the original sonata from beethoven 
""
uhm he used the first six bar again in the coming fifteen to
twenty bar so i also imitate the format of him
 
""
you found the original
""
oh   i  see oh 
""
""
 yeah   then but i i would not exactly copy the
six first six bar into my uh passage but   i  would use the
chord progression and  change the melody and the uh rhythmic pattern 
   so i i can work lesser than uh the  entire  everything
""
so i have the first six bar and i have work a three bar transition
to  repeat the uh first six bar and use  uh i i think i use three to
five bar to work out the uh modulation to uh c major
 
""
 uh  
""
 oh  
""
uhm
""
oh you are doing the c major 
""
""
uhm
 
""
me too
""
so 
""
""
the original passage is g major
 
""
  g major  
""
""
 not c   major or g minor
 
""
  oh really  
""
""
 so you   cannot copy exactly
 
""
oh good
""
he made sure that you couldn't copy the original  laughs 
""
so  did you go to kelina  ' s tutorial yesterday 
""
""
uh yes
""
i have taken my bartok assignment but i  ' ve got only c minus
 
""
oh 
""
""
uh i  ' ve heard from agnes you you  ' ve got a a  minus is it
 
""
how did she know
""
i didn't tell her  laughs  
""
""
maybe she have a look uh somewhere
""
ah it  ' s a minus
 
""
yeah i was lucky 
""
""
i i don't know what  ' s the difference between  a minus and
c minus because i 
""
if i have a chance to look at your uh essay then i would see what
 what  ' s the what what  ' s the uh materials i  ' ve missed in my essay so i
got c minus
 
""
yeah
""
you can you can look at it if you want to
""
i think what she like maybe was that i
""
maybe my presentation uhm i made a table so that you can compare
 the two uhm parts like violin  one and violin two  and then 
maybe that i had a very distinct idea about maybe that was it
""
cos she said that was the most important thing that you should
have a uhm special view or something 
""
""
i think my problem for not uh to get  a higher grade 
is she said i  ' ve  raised up all the  important thing but without
further elaboration about the thing  i  ' ve raised
 
""
uh yeah 
""
""
let  ' s let  ' s let say uh i found that the first violin and
the second violin is playing  a  fifth part     uh when
when they entry in the second section but i haven't tell  more detail
about this fifth part is
""
what kind of fifth is diminish fifth or augmented fifth because
there  ' s a lot of fifth a lot of type of fifth
 
""
 uhm  
""
oh i see
""
  yeah  
""
""
  one-word    something like
that so i i i i got a lower grade
 
""
i think you shouldn't be afraid of uhm  uhm  leaving out
things
""
i mean if we have a special idea  that this is the way i think
the piece works
""
if we have that idea even if it  ' s narrow and doesn't  you
know doesn't concern all the details of the piece
""
if we really uhm are convincing you know you can get away with it
    just a single idea 
""
""
 uhm  
""
and then also other kelina what will we do in the examination
""
did did you ask her
 
""
yeah we do 
""
""
she said just like  doing an assignment    
""
just like doing an assignment
 
""
 yeah  
""
she said we don't have to revise very much 
""
""
just you you you you uh can able to pass the exam just you
haven't drunk
 
""
yes she  ' s joking 
""
""
and she said uh it it will not be very difficult to you 
then i say not difficult to you but not us  both laugh  because we are
year one student
""
and i said i would me agnes and raymond have no more time to
repeat so we should have 
$z laughs   one hundred percent control
""
our result should be passed    
""
so we want to know  a lot uhm more more thing about the
examination
""
what will we do  especially the history
 
""
 nice try  
""
so which examination are you most worried about 
""
""
uh history
 
""
history 
""
""
yeah
""
i i i i  ' m not very worried about the the analysis and techniques
and the  compu  uh computer uh music application
""
uhm maybe music history sociology and computer programming in
computer science department  so   these  three course i i should
have paid  more time to  re re  uh do the revision
 
""
 uhm  
""
yes 
""
""
and history is the most difficult one  i think
 
""
maybe
""
yeah
""
i am worried about history  and technique and maybe 
computer as well because    i i have  
""
""
 you mean   music improvisation
 
""
yeah yeah
""
i have to study 
""
""
what what will you do in the score uh note processing
""
will you uh finale or score or encode
 
""
if i can choose  in  one-word  
""
""
he said we can choose one of three
 
""
i think score 
""
""
score
""
you you familiar with score
""
i  ' m familiar with finale
 
""
maybe i don't know i don't know
""
let  ' s see 
""
i have to study them during these weeks now
""
i have time to revise look at the manuals    two-
words   
""
""
 but    but for the purpose to pass the
examination just use the most familiar one
""
but if you want to have a more convenient software to work out the
processing i think finale is the best one
 
""
yeah 
""
""
in the in the moment i know every software i think finale is
very good one     because  you remember if you type uhm 
let  ' s say five bar in first system  and you found is very tense for the
space you want to put the a fifth bar to the second system you should delete
all the  bar in  uh bar five and then type it in the second system
again
""
you see you cannot just press uh down arrow then the fifth bar
will  go to the second system
""
finale do that
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
oh 
""
""
let  ' s say
""
 b  because you type the score is a  horizontal line
   
""
it doesn't matter uh which how many system uh how many bar in the
system
""
uh after you press uhm let  ' s say  twelve bar  then you tell
uh the system you want four measure in the system then  phone rings 
automatically automatically the uh system will help you to  put four
measure in the system four measure in the system then you want the three
system
""
and if just uh say the introduction only  uh have uh three
measure and the four the fourth bar is  below the beginning of the first
verse so you press down arrow then all the fourth bar would go to the second
system    
""
it  ' s very convenient
 
""
 yes  
""
 oh  
""
uhm uhm sorry   a long pause 
""
""
how long should we talked
 
""
 speech inaudible  
""
""
yeah mr chan  ' s uh tutorial
 
""
yeah  yeah 
""
""
i i have to  get a remind what time is it
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
""
 four words  when you had tutorial with kelina
 did she speak english or cantonese to you 
""
""
english
 
""
english 
""
""
all all our group is uh chinese betty raymond and me but she
also say uh english
 
""
uhm 
""
""
i think  in the university all all the lecturer and  uh
uh tutor is exception
""
uh lecturer will is also saying is always saying english to the
student
 
""
yeah 
""
""
but i think it is uhm uh culture or   communication
""
 
""
 regulation     sort of  
""
""
i am not sure it  ' s a regulation
 
""
uhm yeah i think so 
""
""
even the last lecture in chan kam biu you are absent and uh
in your
""
it  ' s uh it  ' s well    one-word   he
also say in english
 
""
  one-word   
""
oh he speaks english 
""
""
yeah
 
""
oh right
""
oh really 
""
""
not not for because you you are are foreigner you you don't
know cantonese so  s  they speak english
""
i think in the other department and especially in the eas course
after the lecture or the class the tutor or the teacher is also is always
saying english to us
 
""
uhm 
""
""
no cantonese
 
""
but this it  ' s better for you to know more english because uhm it  ' s
better to to have an international education 
""
i think so for myself as well because if i was to study in
swedish i would study 
""
""
but i have a classmate she went to  jap  uh japan for
the uh five-year degree course
""
 two words  she originally is the foreign
student in this university
""
she got the full scholarship from the japanese government so
 
""
really 
""
""
yeah
""
and she said she will do japanese communication and japanese essay
in the japanese university
 
""
in  jap  in japanese 
""
""
yes no english
 
""
but  but that  ' s japan
""
i mean hong kong is such a small place and i mean internationally
it  ' s very important to know english so i think i think it  ' s important 
""
i remember in the beginning mr chan said  oh i have to speak
english oh you know
""
he didn't like it very much but  but maybe now he  has 
 got used to  
""
""
 but hong kong   is not a  in  uhm
independent country or independent city
""
it  ' s a colonial of british    so   english is 
more important
 
""
 yeah  
""
exactly but for being a british colony i don't think people speak
very good english here   three words  
""
""
 but in the  gov    in the government in
the government department all the communication is uh english   
uhm  because in the early time of hong kong the trading with the uh
foreign country like like the france and and other country is also using
english because hong kong is the place uh under   britain  so
 i think the importance of english is  the reason behind this
 
""
 that  ' s right  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yeah  but uhm like indian  people  they  s  they
 s  sometimes speak english to each other 
""
""
uhm
 
""
uhm they have been a british colony for a very long time as well
but they speak better english than the  chinese in hong kong usually 
""
""
indian have a better standard
 
""
yeah 
""
""
i think may may be
 
""
maybe because they have several indian languages so they need a
common language uhm 
""
""
i don't know  how did they  teach english to the in the
primary school or in the uh people when they are childhood time
""
  i think  uhm  because in hong kong or uh chinese
is is  an exception
""
uh hong kong  we start to uh learn english in around uhm
primary one i think  phone rings  except some kindergarten they have
english course   phone rings  otherwise we  ' ll all all the student
is uh ordinary will  learn english in primary school when they are primary
one so
""
and the  method of teaching english is to know the vocabulary
first and know the grammar and  it it not have quite uh  man  many
chance to speak    and  uh what is it
""
because uh the teacher is also use cantonese to teach english
""
  so i think  it is  it doesn't provide a a very
good place or environment for student to practice their english  
throughout  their their learning  so it is  the reason maybe the
hong kong  people have a a uh not very good standard in english ability
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 oh really  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm that  ' s right
""
so  so what do you think about uhm  all the expats all
the foreigners that come to hong kong to work 
""
""
 two words 
 
""
all all   the foreigners   that come to hong kong to
work like all the americans and things like that 
""
what do what do chinese people think about that in general 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm you mean we refuse or or accept
""
 
""
uh sort of
""
yes yes 
""
""
uh i have i i i don't think it it have a influence to local
people very much because uhm  beside the foreigner that  ' s it from uh
america or britain we have foreigner from chinese   because  we
we are hong kong citizens we have some chineses  coming to hong kong and
find their job     even the uh high-profile or low-profile
job
 
""
 yes   
""
 yeah  
""
uh uh 
""
""
uh it it cannot say the foreigner affect hong kong
""
 in   in  instead the chinese people also so we we
cannot say uh  uh  hong kong citizen have a uh have  le le 
lesser working uh chance in hong kong because the foreigner come to uh take
our job away
 
""
yeah that  ' s right
""
but still i think  it seems that uhm chinese people in hong
kong or hong kong chinese     have a negative attitude to
foreigners 
""
would you agree with that 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uh what attitude
 
""
a negative attitude to foreigners  in general 
""
""
uhm  maybe i am not a foreigner so i have no experience
about this but personally i  haven't aware that uh chinese people have
negative  attitude to foreigner 
""
maybe i am not i don't have   so i don't  so i i i
haven't aware uh some people around or uh the chinese people have a negative
attitude
 
""
 no no  laughs   
""
uh 
""
""
what kind of attitude do you think
 
""
uhm 
""
""
it  ' s exactly a discrimination or just a attitude or  
 or  something  like that
 
""
 uhm  
""
a bit uhm a bit of fear maybe 
""
""
fear
 
""
being   afraid  
""
""
 fear   to fear to talk with the foreigner
 
""
yeah 
""
""
oh
 
""
and also maybe afraid because  we look different  we are
different  we say different things
""
i don't know     different culture and  and
also  probably it  ' s a lot because chinese people are shy to speak
english or     a lot uhm a lot of the uhm
""
and uhm  i don't know maybe they think that  sometimes i
think  that they look down on the foreigners 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
look down
 
""
yeah sorry 
""
""
 multiple words 
""
i think the chinese people or hong kong chinese is not uh look
down
""
i think in personal idea that they are not look down
""
they  really they are afraid because uhm the i i think the
reason is  the uhm guess their english ability is not good enough to
communicate with the foreigner    
""
uh as uhm even they are speaking english or not   
""
""
maybe they speak uhm mandarin
""
i i  al al  always afraid how to speak with them because my
mandarin is not very good so uhm  in the chinese culture i i i think 
they afraid the foreigner but they don't look down on the foreigner because
uhm in some  uh hotel or some shop if the foreigner come in they will have
a very  uhm bad bad service for the foreigner    but  they
cannot find it in the uh uh chinese themselves
""
maybe let  ' s say uhm  uh foreigner spirit is i go to the
spaghetti house     and there  ' s full full house and i waited
for the uh empty place or or or or a table for uh  aro  or we have uh
two persons table for two then the foreigner come in  she go to open the
door  for the foreigner but not for chinese    
""
 three words  for the chinese if foreigner come
in they will open the door   but  not for chinese
""
i think how come
""
we are chinese but you you
""
  i think  should be equal service or or should have
uh equality but   we  doesn't find that  e  equality but
foreigner is better
""
  find  it quite absurd
""
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 really  
""
 yeah  
""
 okay  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
