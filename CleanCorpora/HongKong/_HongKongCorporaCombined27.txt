  uh   two-words can be   it could be a uh maybe that hong kong is actually more traditional some how than shanghai where shanghai really i mean okay hong kong is an international city but it ' s not it ' s not as international as westerners think it is  but shanghai they really do look the outside but the other mainlanders found just to some extent maybe mainland is found the shanghaiese  more foreign than the foreigners sometimes i heard people say that  uhm people a friend of mine from uhm  two- words or beijing those two-words  we we were sitting in a table with shanghainese around  and foreigners and their group said yeah the the shanghainese just seem more foreign to that as a foreigners maybe maybe the shanghainese is different but but anyway i found that reason two-words  or mainlander maybe just in hong kong   yeah   yeah   uhm uhm  i think uh uh hong kong people got a long ship culture of tradition uh working hard have have to work hard long working hour so it just keep themself clear    they will not they will not try to not sociable because they they will not think about the others there ' s maybe some too independent sometime or selfish or sometime people will always say hong kong people are selfish but shanghai people maybe they got a chance to  talk to the the others for the oversea they will treasure the chance    uhm uhm  yeah oh yeah maybe but uh uh yeah maybe hong kong people just very keen to know about what they ' ve spent their time on two-words  they can't see any immediate value i mean i ' ve i ' ve found i got a bit that way myself but i i ' ve found it very hard to make time with people in friends i mean chinese friends uh uh from the mass majority of my friends i don't but i ' ve got to two-words i got good friends i just can't see them for months because i think it ' s i just find it harder and harder to make time to see people   yeah one-word   i have the same problem with my friends too   yeah  i seldom see them because we ' re busy too busy   yeah  because i have to work here you know i have to  handle   uh   one-word my studies   and  laugh  right you ' re   i don't think hong kong is a city like  uh as open as foreigners think  uh i think it ' s somehow link with the history  and for hong kong hong kong is like always open so people don need to catch these moments to to open to the foreigners speak to them  but for shanghai they just like  for ten years ten years time so they will catch it the moment     uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm     still one-word yeah  but   yeah  and i think uh some traditional thinking chinese one survive better here in hong kong than in mainland yeah because yeah the the hong kong people stay together as a group but they seldom uh see the outside world because they get everything without fighting for it like the mainland chinese so they don need to open their eyes so they don open their eyes and that ' s why    uhm uhm   yeah  right so you think uh think hong kong people are getting soft now  because life is easy  no life life is getting harder and harder   really   yeah   uhm  i agree  yeah yeah   getting poorer and poorer yeah few years ago i have been to italy and for an exchange programme and i i ' ve known some some youngster among same age as me and i i really feel that they really have the world vision  that the hong kong youngster don don don possess yeah that ' s that ' s pity because i don think i think i think hong kong people is somehow lost in this city   with everything like movies and just they just want to fit in everything into their into the twenty four hours and they try to make use make most of it but and finally they they get lost so it ' s like  they don treasure like uhm peace or they don really know what what what it is so  uhm  p e a peace   laughs  alright i  two-words   two-words  because i don't know how the   ,  and  laugh  yeah uhm why you choose this course linguistic only study in the university i one-word think many people study this course you mean english yeah  linguistics or english  one-word  both i mean i think you study linguistics yeah   linguistic i ' m going to quit   ,  and  laugh  we three-words a long pause  you mean english subject is not popular in university is it popular no i think she means linguistics or english   eng   english is  okay  i think english is quite popular no i don't think so i think so because you have different varieties of english different  course   uh different courses too  yeah  professional english for translation  yeah   no the major   oh   but it ' s   bba should be more popular bba uh should be more    bba   but you have to com  compare with the mainstream   business uh bachelor in business administration yeah it is because in hong kong people like to take bu business class and can get a good job    bachelor of business and administration okay  you ' re majoring in business   yeah uh marketing  yeah   uh two-words on on the mtr in in most of time recent you travel around are on the mtr the underground one-word or whatever the subway you see people reading  uhm hong kong you don't see people reading  unless either they are bored  or they are reading uh cartoon book   two-words   uhm   excuse me   and  laugh  or the love story from taiwan one-word      yeah you rarely rarely see people actually reading  a book now uh i ' m how it mean i mean i don't know how much they use to read in chinese in contemporary literature so novel and so on i mean i mean now you see a few because in in the uk or the us yeah though good novels and or a non-fiction thing printed yeah all all the time i don't know to what extent that ' s true if it was chinese language is is it uh   uhm uhm  do you know how how for example for the student in hong kong how har hard they work how uh the workload is really heavy for school work  i don't think they will after school that oh read the book on the mtr they will not do that but people go to work they will rather sleep while they are standing up   holding the handle but they can still sleep     because they work too hard they will not read the book they think    uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   yeah   yeah     yeah   uhm uhm  when when they have time they will go for the entertainment for example the karaoke or to   ,  and  laugh   disco   yeah the karaoke   so you drink    so reading is not is not a sort of past time   in hong kong   it ' s not  no not not two-words  only some uh now love story  don point to me all speakers laugh  no it should be love story uh all speakers laugh    why should she point to you   laughs  you have read those  those love story     you read you read love love story   uhm really the english patient but for the course   for the course uhm    uh   yeah  do you enjoy that  no too much history in the book i don't like it because i don know much history in western   uhm uhm yeah   one-word  do you want to go to somewhere overseas the oversea country to live there one-word  for few years to understand the culture there the history there  if you have a chance  uhm  yeah i think i ' ll like it   yeah you ' ll miss hong kong  i ' ll miss my parent okay and my friends   yeah and hong kong  yeah  not hong kong   people not the place     okay   yeah the place terrible for the like   uhm   sometime it ' s terrible yeah you just we just have two ho two two holidays like the weekend i mean and you you can go nowhere    and and i think it ' s terrible    right   uhm uhm  uhm uhm in hong kong sometime people just don't want to go to any  anywhere one-word   yeah i love to hide myself at home when i have the holiday   don't several words  all speakers laugh  uh yeah i understand don't want to see anyone  two-words     but do you uhm one-word  do you find the western some of the western attitudes strange like the in the lesson  uh uh yeah   i mean for example people leave leave home when they are sixteen eighteen whatever and they they never go back i mean i ' ll go back to visit maybe once a year or several years month but   just one you think   yeah   maybe maybe if they don't need to give any money to the family   yeah that ' s right it ' s their own life and they go they do it and yeah sure there is a problem they go out but uhm really they ' re that ' s it at eighteen they go and uhm  they ' re the they are on their own   uhm  yeah uhm    do you find it strange   i think  yeah strange strange yeah as chinese we have to pay our family when we got the work we have to pay our family ev every month give them some money because i ' ll have to now you got the world  we have to give the money back to one-word  the parents some kind of this traditional feeling   but when you say you have to you mean okay i un i understand that it ' s it ' s basic but do you do you feel that something that  you ' re forced to do or something that that you accepted as normal   you think   yeah   you are forced to do it i feel if if i think i need not to give the money to them i ' ll oh happy days   and  laugh  will you will you give it to them if you are not forced do you think you are forced to give it to them yeah i think if i said can i stop paying you money and they will went crazy i think the what what  what ' s wrong with you something like  that    but you   okay  it ' s not my business but today do you give does does it usually happen that people give money to their parents  because their parents need it or because it ' s just a tradition   yeah  yeah i think i think for some families it ' s because they need the money the parents need the money because no mpf before  yeah so they need the money but for some one-word some people i think  it ' s a tradition because i know someone uh some family they are really rich the parents are so rich ri not to work anymore play golf ev everyday but they still get the money from for example they they they move to canada now they are now living in canada but their their children will keep pay keep paying money to the parents not much maybe just one thousand or two thousand for just it means our to take care of it  one-word     uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   so sym symbol symbolic  yeah yeah i think so    okay  actually i ' ve internalize this idea that i have to pay money to them when i ' m working  i i don't think i ' m force uh maybe it ' s because the responsibility that i have been internalized but i don see any problem in that     uhm uhm  but because i think most important thing is we are now still studying as in as school when you go out to work you found out you have to pay everything for yourself the living everything so at the time the credit card bill come every month you will think oh if i need not to pay my parents will be perfect  you will think in this way because you got the pressure  and in uh   maybe i will think so but i still think it ' s my responsibility to give the money to them   yeah   yeah it ' s not the res  uh i don't think i am forced i think i am forced i think i am   i know the feeling because you will got the pressure you see you know if you do not do this someone will not happy     uhm   one-word   you do feel bad  do you feel bad i ' m i ' m happy to do that if i can make them happy but this doesn't mean i am so happy to do this because  it can make them happy   because in terms i will be happy because i don i will be trouble free yeah     this   happy     yeah   okay  i mean if you parents are rich i don't know if they are or not but uh if they were would you feel that would you resent having given them money or not   i will but not that much   you given  is that two- words  okay   if they are   yeah  i don't one-word they tell me they are not they are not rich i don't know actually all speakers laugh  if they are richer i think i i need the pressure will not be so so heavy  even though maybe uhm you know the econ economic in hong kong the economy is not very good  two years ago many people are they loss their job they still have to take care of their family maybe the parents maybe they got a family you got a family already to two-words the family and also the parent so people are  like  yeah in trouble few years ago they loss their job they will oh two-words  in a trouble    yeah   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm yeah   uhm uhm  my my mother is uh seventy nine this year  you one-word you know how much money i have given her in her life time   uhm uhm   and  laugh  really   that is  oh you are bad boy   i ' m sure  she wouldn't she wouldn't i got to buy her a a house  i got to buy her also something   uh she won't take it  she ' s very independent it ' s so the youth in in the west of the uk works both ways and the independence is on both sides uhm you know if she was homeless i would say she would accept my help uhm but uh one-word she she has a a small income she has savings she has two pension one from her job one from the government  uhm i say that both from the govern one-word because she taught she was a teacher that that   one- word in the in the one-word  college  and she has very simple needs she has a a very nice apartment that ' s not expensive  and uhm she doesn't need anything she goes on holiday twice a year and she wouldn't she wouldn't take me   oh   two-words   you know   yeah   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm  uhm uhm i think i know several words  i think a hong kong chinese or most of the chinese it ' s a culture they think i got a children it ' s a kind of investment  when they grow up they will give me the money or i don't need to work  one-word twenty years later after their graduation they finish studying go to work i do not work so i get the money from the children i think it goes in this way    uhm uhm  i think because in in west in the west you you have the idea that uh individual as a unit but in hong kong the family is the unit yeah  uhm   so  most of family very strong so it ' s it ' s different like the unit the the family is a whole and   right but it ' s uhm is that i mean the family typically or uh one-word i believe that the family typically will meet re  relatively often may maybe once a week or more than once a week   two or three times a week  one-word not everyone does but uhm i have a feeling just looking at in the outside from the western point of view i look at i i i just have a feeling that they  you keep that so tight because you are afraid that it will fall apart if you don't keep it so tight  you know if if if if you got a habit for few weeks of not meeting twice a week  pe people might think  hey world goes on and i shall have more time for myself this this is good  and so it ' s a reluctance to one-word  go one little bit to re to relax it one little bit  because the whole thing may not to be  one-word   because the whole thing may just get  one-word gone i think there ' s a fear that in in fact the whole thing will will fall apart if you relax it   uhm   uhm   uhm   uh   uhm   uhm   uhm   i think it ' s happen mostly in talking about boyfriend and the girlfriend the girl said why does i see you today everyday and the boyfriend said no no i enjoy going out on my own   oh i won't see the other girl on my all speakers laugh  oh yeah yeah so to get crazy of the other problems   ,  and  laugh  yeah   i just have a just a feeling that that ' s sort of  this ' s a it continues itself because as as the generations come up each one has what to say keep hold keep that tight hold on the next generation and not let them go  was uh it could it could let ' s go on it won't come back together again  i mean you couldn't in the uk you couldn't recreate that family you know the so call family values it ' s couldn't come back because you ' ll have to justify it  one-word it ' s someone insists to start with you don't have to justify you have to just you would have to justify change so to change back to family value in uk to tight family unit you can't say woo why is it good you know we do it good cause you said we are here you you have to tight family one-word  and it ' s you have to justify it anyway   uhm uhm  but i think it ' s partly because the older generation want the sense of being taking care of  because i live with my grandmother in quarry bay   she will be angry with uh when her  chil her daughters or her sons uh haven't call  call her for a long time because she need the sense of uhm tut being  taking care or the telephone rings     uhm uhm   uhm     uhm   uhm     uhm  very busy uh   uhm  they would like the sense of security when she came to receive a call from her sons or the daughters  what will happen to me uhm if you don  call me you don know if i ' m dead or if i have some accidents   you just don know  so you have to call me or visit me  uhm   uhm     yeah  uhm uhm     uhm  uhm my yeah my parent always said that oh you almost out now so i ' m i ' m living with with your father here only my mum always say that one day if i die in this house no one will know that maybe we ' ll know it two months later you ' ll come uhm uh it ' s time to come go to see the mum so open the door you find i i ' m they are away she always say that because they are very fear of being alone lonely  because chinese culture they uh the big family will live together in a big house one-word   uhm     uhm depressed   uhm   uhm uhm  yeah yeah a hundred of years ago one-word you still have this one-word  if the son and their si daughter-in-law can meet with uh with them they will be very happy but they woulds keep complaining about the daughter-in-law oh you are not good you are not good and also one-word    and  laugh  yeah but do you think family is a kind of support to many hong kong people  if they got problems it were in money i ' m not i mean they will think yeah the one who will not leave me will not run away is my family my parents at that point they will but  uhm uhm  so when when they don't have problems they don't go back to their parents they know they i think they know that they understand they are very good they are caring of us but they will not uh i think they know two-words love my you know cause just like the westerners they  one-word say oh mum i love you we will not do that  uhm   i do it today  two-words   ,  and  laugh  mum mum i love you oh i can't i never do it i will not do it for the rest of my life i  think   i asked her   right  have you ever hugged her uh when i was a little girl i think i did   and  laugh  but now no i think my mum will try to hug me i say oh what are you doing  yeah
