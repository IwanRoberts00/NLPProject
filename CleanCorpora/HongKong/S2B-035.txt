first of all may i take this opportunity to wish you all a very
happy season  ' s greetings
""
traditionally christmas is a season of joy in a time to show our
care for others
""
and there is also an exciting moment for children as they listen to
stories over the christmas holidays and also wait impatiently to open up
their christmas gifts on boxing day
""
as usual the questions  one word  the story of is
there santa claus  comes up now and again
""
and so the story goes and eventually the famous ending is yes
virginia there is santa claus
""
nah similar question and story on securities trading by banks as
exempt dealers also raise concerns of fairness by the securities industry in
the past many years
""
the question being  is there fair competition if banks are to
trace securities as exempt dealer
""
and the story goes like this
""
a long long time ago  banks were not allowed to be stock brokers
or to provide securities trading services
""
since banks do get involved in handling securities during their
normal course of business and exempt dealers status was therefore added to
the relevant ordinance
""
this exempt dealer status was considered fair as banks were not
able to establish their own securities trading business
""
as time moves on  the restriction of banks to trade securities
was lifted
""
and some of the banks in hong kong gradually establish their own
securities trading subsidiaries
""
uh call to repeal the exempt dealers ' status was made when the
industry again in early nineteen eighty seven
""
but unfortunately  the government was too busy to recover from
the nineteen eighty seven market collapse and in the restructuring of the
securities and future  ' s markets
""
from then on the securities industry face with an unfair
competition from banks as an exempt dealer
""
that is operating outside the securities trading subsidiaries uh or
without the appropriate subsidiaries
""
to provide comfort to the securities industry  the government
promise to review the famous of the exempts dealer status and to repeal the
same and an appropriate time
""
and so the  crowd dispersed  and wait and wait and wait
""
over the last few years  the government has worked on a
composite bill with an aim to consolidate some ten ordinances relating to
securities and future trading
""
a securities and future view was finally  gazetted 
""
recently with two volumes in a total of over eleven hundred pages
""
this masterpiece was labeled by some as one of the largest piece of
work on a single ordinance in the history of hong kong
""
anyone with a reasonable sense would expect that the exempt dealer
status would be repealed at this time
""
but no no no
""
to the disappointment of all it is still there
""
for fairness  '  sake  why is it still there
""
the government respond that it is necessary because the banks 
when trading securities are providing such services would be exempted from
the direct supervision of the securities and future commission  a normal
supervisor body to the securities and future trading
""
instead they will be supervised by a new  supervision team at
the hong kong monetary authority
""
the government claim that the banking ordinance would be amended to
the effect that the requirement and rules governing the securities trading
would also apply to the banking sector
""
the government assured that this is fair
""
or is it
""
believing such assurance to quote chairman  gong jaahk mahn
  these cantonese words refer to jiang zemin who is the general
secretary of the communist party of china  famous words is too simple and
naive
""
it is hard to believe that two independent supervisory bodies with
two different ordinances can operate fairly on the same type of securities
trading services
""
common sense tells us that it is only fair if this securities
trading services be supervised by one supervisory body with one set of
ordinance
""
repealing the exempt dealers status would be the best and the only
way to ensure a fair competition in securities trading activities
""
only with this can we believe that hong kong has a fair competition
environment
""
and be properly recognized as an international financial center
""
 have a heart  and  sh  show that you care mr
authority
""
show us your christmas spirit mr authority
""
surprise us with the gift mr authority
""
after all this is christmas
""
and so hopefully the story goes
""
they live happily ever after
""
and yes virginia  there is finally fair competition in hong kong
on securities trading
""
with this remarks i wish you all a prosperous new year and the very
best in the twenty-first century 
""
""
""
dear marianne i was delighted to see you again after all these
years
""
when we met in festival walk earlier last month and talked about
hong kong politics i suddenly realized that our positions had just reversed
""
while before nineteen ninety seven it was me who endlessly ask you
your views on the latest developments in hong kong when i came back on
holiday now it was your turn to do the same thing after the change over
""
has an experienced public relations professional you naturally pay
most attention to the failures of the sar government in getting its messages
across to the people
""
in our conversation i remember you pointedly raise a very
interesting question about our chief executive mr tung chee hwa
""
you ask how come mr tung hardly got any credit when his government
had done something right
""
but almost inevitably took most of the blame when he got himself
into trouble
""
of course we did not accept explanation put forward by advocates of
conspiracy theory
""
for we learned  two-words  how popular that has
conspiracy theories tended to explain everything they in the end explain
nothing at all
""
although at the time we did not manage to come to a consensus one
thing we did agree was it must be something more than just poor personal
communication skills
""
now that when mr tung satisfaction rate amongst the hong kong
people has reached an all time low and some of our more colourful politicians
purposefully adopt the slogan down with mr tung as one of their campaign
tactics for the september legislative council election  it is perhaps
worthwhile to point it over your question again
""
it is no secret that mr tung himself does not like political
showmanship unlike the last governor mr chris patten who like kissing babies
and mingling with the people in his district visits mr tung seldom uses
opportunities like these to try to project a favourable image to the public
""
one charitable interpretation of this is that mr tung prefers to
concentrate on the substance not the presentation of his job
""
however if a dislike of political showmanship is transformed into a
disregard of proper and necessary political communication with the people
then the dangerous is not only a matter of misunderstanding between mr tung
and the public
""
more importantly one fears that government without effective
internal and external communication is anything but government by confusion
""
the recent housing policy saga in which even mr tung  ' s top
advisors and officials were not clear about the fact that he had already
abandoned the government  ' s annual target for the construction of housing
units years ago was but one extreme example
""
and the revelation that mr tung was unaware of the contact make
between his special aid and the vice-chancellor of the university of hong
kong regarding the university  ' s poll on the chief executive  ' s popularity
make one wonders whether effective internal communication is too special a
thing to exist among those in the corridor of power
""
one must admit that although hong kong is a free city it was quite
extraordinary to find that in this summer week after week thousand and
thousand of people turn to the street to voice out their discontent on
government proposed reforms
""
we are now being described as a city of protest
""
in a sense peaceful street protest in a free city should not be a
cause of concern however as any reader of the local press can tell public
perception of these appears to see it as a result of the government  ' s
failure to properly inform and to persuade the people about the benefit of
and the need for those reforms
""
i  ' m not saying that the government has done nothing to promote and
to explain her policies to the public the point is once the public is not
happy with the government  ' s proposed policy and believe that she is
incapable of effective internal and external communication  public is
content and easily turn into distrust in the executive leadership in which
the chief executive is the most prominent but politically least experienced
culprit
""
of late mr tung finally has admitted that there is much room for
improvement in the government  ' s public relations work
""
careful observers will notice that the issue of poverty has
recently come high on the government  ' s agenda
""
it seems that the chief executive has even taken a personal
interest in this and let it be known that he deeply concerns about the
situation of the poor  particularly in the aftermath of the asian
financial crisis
""
mr tung is now also more visible in the eyes of the public
""
you can see him talking to ordinary people in the districts and he
even ran to the joint admission center after the release of the hkcee result
to give encouragement to the students
""
it is important to remember that public relations work is for the
long term
""
it does not work if you only come to it in crisis
""
you have to stick to it both think and thin
""
a recent letter to the editor of the south china morning post
rightly remind the government that she must conduct her public relations in a
planned sustained and well-targeted manner
""
and i believe nothing short of mr tung  ' s long term commitment to
improve government public relations ' will yet minimize the possibility of
another summer of discontent to appear in the future
""
for if the highest political view is not there it is only a matter
of time for the government  ' s communication missionary to crumble into pieces
again
""
but it will be wrong to think that mr tung  ' s only problem is
public relations
""
the eminent british philosopher michael oakeshott said in his
seminal essay rationalism in politics that only the politically inexperienced
who has lost the tradition of good government requires a manual to rule
""
the fact that people need to constantly remind our chief executive
of the basic of the good public relations is only one testimony of his
political inexperience
""
the other equally clear indication of mr tung  ' s political
inexperience is his inability to separate private virtue from political
morality
""
even mr tung  ' s enemies  if credit  to his good intentions
however sympathetic critics are abided to acknowledge that mr tung appeals to
forget that in government the political dimension is unavoidable even if you
very much would like to concentrate on the so call livelihood issues
""
homing to the time constraints it would be impossible for me to
elaborate on the important distinction between private virtue and political
morality but i think the great sociologist max  one-word 
has  subsistly  point out that what is required in politics is not so
much about the ethnic of intention which places more emphasis on personal
character and  incapacity  rather good political leader must embrace
what he  ' s call the ethnic of responsibility as his first priority in which
the political leader must be responsible for delivering result in the needs
of  conflicting  demand that will bring benefits to the society as a
whole
""
in the life of this it would be appear that mr tung has got his
priorities wrong when he said that on assumption of the office of the chief
executive he said three fundamental principles for himself namely he would
not allow his private liking or interest to interfere with his judgment
""
he would have no complaint in carrying out his duties as the chief
executive and he would try hard to make sure that when looking back to the
decisions he had made in office he would have no regret at all
""
those are laudable principles from a personal perspective
""
however they are far from adequate as political principles because
in the  ram  of politics what matters most is the ability to achieve
result in a responsible open and fair manner
""
for obvious historical reasons it would not be fair to blame mr
tung for his political inexperience
""
his position and popularity are not help by the particular nature
of our executive lack political system in which it is nature for the elected
legislature which does not have the power to hold the chief executive
accountable politically to use every opportunity to to criticize the all
powerful but undemocratic executive
""
further given the fact that freedom of speech is such a secret
principle in the sar it is only right for the free press to play a critical
role against the executive for this is the way to hold the government
responsible to public opinion
""
for this reasons i believe that while good council from public
relation express like you will do much good to mr tung
""
he will remain  one-word  until his manages to
transform himself into a general politician fully appreciative of the
priority of political morality and demonstrate the ability to make our
political  high  offices both authoritative and accountable
""
i sincerely hope that such a day will come soon rather than later
