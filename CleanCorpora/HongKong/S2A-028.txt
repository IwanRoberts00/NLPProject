<I>
i don't have a prepared text because i i prefer to just
have a dialogue uh i think it ' s far more interesting that way so
if you would bear with me my uh my uh talk is a bit disjointed jumping from
issue to issue just bear with me okay cos i prefer to do it that way than
to uh read out a prepared text
because my my task this afternoon is uh i ' ve literally just came
back last night a two-week trip to uh beijing washington and london 
primarily on uh mfn issue uh beijing and washington so i can give you the
latest uh bidding edition okay
that ' s another reason why i didn't have any time to prepare any
speech but anyway i prefer to do it this way
uh as most of you uh know that uh mfn issue is a very critical issue
in the last few years because it has become highly politicised especially
in uh in the us
i don't know how much uh background you people uh sort of know about
this particular item
it ' s actually part of the trade act of nineteen seventy-four
 enacted by the us congress basically directed at armless 
countries or non-market economies countries whereby if the country does
not allow free flow of immigration of its people then uh america can use
 this mf mfn tool to uh basically force the freedom of
movement of people through this trade sanction tactic
and that is why uh recently uh some of the democratic 
politicians in the us is trying to use this it is kind of stretching the
issue a bit trying to use this tool to basically force uh human rights
development and other non-trade activities in china 
 1-word recently uh we have always been 
sort of american chamber we go on uh one mission different chambers will
will make different trips and individuals go over there to lobby 
washington
but this year for the first time we are be able to sort of
rally all the local trade organisations seven leading trade associations 
uh from the hong kong general chamber to the federation of hong kong
industries the toy council the exporters association chinese
manufacturers association and the chinese general chamber of commerce 
because i felt personally uh having worked on this for some years
 that it is far more impactful to go as a group rather than all of
us trying to visit washington and uh politicians on the hill okay get
sick and tired of uh people coming from hong kong talking on the same subject
we feel that we go together and concentrate our efforts over three
day period we will get all the appointments that we want to we want
to see but i think that it has been highly successful 
now having said that we were also advised by uh the deputy
trade representative uh us deputy trade representative number two
to carla hills mr joe massey when he was through here that
it would be better for us to also go to beijing before we arrived in
washington so that at least we can say that we are lobbying both sides
it ' s basically hong kong is playing a honest broker role
we are caught in the middle 
the issue is not directly related to us but however without that
our trade will be adversely uh affected
uh seventy percent of china ' s exports to the united states comes
through here 
it will aff affect a lot of jobs in hong kong and our
economy will be affected something like six uh five to six percentage point 
of the total gdp 
so i think it ' s a significant situation that we have no choice but
to work on it uh 
if we don't work on it and and mfn gets terminated we may be
sorry that we didn't do any lobbying work
so we decide as a group
we went to beijing first 
uh we uh managed to see uh ton zhiguan who is the number two in
 1-word which is the ministry of uh foreign trade
uh he is the one who uh negotiates on all trade issues with the
united states
so we spent an hour with him
then we had uh another session with uhm hong kong macau office
lu ping was in shanghai so we met with his deputy uh chan
zhiying and uh and also uh zhi pangfai who was uh also joined in the meeting
we uh met with them for over an hour and then followed by lunch 
now our task basically is really to tell the hong kong story on uh
how without mfn how hong kong will be affected 
that ' s number one
number two objective is really to help both beijing and
washington to better understand each side ' s position because for
example the chinese leadership as you know are made up of uh people in their
eighties
they ' ve gone through long hardship 
they ' re very very nationalistic in their thinking 
simply put 1-word their feeling is that mfn is
something that us government or us congress can either give or not give
it ' s the us prerogative to exercise that particular 
sit uh action
but to put conditions on fn mfn they feel very strongly
that then the the americans are using that as a threat on china
chinese leadership don't like that
we don't want to be threatened 
that ' s the psychology of the situation
whether it ' s right or wrong
i ' m not here to say whose position is right or whose position
is wrong 
i ' m going to share with you the position taken by beijing ' s
leadership and the position taken by the us politicians in washington and
then we ' ll try to figure out how to help 
okay the fundamental point is this psychological point of that 
chinese leadership just purely does not want to be threatened and in a way
they do have have a point
either you ' re going to give the mfn or you don't give the mfn 
because even today after uh going to war with iraq for example less than a
year ago iraq still enjoys mfn status from from washington okay
okay that ' s a powerful argument
why is it why are you picking on china all of a sudden when iraq
still enjoys mfn
so this double standard has to be understood and that ' s why the
chinese leadership is very emotional and sensitive about it 
the second point
there are really basically three major issues on this debate
number one is on on uh human rights okay
number two is on uh weapons sales okay and i ' ll explain each one of them
number three is on the trade deficit the trade imbalance between uh
us and and china
now let ' s take the trade imbalance
there ' s a great debate between the two countries on how these
trade figures are tabulated 
americans purely takes china exports in full value as their
import into the into the us
now the chinese are arguing that most of the products made in china
today use a lot of raw materials and ingredients which are originally
originated from the us coming in to china through hong kong and then value
added like for example apparel lot of the materials
actually come from from the us and then it ' s made into shirts and sweaters and
and so forth and re-exported through hong kong to the states
now you know depending on the item the cost of goods may be forty
percent sixty percent whatever it is
china feels that that should be you know included in the
calculation in order to be fair
so there ' s a debate on that trade imbalance issue
on human rights obviously we are all for human rights okay
no question about that but what we are trying to explain to uh to
the americans is that economic success and prosperity has to come ahead
of political and human rights development
not the other way round
if you look at russia eastern europe doesn't work
so therefore since china is already on the uh reform path it is
absolutely critical for for uh us to maintain our mfn status so that we
can continue to trade with china help china and its modernisation and then
in turn it will help the rest of the population in improving on human rights
and other political uh evolution
because what china ' s leadership is most concerned about is control 
when you manage one point two billion population the key is
control
now the other point is when you talk about human rights 
to be able to uh achieve okay no starvation whatsoever in china 
and have enough clothes for all the population to wear during the winter to
keep them warm it ' s basic human rights very basic and that ' s a major
achievement
because look at the starvation in russia and in ethiopia in india
bangladesh
and to manage a big population like that is very very difficult and
that ' s why the leadership is paranoid about control
that ' s one of the underlying reasons on tiananmen square incident
now i ' m not here to defend china
don't get me wrong
it was very badly handled
it was wrong but i think we need to look at the bigger picture
without getting too emotionally involved and say why is it because if if there ' s
no control in china then there is a chaos 
the refugee problem coming out of china will will make the
vietnamese refugee problem pale by comparison
okay i ' m just giving you all the arguments on one side first okay
then i ' ll go to the other side give you all the arguments
you may disagree with any of this right but that ' s okay
everybody has to have freedom of opinion 
on weapons sale i think this is very important
i ' ll tell you why later why it ' s important or maybe i should
go into it right now
china has been selling uh weapons to the middle east mainly
now as you know most of the major countries sell arms
it ' s like selling any other products
it ' s part of their trade
americas sells a lot of arms to around the world and and the
chinese position is gee uh the sales we made in arms is
is a fraction of what america is selling around the world
why are they getting so excited
well the fact of the matter is not so much the fact that they are
selling arms okay
it ' s the countries that they are selling to that is so sensitive
with washington
because china uh is reportedly to be selling to countries like syria
libya and iran which are countries that us feels are terrorist
countries and irresponsible international mem uh mem 
irresponsible members of the international community these are the countries
that are trying to de-stabilize the middle east
so that ' s why the us is saying that we don't want china to sell
arms to these countries
they don't care if china sells arms to australia or or to uh
ireland or to japan or other countries but it ' s only these countries that
they are objecting to
it ' s highly emotional in a presidential election year 
and cia is via satellite is watching the situation very closely
they ' ve got all kinds of pictures
i mean china makes one move they know
so china ' s argument is that we are we are selling very little
but americans ' point of view is that that ' s not the point 
now let ' s go to the american side 
american side as i mentioned before it is a presidential election
year where president bush his popularity is dropping very fast and it looks
like it ' s going to be a three-man race 
and the democrats obviously in a year like this will use every
possible issue or activity to get at the incumbent 
and mfn in china happens to be one of those issues because
president bush is a self-proclaimed china expert
any any time you say you are a expert in something you are vulnerable
 okay
somebody is going to attack you
but he he i mean he claims that he is a china expert he he
understands those situations
so democrats are really i mean working on him on this and
using this mfn to drive a wedge into this uh whole
political situation
now the house as you know it ' s a two-house system in the congress
you have the house of representatives with a membership john of about five
hundred or six hundred about five hundred some members and senate has one
hundred members
there ' s two two uh senators from each state 
now the point here is is uh the house in the past voting is so
lopsided in favour of condition putting conditions on it led by uh nancy
 belosi from san francisco they put all kinds of
condition on it and of course beijing reacts forget it 
we ' re not going to accept anything
from my previous comment of of they feel that this is a
threatening thing
they don't like to be threatened 
but the democrats are putting conditions 
now that has been defeated or or that has been passed
the bill passed the house easily 
it also passed the senate but you know because of the balance of
power struct uh structure in the united states government structure
it ' s the house and then the senate and then the administration which is led by
the president bush okay
so any bill that passed must pass all three 
no sources of power
president has a veto power so he vetoed
i mean president bush vetoes all these
conditioned bills
in order to override this veto they need
two-thirds majority in the senate
okay that means all he needs to do is to get thirty-four senators
to support his veto and the veto stays
