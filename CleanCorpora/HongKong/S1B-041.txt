<I>
good evening and welcome to newsline 
this evening ' s program will be divided into two parts 
in part one of our program we talk to dr ronald leung chairman of
the urban council and chairman of the board of directors of the hong kong
stadium about the opening night ' s program and about the unacceptable
noise levels which is now a matter of controversy 
then in part two of our program we talk to legislative councilor
andrew wong who is looking into the remuneration package for legislative
councilors 
mr wong is chairman of the legco subgroup that is dealing with these
matters 
but first the urban council the hong kong stadium and dr
ronald leung 
dr leung uhm were you surprised by the vehemence and the the strong
reaction to the opening night ' s program and the two pop concerts which
follow the opening of the new hong kong stadium 
yes
indeed i i ' m a little surprised by the reaction because uh
initially from the information i got uh from the video tapes provided to me
 i expected the uhm jmj show the jean michel jarre show would be much more
spectacular uh than uh it turned out to be
uhm how did you uh agree upon the uh the selection of monsieur
jarre for the opening night ' s performance because it seems to me that as
this is a hong kong stadium uhm we should have some local artists
performing along with monsieur jarre
yes indeed uhm we had an organizing uh committee for the
opening ceremony consisting of the board of governors of the hong kong
stadium and together with the chief executive officer major general uh
 guy vickers 
so uh we considered various uh possibilities about local uh
stars
we have indeed scheduled a second evening for the tvb show with
all the the local canto pop uh pop singers performing
for the first evening uh we considered several alternatives 
and we thought it might be better to have some overseas artists in for the
first evening and leaving the second night for the local artists 
so we consider several of p of uhm alternatives 
and initially we picked up jmj because uhm it ' s something
unique quite different from other overseas pop singers because uh his
technique is to use the music combined with laser and also high-level
fireworks and he has a track record of performing in beijing in nineteen
eighty-two uh in houston and uh paris
but but but it would be right to say that none of you uhm you
know members of the urban council would have heard him live in any of his
previous concerts would it not
or or or did you actually went to the trouble of
going to one of his concerts to find out for yourselves what he is capable of
 i 
well these performances were done some time ago and even before
i joined the urban council 
uh we could only depend on the tape video tapes 
uhm that is impossible
i think a very few in hong kong had the opportunity of watching the
jmj show before
uhm but but you would agree would you not that on the evening
the the performance does uh leave something to be desired
i mean he was not as good as he was in the video tape
yes
i was a little bit upset 
there ' re plenty of rooms for improvement
for example uh i ex i would have expected some
high-level firework displayed but this because of a licensing restrictions uh
that uh was missing 
and also uh the non-appearance of uh one of the famous local
singers to sing a song and one-word the previous
announcement uh to the audience
i think that ' s another disappointment but that ' s all out
of our control because we delegated this to the program organizers for that
particular evening
well the impression one gets is that it ' s put together in a
hurry and that a lot of it is half-baked 
there was not enough organization going into it 
uhm i ' m sure all these could be put right
however one thing which stood out and which you would have to
do something about you know as a matter of urgency is the unacceptable
noise level 
now next door to the stadium is the tung wah hospital and as your
you yourself is a doctor by profession you would know that this sort of noise
level would not be acceptable for patients who who are convalescent
yes indeed
in addition to tung wah tung hospital there ' s also a
saint paul uh hospitals and also many more residents on the hilltop very
nearby uh the stadium and certainly they will be affected for example
beverly gardens
so all these people should be uh taken care of their welfare should
be taken care of
and i admit that there is a uh there has been unacceptable level of
uh noise nuisance to these residents in the surrounding area
what what makes it worse of course is that the environmental
protection department did warn you about this at at an early stage 
i mean during the planning and the design of the stadium i think
the epd was brought in maybe not you know from the start not not not from the
beginning but they were brought in and they advised that the acceptable
level of these performances should not exceed sixty-five decibels
and you know on on friday and the two evenings after uhm the noise
level was as high as eighty
now the problem of noise nuisance i have to uh make the uh
actual situation very clear 
uh there are some uh urban council only took over the management
authority recording-level-drops in nineteen ninety-three late
nineteen ninety-three 
so uh in the initial stage of planning designing constructions uh
urban council did not take any part at all 
there is a steering group chaired by a steward of the jockey
club and consisting members of a uh culture and recreation branch and
also uh we had a one uh departmental staff from the usd to fit
information about the old stadium to give to the committee about the various
informations of the old stadium 
and then on this basis they plan design and that they i suppose
they had the acoustic consultants to give them advice about the design 
but for urban council we did not take part
we we ' re not trying to conduct a witch hunt you
 know
we are not trying to apportion blame 
uhm but it does seem to me that you should have been involved much
earlier than that 
uh was was this because you chose not to
 uhm 
no we were not chosen
it ' s not uh our our right to choose
i we were ch we are not chosen 
put it this way
we were not chosen to be included
but why were you brought in at a late stage in that case
now because 
 and why did you agree to be brought in at a late
 stage 
 uhm now the thing is uhm we were not involved
and it there was the central government and the jockey club partnership to
develop the project
and as in as usual in all the major venues our museums our
cultural centers uh the venue is built by the government and that after
completion of the construction hand it over to urban council for subsequent
management
so this is a routine and a tradition 
so uh it ' s uh regrettable that we we were not consulted at the
initial stage about the possible noise uh uh nuisance but
uh it ' s it ' s uh very regrettable 
 uhm 
 so so you are now left with the hot potato in your
hands
indeed
and you have to do something about this
that ' s what we are trying very hard to do 
we are not doing any uh witch hunting but uh we look positively
and in actual fact we had a meeting uh with the environmental department 
the venue managers and our departmental staff together with acoustic
consultants to work out ways and means of how to improve and how to
contain the noise nuisance within the stadium and not outside the stadium
now does that mean you are going to cut the number of pop
concerts 
does that mean you are going to restrict noise levels to sixty-five
decibels and if that is the case uh how are you going to be able to make ends
meet
how are you going to be able to make the stadium self-financing
how are you going to be able to balance the book
i ' ll tackle your question in three stages 
first i think we ' ll concentrate our efforts on abating the noise
 try to introduce various measures to contain the noise within the stadium
for example the location of stage is very important
yes
and the 
 it ' s facing the wrong direction
indeed
uh we we are contemplating putting the stage against the
mountain wall so that the sound wave will travel towards the harbour side
 and then we would put some some sort of a sound barriers uh 
 uh in front of the entrance and perhaps the stage could also be
located in the center of the field and the sound wave would travel direct
to the audience instead of hitting against the hard surface of mountain
wall and then the sound will have no way to go but to up to the residents
 uhm uhm 
that ' s going to cost a lot of money dr leung at this at
this stage 
 the location of stage does not cost 
putting a top on it may be very expensive but the location of
the stage and the placing of loudspeakers uh in in a spectator stand will
cost very little money
it ' s a matter of design
what about cutting the number of pop concerts
now failing these measures we will try very hard keep on 
continue to monitor the noise level and that if we after introducing all
these uh new abatement measures if it fails then we ' ll consider cutting
down the number of uh concerts or maybe total altogether cancel out all
the the concert bookings
uhm
there was also some concern about crowd control because
 if you know if you have a major event in the stadium on a wednesday
evening and there are race horse horse racing uhm uh over at happy valley and
if the the crowd should leave both uh areas at the same time this could
be very problematic and could be uh highly dangerous 
are you doing something about that too
 of course 
the crowd control again is a built-in problem because of the land
and the location of the stadium and its proximity to the jockey club 
and especially for the wednesday evening when the jockey
club had a race and also depeche mode the concert being held at the stadium
 so that concert had to be uh postponed for one hour on the instruction of
the police 
but the audience behaved very well very quietly 
waiting patiently for the concert to be opened but that ' s something that ' s
uh experience we learnt
outside the stadium it ' s altogether police responsibility to
control the crowd
inside the stadium i admitted that the security control uh of the
crowd of the audience should be improved 
 uhm 
 uhm 
you ' re as as i uhm mentioned in the introduction you ' re also
chairman of the board of directors in hong kong stadium
are you now worried about the income side of things
i mean if you have to cut a number of concerts
 yes 
uh if we do away with the concerts uh the income will certainly
decrease and will certainly de decrease but whether we can make
ends meet or not it will depend very much on our promotion ef 
promotional efforts of the or rather the results of our promotional
efforts 
we will promote more sport events
we will promote more other community events other not 
noi non-noise-making events uh to be held in the the stadium
 uhm 
you ' re you ' re chairman of the urban council and uh of course the
chairman of the urban council would have to look into uh all kinds of things
you have you have uh you have responsibilities but being chairman
of the board of directors of hong kong stadium is is something which you know
a a doctor is not normally required to do 
is there a conflict of interest there and would you like to pass
that over to somebody else now
uh now uhm i would like since i take up this potato
i will solve the problem before i pass it onto somebody else 
i don't want to pass a hot potato to anybody to shed my
responsibilities
and although i ' m medical in training i have but also have a
financial training so i know how to run business because in
actual fact i ' m the chairman of a local bank
 uhm 
but you ' re getting a lot of flak from your own colleagues in the
urban council and from the press at large
but in actual fact deep inside i i have a lot of sympathy
from my councilors that that they fully support me 
they ' re fully behind me and i am speaking in the open and i
hope the urban council will come forward to support me and i can count on
their support
okay
on that note we leave the program for the time being but don't go
away because in part two i ' ll be talking with andrew wong on the pay and
allowances level of legislative councillors
