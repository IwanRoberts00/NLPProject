good evening and welcome to newsline
""
my name is maureen boyd sir piers jacobs broke down his fifth and
final budget for hong kong
""
we  ' ll take a look at it with out panel of guests and our 
two-words 
""
before that a few word with t l tsim our regular commentator about
the visit uh this past week of uh lu ping and uh  three-words
 arrived last sunday friday it was that uh lu ping made his speech
to the general chamber commerce in english is very  odd  be positive
message
""
well how do you  access  their visit 
""
""
well this is of course uh uh a one great big pr exercise and i
think they have done very well
""
uhm the fact that lu ping spoke in english to the hong kong general
chamber of commerce to some of hong kong  ' s leading businessmen i think that
was well received
""
the really important point of course is what transpired in those two
or three sessions he had with the governor sir david wilson
""
because the governor left immediately for london right after  and
he  ' s probably briefing the foreign office right this moment
 
""
what  ' s your analysis what  ' s happen 
""
""
well i think some  basic point of principles are involved
and uh they exchanged views
""
and china probably offered  some solutions the way they see them
""
and uh sir david will now have to bring these  to the attention
of the foreign secretary to prepare him for the visit to peking which is
going to take place  i think within the next two months
 
""
should hong kong people feel any more reassure after uh  lu
ping  ' s visit 
""
""
if you are a business person and uhm if you want to continue
to make large sums of money then i think you probably will be encouraged by
what mr lu said to the hong kong general chamber of commerce
""
i  ' ve always taken the view that  china  ' s strategy  recently
 hong kong is  everything goes on a business fund but nothing doing on
the political fund
""
uhm and uh they they would demonstrate their hand again in uhm the
day the way they  they  ' re going to deal with uh budding local politicians
and parties
""
  they want 
 
""
 they claim it  
""
they did come in time of course to uh view the district broad
election last sunday 
""
""
uhm that  ' s not really important to them
""
the really important one is legco election in september
""
i think they would want to uhm  be able to control  uh the
media
""
they want to be able to control the hong kong alliance and other
political groupings
 
""
okay t l thanks for this
""
let  ' s uh  now turn to the hong kong budget  music and a
long pause 
""
joining us to discuss this year budget is lee cheuk yan chief
executive of hong kong confederation of trade unions patrick park senior tax
partner with  one-word  house and professor edward chen is
director of centre of asian studies at hong kong university
""
gentlemen welcome
""
let  ' s start with our very brief assessment from each of you about
the budget uh lee cheuk yan was it a good budget 
""
""
uh basically it  ' s very in unsatisfactory because uh the lower
and middle income group  wa  for sure will be hard hit by the budget
""
uh because the allowance had only increased by two thousand so then
more people will fall into tax net and uh more people will have to pay more
tax and at the same time  uh the increase in direct tax will affect all
the low lower income group
""
and so adding together the i think it will be a hard year for all
the working people after the budget
 
""
patrick park from a tax point of view 
 
""
from a tax  one-word  point of view  they
doubt  budget
""
uh but there are a number of interesting policy angles which i  ' m
sure we  ' ll explore later on in this programme
 
""
okay we  ' ll get to that of that edward chen 
""
""
the budget is basically very unexciting and conservative but
at the macroeconomic point of view it is perhaps appropriate  for hong
kong at this time when economic growth is likely to continue to be  slow
""
it is expansionary and yet uh we don't face a deficit
 
""
okay uhm we  ' re going trying cover a lot of these issues
""
let  ' s first  talk about the most controversial one the the
cigarette tax 
""
what  ' s its effect on economy 
 
""
well i found the interesting thing about the cigarette tax is it
it it is estimated to produce about one point nine billion of revenue after
taking into account uh consumer resistance although i  ' m not quite sure how
 how that actually work out
""
and my feeling is the this is basically a political uh angle uhm
as part of uh sir piers jacobs  '  basic selling of a general sales tax of
three percent or or vote to be low sales tax across abroad
""
because the sort of revenue yield you get from this very 
targeted attack on smokers is the source of revenue yield you would get from
a very wildly base sales tax a very small percentage
""
and i think  uh my feeling is sir piers jacobs is expecting a
loud cry uh from this narrow attack and he will say well in that case uh that
proves the the benefit of having a must more widely drawn   uh sales
tax  
""
""
 uhm  
""
i  ' m actually disappointed that he did not go for the sales tax
this year and have to leave it to his successor to deal with
""
i i i was rather hoping and as this is the last budget 
""
he would do the time honoured thing of uh taking some very
difficult decision and make it easier for hamish macleod when he does come in
as next financial secretary
""
now however uhm  uh another tax consultant  uh has made a
point that the sales tax really takes two may be even more years to prepare
""
can you tell us why this is so it
""
why cannot this be  introduce in a hurry
 
""
i think one of the main problem uh uh uh is is is is the public
acceptability now i say
""
but i changing his changing his tactic and targeting on just a
being narrow range of product
""
i think he he he will be uh in a fact promoting uh more widely
based sales tax
""
but in terms of uh uh the other reasons why takes two years uhm uh
the administration of the sales tax  uh involving a wide range of goods
""
we obviously be much more complicated and much more uhm  uh
difficult uh than the the targeting a very narrow range 
 
""
professor chen uh the financial secretary said he did  alter
 oppose the sales tax  inflationary  period
""
so why should he raise indirect tax just like like this tax on
cigarette
""
i mean isn't there contradiction here 
""
""
it is a contradiction i think i agree with uh  patrick very
much
""
it  ' s possibly a political move
""
now the public is face a choice a choice of  uh specific uhm 
 si  uh indirect tax uh pinpointing one or few commodities or a
general low rate of tax on all commodities
""
i think in the end the public may realize it  ' s more beneficial for
them in fact it  ' s less painful for them to have a low rate of overall
comprehensive sales tax
 
""
uhm lee cheuk yan do you agree with that
""
and what what do you feel the morality of the  financial
secretary targeting cigarette in terms of uh you know wanting people to quit
""
""
""
i think uh his real intention of course is not wanting people
to quit smoking
""
i think it  ' s money that he is after and i think it  ' s very
unfortunate for the low income group
""
because uh when you look at the working people their only luxury
may be smoking and to rob them of that only luxury is not really that uh
helpful
""
and also when you calculate the increase in cigarette uh sales uh
it would be about uh twenty four dollar the which is about uh if one person
take one cigarette uh one package of cigarette a day
""
then it would be about seven hundred twenty dollars and for a five
thousand uh income person it would be about fifteen percent but for fifteen
thousand income person it would be only five percent
""
  it would  would very uh uh hard hitting the 
 those  low income group  
""
""
 it so  
""
 the there are other increases   of course i mean
cigarettes is just one of them    
""
uh there  ' s increase in liquor  tax on liquor tax on travel tax
on motorist
""
professor chen will be very seriously hurt because he owes three
cars  that are are a rise of twenty percent tax on cosmetics
""
baroness dunn will be very seriously hurt
""
so you know it it is an even handed budget in that sense
""
but what worries me is his inability to deal  with hong kong  ' s
inflation rate
""
now professor chen is there something he can do should have done or
is this something which is going to be endemic to hong kong now
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well inflation of course is a very serious problem but one
must understand  is no way that the government  can resolve this
problem within a  sho  short period of time
""
uh in a short period of time the only way that the government can
do is perhaps to impose  price control something which we of course we
don't want to see
""
the long term solution of course is to increase supply
""
i think the basic problem of hong kong at this time is of very
limited resources
""
they are almost squeezing the resources at uh uhm to their limit
""
uh i think importation labour is one possibility of course i  ' m
sure  leih   this cantonese word refers to lee which is a
chinese surname  cheuk yan  you  not agree but selective you know
highly carefully uh manipulated or controlled uh  overseaed  uh
importation or or   or labour would be more 
""
""
 yes well   the the other possibility of course is
to  delink  with the us dollar which has been very weak in last few
  years 
""
""
 and   not necessarily  delinking  uh may
not uh be a solution to the inflation problem
""
if you talk about imported inflation the most important factor uh
is uh commodity prices like all prices
""
and you look at the uhm the the the inflation rate in the united
states is about five percent while we experienced about the ten percent
inflation rate
""
so if you are thinking of the link exchange rate uh importing
inflation from the world and from the united state the evidence would not
indicate this i   did 
 
""
 do   do you see any strategies of the hong kong
government in dealing with inflation
""
i mean government  ' s spending is continue to rise faster than real
economic growth and doesn't that trend   feel  inflation given the
uh  capacity  constrain  constraints such as the labour shortage in
economy 
""
""
the hands of the government uh  tie you know in in a in in
to large extent
""
uh because on the one hand if you reduce government expenditure
that might be one way to cool the economy
""
but but unfortunately we are going at a very slow rate of uh uh
growth and that would also hurt the economy
""
uh the other thing is one can of course uh look higher or 
one-word  uh uh raise the interest rate and in the same time we are
linked to the us dollar
""
i think that is one policy constraint by linking our uh dollar to
the us dollar
""
we cannot exercise interest rate policy so the hands are tied at
this moment of time
""
""
the other possibility of course is to uhm put restraint on
wages voluntary restraint perhaps
""
uhm but again that is uh easier said than done uh i think civil
servants will be the first object uh to that
""
but if you have a nine point five percent inflation over three
four years and i can't see how wages are going come down
""
""
but wages in fact are not increasing that fast especially 
 in the manufacturing sector 
""
no no in fact the real increase about two to three percent in most
of the manufactory sector is in the service sector
""
so if you impose uh wage constraint you have to be again uh
 one-word  again is extremely difficult to implement and
extremely of course difficult to be accepted
""
""
 well eight percent  
 
""
   leih   this cantonese word refers to
lee which is a chinese surname  cheuk yan  
""
""
 and and i think   uh for us is very disappointing
that uh uh the financial  secret  hint at voluntary wage restraint
asking the employer to uh restraint the wages of their employee but at the
same time don't do anything on inflation
""
and i think it  ' s very unfair to  uh pinpoint all the blame 
on wages for inflation and know i i believe that actually the
""
when we compare hong kong wages to taiwan korea and singapore hong
kong   real wage  increase is lowest
""
""
 are the  
""
but when we comparing hong kong wages to wages across the border
in the special economic zones in guangdong province if you make that
comparison wage levels here are high for the manufactory sector at least
""
""
yeah but the productivity for hong kong is also higher than
that of china
""
and i think uh when we compare we should compare the wages and
productivity together
""
and the productivity increase is far more than that of the wage
increase which is very unfair to the workers that means that workers had a
less share of the prosperity than the other uh sector of the society
""
and i think it  ' s time that we should rethink of our whole
strategy uh not to always uh try to get money out of the poor and uh not to
touch the rich
""
and  where  i  ' m very personally disappointed that  the
finance  sec   one-word  secretary do not increase
the profit tax
""
one percent of increase will already get us uh more much more
revenue and we can lower the increase of the salary tax    revenue
 
""
""
 i  ' m i  ' m sure 
 
""
 okay let  ' s come   let  ' s take a break
""
i know we are going to have more argument on this point
""
let  ' s take a break here and come back uh some further analysis
of the budget  music and a long pause 
""
welcome back we  ' re talking before the break about the profit tax
""
lee cheuk yan you  ' re unhappy there  ' s no increase
""
patrick park though i presume that you  ' re pleased there  ' s no
increase in profit   tax  
 
""
 well   i am i was slight of surprise cause i having
forecasting a half center or or or or such like uh increase in the profit tax
rate
""
uhm financial secretary has quite right in my view decided that
the emphasis should very much be on indirect tax
""
uhm his policy is to reduce or or to maintain the level of direct
tax of of  as percent of total government revenue to about sixty percent
""
uhm and i think this is important because  the future success
the continue success of of hong kong  will be to continue to attract
business in hong kong be a multinational business here and business 
one-word 
""
and i think it is on the strength of a profitable business sector
that the wages of all the people in hong kong will basically get up 
 
""
but   do you  hitting the middle is pretty hard 
 within  the tax are   high  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 well  
""
 i   do not agree on this point
""
i think the business sector has been over emphasized grossly the
importance of low tax rate
""
what do you mean by a low tax rate
""
i mean our tax rate what is low or not in in fact it depends on
the entire  uh uh tax structure
""
if you  uh take into consideration that we have very few
deductions in the effective tax rate paid by a lot of corporation couldn't be
higher than those  uh paid in the united states
""
but i think the beauty of the hong kong tax system is its
simplicity
""
you know multinational corporations like to come  because you
know it  ' s so simple you know you don't have to pay the  the tax 
lawment  you know uh you pay the government less but you pay the lawyers
more so in the end you loss
""
so i think for example increasing the standard tax by one percent
by rough calculation would come to additional revenue of two point six
billion
""
now with all the increase in indirect tax this year the additional
revenue is four million so in a sense slightly over one percent the each
point increase in indirect in indirect tax you may be able to uh compensate
you know for all the indirect tax you know   and you know 
""
""
 yeah but that  ' s   still wouldn't solve the
problem of a narrow tax base which would make us vulnerable to fluctuations
in economic activities and uh in the next few years who know i mean will the
recession coming on in the rest of the world i mean we are in a vulnerable
position
 
""
but it  ' s a question of fairness 
""
""
yeah and also i think uh the when you increase the profit tax
i don't think it  ' s emphasizes on  uh direct tax because you can reduce
the direct tax from earnings  of the working people
""
since uh actually this time the earning tax had come up to thirty
percent increase while the uh profit tax  onl  only thirteen percent
""
when you increase the profit tax then you can decrease by
increasing allowance uh tax allowance so that there would be less from
earning tax
""
so it  ' s still uh emphasize on on indirect tax it can be the same
and at the same time i i can't agree with the sales tax uh because it  ' s
still vulnerable uh uh to uh economic recession because    today
 
""
""
 less   vulnerable less   vulnerable will
yes 
""
  you you  ' re talking  about  relative  terms
 
""
  as far as  vulnerable   
""
""
 but still  
""
yeah relative may be but still when when there is there  ' s
recession people cannot buy so much and there  ' s still an reduction and sales
tax
 
""
but i think it is very important that that hong kong business
does  con  continue to fly and and i give you a practical example
""
in mid level there  ' s huge number of flat being built
""
then who are earth are going to live in all those flats who uh uh
and this is what hong kong had got to attract got to attract multinational
 who are going to
""
and this way i think the  pad  project is actually going
to be extremely good cause i think it  ' s going to be a lot of construction
company  one-word  come in to hong kong from abroad
""
and i think they are the people who are going to spend the money
in hong kong and uh  and and live in a flat give profit to the developers
who will pay tax on those profit and and generally contribute to the economic
welfare of hong kong 
 
""
okay with the economy growing around three percent over the last
three years but in government long range five year forecast the estimate is
uh five and a half percent rate of growth
""
now if a lower grade of economic growth is presumed deficit is
projected by the government or the even larger
""
so i mean is the government try to hide somewhat the uh the
fiscal picture
""
is it this because the the at once to uh you know hide the true
impact of report of airport uh  cost 
""
""
right i guess not  uh the government  ' s working on the
basis of a mid term forecast of five years
""
uh i  ' m pleased to know that uh piers jacobs is talking about
flexibility in public expenditure over five period uh of of of of of time uh
rather than you uh try to achieve a year two year balance
""
i think the world economy will recover by nineteen ninety two 
  uh i think by ninety five  
""
but but by nineteen ninety five over the period from nineteen
ninety to nineteen ninety five i don't think five point five average you know
growth uh is unrealistic
""
so uhm but surely because of the  pads  project uh the
government will have  a severe of course financial   uh difficulties
 by the middle of uh the nineties
 
""
 so you don't think it  ' s overestimated  three-words
 a half percent  
""
 uhm uhm
