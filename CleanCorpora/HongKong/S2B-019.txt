and in japan victory for the ruling party in upper house elections
good evening
thanks for joining us
british foreign secretary douglas hurd is adamant that differences
with china over hong kong ' s new airport be solved independently from other
issues
that in reference to reports that beijing is using the airport row
to block efforts to speed up the pace of democracy here
but as may wong reports hurd says political reform will be discussed
with china in the near future report by may wong with speeches by douglas
hurd 
the news conference came at the end of a busy day for the foreign
secretary
earlier hurd met omelco members and heard the views of different
political camps
he was non-committal on the issue of political reform
hurd accepted a petition from a group of husbands and children of
ii mothers before going into a meeting with omelco members this afternoon
a wide range of issues of local concern was covered from china ' s
trade status to the airport and in particular the nineteen ninety-five legco
elections but nothing new seems to have emerged
baroness dunn quoted hurd as saying the governor chris patten still
needs to have wide consultations before reporting to the british government
 
and after that is done then they will uh commence uh they will
approach the chinese authorities for uh to to seek their view 
allen lee pushed his favourite through train issue
and his answer is it is desirable
uh it is desirable to have that through train in nineteen
ninety-five past nineteen ninety-seven
yeung sum said hurd was aware many people in hong kong wanted
a faster pace of democracy but he would only rehash his pledge to take it up
with china at an appropriate time
hurd also reportedly said appointments to the district boards and
to exco are matters for the hong kong government alone
we don't get much uh so to speak uh uh con uh
confirmation you know from from him because it still depend on the talk with
the chinese government
also today the visiting foreign secretary met other community
leaders
he also visited a container terminal and a housing estate where the
politician in douglas hurd and his host governor chris patten was very much
in evidence
having been secluded from the public eye for most of sunday douglas
hurd was back in limelight today
on a visit to clague garden estates in tsuen wan along with the
governor chris patten the two men worked in the crowds as only the
consummate politicians they are could 
a brief stop at a center for the elderly made these folks ' day
earlier hurd and patten dropped in at the yuen yuen 
institute a taoist temple in tsuen wan
the first stop of the day was hong kong international terminals in
kwai chung
hurd went there without patten and was shown around by terminal
boss li ka-shing who left hurd with a platter of memories statement
by douglas hurd 
in a meeting later with the chairmen of the two municipal councils
and nineteen district boards the function and composition of district
boards the deteriorating law and order situation inflation and
sino-british hong kong relations were raised
 
mr hurd uh listened ver very carefully about what we uh
said at the meeting and he said he will relate all this information to the
government 
 
he gave us the impression that he is also very concerned and
caring about the hong kong problem speech by douglas hurd 
as douglas hurd mentioned in his news conference chinese and
british negotiators will meet again on thursday morning to try to hammer
out their differences over airport financing plans
sources say the two sides will respond to proposals put on the
table during their meeting last week
the chinese side has voiced optimism the row will be settled but
not necessarily in the upcoming discussions
the territory ' s inflation rate went back up slightly in june
this year after being on a downward trend for five consecutive months
the latest consumer price index a stood at nine point three percent
but the government says there ' s no cause for alarm
peri chow reports
the consumer price index was at a high of thirteen point nine
percent in april last year 
and only in march this year did the figure fall back to a single
digit level but the downward trend came to an end last month
compared with eight point eight percent in may the index rose by
half a percentage point to nine point three percent 
but officials noted that the index was calculated on a year on year
basis and june last year was a low base for comparison due to the
reduction in tobacco duty and the removal of the fuel surcharge from taxi
fares while june this year saw people paying more to rent a place and
buying fresh fruit
in a statement the financial secretary says the inflation rate has
been stabilizing and the territory is still on target for single-digit
inflation this year but hamish macleod agrees that inflation at the
present level is still a matter of concern
but a government economist says there ' s no cause for alarm
 
you can confirm it with an example of a car 
the speed is decelerated but because the previously the speed was
fast that ' s why the car has traveled quite a lot of distance already 
however economists in the private sector think the inflation
rate will continue to be on an upward trend
 
because of the rapidly rising wages uh property rentals and so on
our internal price structure is rising quite rapidly
and if you look ahead to the next six months or so hong kong ' s
economy should continue to show an encouraging performance
and on the basis of that i think this internally generated
inflation will remain for some time 
kwok predicts the consumer price index a will be in the range
of nine point five to ten percent in the second half of the year

electoral reform following the poor turnout in yesterday ' s nationwide
elections

polls for half the seats in the upper house of parliament

for the first time since world war two
the ruling liberal democratic party exceeded its expectations in
the elections but with one hundred seven seats it ' s still short of a
majority in the two hundred fifty-two seat chamber
the socialists were less successful than in the last polls
the buddhist-backed komeito party an l.d.p. ally made gains as did
the communists who more than doubled the number of seats they hold in the
upper house
prime minister miyazawa says parliament should look at ways to
tackle public disillusionment with the political system
yesterday only fifty percent of the people voted and he plans to
press ahead with the deployment of peace keepers in cambodia saying he hopes
they ' ll go there by the end of the year

dredging at merce bay has sparked strong protests
from both the fishing community and environmentalists
the results of the meeting of the environmental pollution advisory
committee today proved that popular pressure does work
today we we were given to understand that government would
like to one-word the mer merce bay as
a a dredging ground
and i think this should be welcomed by all the uh environmental
concerned people and uh the the uh ocean uh uh loving people
fishermen in south cheung chau however might be less happy
the new airport reclamation will increase the rates of dumping of
marine mud at the cheung chau dumping site
studies show that impact on the environment will be minimal but the
one hundred eighty fishermen in the area may not think so
i don't think it should be a say protest but at least
government should find out whe whether they are suffering from say a
a decrease in earning
and uh if so uh how to help them out for example
burrowing in castle peak another airport-related project has
also been declared environmentally friendly
