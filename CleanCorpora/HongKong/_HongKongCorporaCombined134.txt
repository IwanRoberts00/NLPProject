  good evening and welcome to newsline city university professor li shaomin was convicted of spying in china and deported but hong kong let him return to the sar was the hong kong ' s decision legally consistent with china ' s decision to expel him from the country is it now time for hong kong to elect and the subversion legislation  professor discuss this issue are senior councillor alan hoo and professor lau siu kai of the chinese university gentlemen welcome alan if i may start of you as a layer can you tell us where does the law stand uh uh li shaomin was expel from china and yet he was able to come to hong kong which is part of china how how you explain that  i think that uh you start of with the fact li shaomin met all the legal requirements for immigration entry into hong kong he has a valid passport he has a right to be uh resigning here he has a right to to work here he has not been declared one-word in terms of uh uhm a person who ' s not welcome in hong kong because of hong kong ' s own security matters so he met all the requirements that give him one-word  right of entry but the question obviously is because of his conviction and expulsion from china uh that an issue of whether he ' s affect national security arises but when such issue arises i would uh thought that the uh the procedure that would coming to play is that the central government would notify hong kong the sarg uh whether this person who has engaged activities which is incompatible with national security uh in the mainland that uh he would be classified a person who is affect the national security and with that sort of notification uh evidence should be supplied and i say that because uh if li shaomin was decline entry on the ground that he is affect national security then he has a right to challenge that decision in the court of hong kong because he ' s got one-word permission to come in  and when the matters look at by the court in hong kong then evidence have to be produced by the sarg so i think that the uh the the decision uhm is not incompatible in so far that if he is affect national security then the obligation should be on the central government to inform the hong kong government    uhm uhm   and  do you know if the central government has informed the hong kong government that he is not affected national security  i i don't know there is affect but i would assume uh that if the central government has inform the hong kong government uh then the hong kong government would not uh have a uhm its own free decision uh to ignore that that particular piece of  information     uhm   now s k the central government has not said anything in public about hong kong ' s decision to allow him back in uh do you do you think the central government is unhappy with this decision  well how can the central government say anything in public  when the whole thing is uh uh a case of hong kong serve in the interest of sino-american relationship and the when when you look at case in such a manner for example if beijing want to improve relationship with the states but releasing some people who are who are are are accuse of uh serving a spy then if these people are expel from china and they are not allow to come into hong kong beijing ' s purpose to to improve relationship with states will not be served  at the same time hong kong reputation of operating under the principle of one country two system will also be uh uh un  under suspicion so there ' s the the the whole thing is uh a can be seen more in a political manner from a political perspective and the from that perspective the faith can be easily understood    uhm uhm  so you ' re saying that it ' s not really a legal issue it ' s a political issue  well it may have some legal aspects but the to me uh uh if you take the li shaomin case will get of other cases  uh including the four coming cases uh we the whole the whole game is clear it ' s a political game   uh now alan the director of immigration says he did did not consulted the central government before allowing uh li shaomin into hong kong but he did consult the uh department of justice and  the security bureau uh do you uh do you think that at a higher level of the hong kong government they consult the central government before making this decision   uhm   uhm  i think that they must have grants uh to consult i think that if it ' s a such an open uhm acknowledge that uh li shaomin was convicted and expelled uh and if the central government chose not to inform the hong kong government that this person in their opinion poses a risk to  national security and of course when it comes to matters of defence and national security i don't think it ' s a matter within hong kong autonomy    uhm  i see uh a lot of people have cited this case as uh prove that  un the one country two system ' s concept is working  but you don't see it that way   uhm  i i do see it working but i see it working from the perspective of one country i think that matter ' s uh concerning the security of the state must be a a question which concern everybody in the country uh i think that the two systems only serve to divide the different society models uh that are in place between hong kong and the mainland   uhm uhm well uh s k i think when the hong kong government uh announced that they had allow professor li back into hong kong they said that it was an immigration issue an immigration within hong kong autonomy do you accept that argument  well basically i i i i i i accept the fact that the government position  i don't think the government expected li shaomin to come back to hong kong i mean that ' s why when li shaomin did come back the the the government was uh caught in a in a un unexpected and it takes a long time for it to come out decision decision one-word  helper consulting beijing but the uh on the on the other hand i i would say that uh uh  the the government ' s decision is based primary on national consideration that ' s why when tung chee hwa is one-word the case invention consideration national interest and hong kong interest   what lie behind it is some sort of china ' s international uh relationship so if that is the case to if if tung really want to explain it as an immigration case he should spell in more detail  what does that mean by allowing li shaomin back in hong kong but it appears to me that in the first place tung does not want  to elaborate too much on that case  secondly i don't think the government want to see this as a precedent uh which will be followed in in the future that to another question con convicted as a spy in in china will be allow automatically back in hong kong so i would say that the government ' s position is uh is pretty clear on the one hand it ' s it try to depict an image of a a case under political consideration secondly it does not want to set up precedent    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  but actually if uh this is an immigration case and uh hong kong consulted beijing uh on whether to accept somebody uh when immigration is within our autonomy isn't hong kong undermining its autonomy by consulting central government trust  it it evidence immigration pure immigration matter yes but but i think there is no dispute uh when they comes to national security it it it ' s a question which affect the whole country and i think that if the central government does not of its owner cost supply information uh to the hong kong government then on what base can hong kong government had in interest of national security  so all it can do is to look at the case in terms of his cost activities in hong kong when he allow to enter and i presume that in the four hours of questioning that he had at the chek lap kok airport that was what the immigration authority will doing try to establish whether his activities here is going to be inconsistent uh with the uh the uh the interest of of security whether both in hong kong or nationally but they certainly won't given any information from the central government uh for them to be able to take a position to say just because you expelled by china you expelled from the whole country including hong kong i i believe that it did not happen    uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  uhm uhm  i hope i want to add one point that is uh as far as i uh understand according to beijing ' s view immigration policy is not one hundred percent autonomy for hong kong for example hong kong cannot uh uh for forbid people into hong kong those are are allow by legally allow by by by by beijing to come to hong kong so in fact when we talk about a high degree of autonomy as far as immigration policy is concerned we have to be aware that there are other consideration put with the with certain extend limit that autonomy   uh s k you had said early as that this is primarily a political issue with uh some legal aspect uh now do you think the central government is happy uh uh about hong kong allowing him in uh i i see that the foreign ministry uh commissioner in hong kong has been quoted and said that hong kong made uh the right decision and and lu ping the former director of hong kong macau affairs office has also said that this is one country two system and action so is the central government quite happy with this situation do you think   uhm uhm  well i would say that central government would the see this some something which is inevitable i don't think it see it as some where happy event as far as i understand beijing really does not expect li shaomin to come back to hong kong but uh since he decides to come back beijing is also caught in dilemma but as far as i know beijing is not happy but beijing would find the situation uh to be accepted in a sense that uh it would con  it will contribute to uh hong kong ' s uh high degree of autonomy as perceived by the international community at the same time it will share china ' s purposes in in terms of its relationship with the states    uhm  uhm now alan uh aside from uh hong kong decision to let him back in uh are there any legal issues involve in the city university ' s decision to continue the employment  well i think that uh i don't know how the uh internal workings of the city university heres  but i think that once he ' s uh allowed in and uh that he can not only resign but work here uh and again i think city university has their public public status they are in no better position than the hong kong government they are not informed at all as to as to the uh the full details of the one-word activities that which reach the  one-word law in china uh so i think that to me i i to uh cannot accept that this is uh a uhm a political uh situation where it it it ' s it ' s a  matter which was political settled to the satisfaction of all parties i think it ' s clearly an issue where the central government either because of the marriage of the case in terms of uh the  capability level or perhaps it may be other considerations uh policy consideration but in many event they chose not to make this matter a matter of national security that they chose not to label uh uh mr li a person who is a continuing threat to national security because if they do then it certainly a matter within not within hong kong ' s autonomy  uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  okay thank you very much we ' ll this continue this discussion after the break don't go away we ' ll right back commercial break  welcome back we ' re talking about the return of hong kong of convicted spy professor li shaomin now s k based on uh the information that has been made public so far uh as an academic do you feel that uh professor li went beyond uh ac  academic bound in his research in china   uhm  really i don't know  because the everything is not clear to whether he has committed any serious crime uh not in china but from what uh uh uh uh we understand beijing policy throughout last several decades it seems to me that uh li shaomin was uh arrested  in a contest of uh uh uh good sino-american relationship in a contest where beijing wanted to have the olympic game and wanted to enter into the wto so it seems to me that there is no strong reason why beijing should arrest li shaomin in the first place so that leads people to suspect that there may must be something uh which has been committed by mr li which is seen to be very serious by beijing whether it constitute a spy case or not i don't think  but the it appear to me that the uh it is not necessary a  one-word case as seen by some other people but  frankly i don't know    uhm   uhm   that is  now alan the day after li shaomin return to hong kong uh ta kung pao the pro-communist paper here had an editorial saying that uh it ' s time for hong kong to enact article twenty three legislation now under the basic law hong kong is supposed enact this law against subversion succession addition and prison  do you think it is time for hong kong to enact such force   uhm   yes  i think the time is wait overdue i think that uhm from the point of view of uhm of constitutional development for hong kong i think that a point handover uh laws which are to safeguard the security and integrity and in in the situation of england you have laws that uphold the dignity of the state for example the person of the queen all these are should be in place these are these are necessary for the effective uh resumption of sovereignty uhm and i think that uh that the uh the last uh colonial regime uhm agree to that approach because uh you remember that uh governor patten uh tries to introduce uh legislation on uh subversion and succession uh in ninety six uh and that was to pave the way to have this in case so if for for for foreseen at that time was to have legislation to make it unlawful uhm for act as a that advocate the unlawful fa lun  overthrow of the government of united kingdom uh for there to be anybody who by force try to subpark  the lawful authority of united kingdom over any of each territories including uh dependent territories and what was invisited is that at the one-word  of midnight that will be adapted whereby having the terms change to central people government but that as we know was uh was not accepted by by the legislative assembly at that time   right and i i think that china also announced that it was not acceptable to the chinese government  now if if such legislation was in place one-word  on the book of hong kong will that affected uh li shaonmin ' s ability to return hong kong  yes and uh   yeah  no i think that legislation is domestic it it basically uhm the the basic law gives us the right to enact laws on our own  uh to safeguard national security interest uh uh and this was deliberately uh made that way uh it ' s not something in it in that extreme for example national laws i mean we could have been force fact by the nps by saying these are the laws which you must enact no but they but they ' ve taken the position that you can enact laws uh with our legal approach to potential approach which will be the common law approach and so article twenty three will affect the means we will enact domestic legislation that will safeguard all these matters and that will govern activities of people in hong kong so i think a important for people in hong kong to know what conduct will be uh undermining a bridge in national security i may stare in article twenty three but at at the moment it just that an empty an empty an empty uh  phrase     uhm uhm   right   uhm   uh s k do you agree uh that we should have this laws one-word july first nineteen ninety seven  well under normal circumstances i would say yes because uh hong kong is under obligation in uh basic law to give local legislation to article twenty three but we have to understand that this local this article twenty three was in certain in basic law uh in the uh at the last moment it during the drafting process to protect china ' s interest  af in the after of the june fourth event and uh the article was driven by political considerations but right now i would say that the beijing doesn't seem to have to be in the hurry to have that kind of local local legislation     right   then what about the ta kung pao editorial do you think that represent beijing ' s views   well the problem is that there even the people in the pro-china camp are quite divided on the li shaomin issue i think ta kung pao represent basically only one point of view uh i don't think it necessary represent beijing view not if you look at li shaomin case i would say that the the political need may be even less than before
