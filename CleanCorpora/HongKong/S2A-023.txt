now uh accounting education in china and accounting education
in hong kong there are differences as well as similarities 
now similarities first
we study accountancy they also study accountancy 
but within accountancy there are differences
uh i i don't want to s uh say what what our accountancy is
because you your you know very well
now accountancy in china uh when they study accountancy they really
study uh several systems
for example they study the state own uh enterprises system 
and they study the joint venture system
they also study the hundred percent hundred percent foreign
enterprises
and they also study western accounting system 
in other words they understand us because the they do uh
they do study western accounting
but in hong kong we don't understand them
we are beginning to understand them but we don't use to 
understand them because we don't study their system 
and so that this accountancy
they also study auditing but of course the the content auditing
would be different that would be uh beside their their topic today
they also study uh economics law et cetera all supporting subjects
uhm of course uh i in their uh uh uh they also have
uh have degrees in accountancy
but in a degree they don't have project
they don't study research 
they have research and project for their uh higher uh uh degree
study
they call it uh research institute
and the uh and the award will be uh master degree
so their project and research are confined to the higher degree in
the in the research institute 
and they don't prepare their student for professional examinations
of course uh in hong kong we used to uh in hong kong we used to uh
when we were s uh in the pd uh uh era we will we prepare our student
for professional examination
but now we don't
but there are still other institutes
teaching institutions preparing the students for for 
professional examinations
because in china they don't have professional examination stage one
stage two et cetera
if you want to be a cpa uh uh you you must be an accountant first
and of course er because they do not have professional
examinations uh as we have therefore they do not have professional ethics in
their curriculum 
they also uh they don't study accounting standard because they
 don they have no standards 
they have produced a draft of standards but which has not been uh
promulgated yet
so most probably next year onward they will have hopefully have the
first standard 
i have already got a draft with the stan uh the proposed
standard which is uh which uh very similar to international uh accounting
standard
in in fact in many aspect are similar to uh uh international
accounting standard 
and i think uh as far as uh university uh education is concern
 they are quite similar
they have also uh three years and they and they call it uh
professionalism courses wui gai chuen yip accounting
accounting professionalism
 wui gai chuen yip 
uh we call it professional we can call it a professional uh a
course of of professional uh uh diploma something like that 
so uh it depends the university will award a degree and the and the
colleges will award a diploma professional diploma
they call it a chuen yip mun pung in accountancy
and uhm they in uh inside their uh university or colleges they do
not have tutorials do not have seminar
they only have lectures classes 
and uh their lecturers and professors uh will lecture the students
 m uh very much the same as we do here 
so uh as far as uh accounting education is concern 
you see uh the the uh accountancy in fact in china has been
developing uh only uh in the past uh ten or uh ten years or so so there are
rapid changes in fact in the curriculum as well as in the course structures
now after after mo uh probably next year after uh china
has its own standard and also uh auditing uh guideline et cetera
at present uh china has not yet a formal any formal uh auditing
standard nor uh auditing guideline 
in fact in china accounting taxation auditing are regarded as
separate specialisms
here we combine them all
here a professional accountant must be an accountant a tax
consultant and an auditor
but in china it ' s not
so in china when you uh take on take o take on an
accountancy degree you may not study taxation
auditing they do study auditing
but as i said uh there are still not yet any auditing standard nor
uh nor uh auditing guideline so the auditing contents are very much uh at the
discretion of the university authority 
and after uh graduation they go into the accountancy uh career 
and the later on t t they uh i i in here our
graduates will try to uh complete the professional examination uh in one two
three years ' time and become a se and and and hold a professional
qualification
but in china you cannot
you have to wait a long time
you got to have many many years of experience before you can be
admitted uh to the professional body and become an professional accountant
they call it in chinese cantonese-word-for-accountant
 wui gnai si is is equivalent to our professional
examination
in fact they uh uh there are wui gnai si
go cup wui gnai si
wui gnai ngan yuen 
there ' re there ' re three grades
and a university uh uh graduate after many years of experience can
be admitted to uh professional uh accountant wui gnai si 
and then after twenty years or so he may be elected uh to be a
senior accountant go cup wui gnai si 
and i think i think uh i have i i have i have said enough about
the the differences and simi similarities between the accounting
education in china and in hong kong
but my opinion or my view is that uh when ch china is
changing
in fact china i is not many things are uncertain many
things are not steady
they are changing almost dai uh from day to day
so uh any system today may be different tomorrow in fact
it ' s not like uh hong kong we are w well established
they are not well established
they are changing
so in the future the way i see it is that uh china accounting
education will become more and more uh like western
there will still be differences but there will be more similarities
between uh china and the rest 
thank you 
i think there ' re a lot of way we can help uh our counterparts
in china
for example uh the accountancy department or city polytechnic has
recently sign up agreement with a number of universities in china uh whereby
we exchange accounting personnel
we exchange accounting uh teaching material
we cooperate in the accounting research et cetera
so each year we plan to send our staff into their universities to
give a short uh lecture as uh on a short term basis
and also they they also send their own staff to our institute uh to
do some short term teaching and research
so that is one way to start uh uh cooperating between the two
places and and and to enhance a mutual understanding between uh the two
places 
mrs chow can i ask a question
ask uh uh other speaker
i think ch china is considering uh producing its own
accounting standards
now when the standards are produced and promulgated will china uh
cancel or wash out or or annul the existing accounting regulations
in other words will their standard replace their regulations
 chairlady repeats the question and speaker a adds the following
or they or they uh would co-exist 
i i don't think there ' s any definite answer but i like to se
 the views of the other speakers
what what are their guess 
i think china would very much like to uh bring their
accounting standard in line with the international standards
and that ' s why they are very eager to join international
accountants affiliations which is the uh hong kong society is actually doing
very much to help them joining such international accounting federations
and also if you spend some time to uh read their accountancy
journal i mean the the chinese accountancy journal w there are a lot
of topics about harmonization 
however given the current situation current uh profoun 
political environment in china some of the accounting standards cannot be
modified or cannot be changed overnight
i believe if the uh open door policy continue in china and the uhm
the social systems been changed and the accounting standard or accounting
rule must follow
and also will bring them in line with international standard
would you agree uh aloysius 
if you want me to say yes i will say that
uh basically i think uh we uh we ' ve heard a lot about saying the
lack of accounting standards
i think i think the prc officials mainly the ministry of finance
is extremely aware of that
and i was uh given to understand that they have now translated all
the thirty one i i international accounting standards into chinese
for their own reference
and the the thing is if you look at the accounting law they
will say or even in in uh in the memorandum the they will always
have a section on on on on on books of accounts and accounting practices
and if you invariably you will find this phrasing uh will follow
international accounting practices and which to me means that sooner or later
they will have to address the issue on an international on international
accounting standards
and uh okay china at the moment uh there are still some problems
in in uh not not problems there are still certain restrictions whereby
certain uhm uh ssaps or i ias cannot apply
but sooner or later if they want to move out and if they want to
attract international investment they will have to comply
and one one simple e example is that uhm recently you ' ve
heard you ' ve all heard about the issue of b shares 
in the issue of a shares a shares are the shares which uh the
local prc nationals can apply
and they will always have their own accounting standards i e all
the all the records are prepared in such a way that they comply with all the
regulations and all the uh internal uh promulgations
now when they issue b shares one of the exercises uh that the
accountant international firm accountant does now these days is to translate
those into international accounting standard or or or international accepted
uh uh figures
uhm it uh my personal experience is that uh in general they do
tend to follow because basically uh at the moment when most people issue
their a shares they always have the b shares in mind
therefore they will try to adjust initially uh to comply with
international standards
uh whether or not the international standards when they are
promulgated when they are actually adopted or the accounting standards in
china when they are actually adopted will uh will uh replace the regulations
my personal view is that they may not because basically the accounting
regulations are regulating the uh not uh the accounting profession as well as
the proper books of records et cetera is quite uh similar to uh uh
miniaturized uh company law uh applicable to the individual in 
entity
uh also as charles earlier on said that every single company has
its has its own constitution i e the memorandum and articles of association
which are broadly in line with the accounting law
so therefore the i don't see uh accounting standards replacing the
regulations in the near future 
maybe i want to add something
we heard that shenzhen want to uh uh adopt the company law hong
kong company law in its special economic zone
and we also heard that they should should have been effected for
ages but it ' s still in a draft form
i haven't seen the final draft but still in a draft form
we just returned from shanghai and this time we heard another
story
shanghai has their own company law and will be the first draft
again
uh would they would there be uhm some sort of company law
applicable to the whole country
we don't know
but we guess there may be some laws applicable to a region
uh some some laws in in uh shenzhen some laws in uh shanghai
something like that
it ' s interesting 
as i said interrupted by chairlady 
as i said i haven't seen that the uh the law so i i don't know
what the differences are
but uh for example the stock exchange in in shanghai and in
shenzhen their own listing requirements are different
slightly different
although they are not uh very much but at least there are some
differences
this is quite uh annoying to the foreigners because they are very
close established very close states
how come they have different sets of listing requirement
we we can't answer that 
it maybe that they empower the uh special economic zone ' s
officials to have more free hand to run their own region
uh and therefore some of the enterprises in shenzhen they adopt
another sets of accounting systems
what they call uh accounting systems for the special economic zone
shenzhen something like that
and under which they can provide for doubtful debts
it ' s interesting
uhm whereas in shanghai it ' s still not allowed to provide for
even for a specific provision
so there are differences
