standard   yeah  uhm it ' s not very good i can say especially the economist the the lecturer is from korea   uhm uhm  and he i think that he just know some superficial knowledge about economics actually he ' s majored in statistics philosophy   right right  so but its okay for me because i i i haven't learnt economics before in secondary school so i just know what that is necessary for examinations that ' s enough    yeah  the hong kong education uh philosophy yes  uh uh when i was in university you know there were lecturers we were just we wee just warned against just told that they have the same lectures for fifty years you know and no intention of changing them were you now there were references in these lectures to uh politicians who were dead you know and other lectures were wonderful and we went to them even if we not in their in their subject so for example the the fine arts lecturers were very very good and if i could i went to their lectures but i wasn't studying the subject   yeah  yes we we can also go go to sit-in le lec  lecture room to listen to le lecturers but i have no interest in in that subjects in other subjects rather than i was like e p a majors    uhm   uhm  yeah i i think that uhm if something is difficult to understand than you should approach it historically because uh it became difficult gradually it went from simple to complex and you ' re you ' re the end of it you ' re trying to understand the complex so if you went to for example economic history lectures and you just you you then you would understand how the economy of the world developed into the the present stage and it might help you understand uhm the modern economy of the world it might not i i i have thought that to be helpful you know when there is something i don't understand try try to read the history of the subject you know  yeah that ' s good but i just don't tut uh i still can't find a subject that i ' m i ' m really interested in   uhm uhm  so i ' m i ' m just you know crossing them cross path    yes so you gets you instead of concentrating one subject you choose the subjects that help you understand the world the economic it ' s an important one you know i i think uh politicians can tell us so many lies because we don't understand economics you know and if something happens that ' s bad it is not our fault it ' s the world recession and something happen it ' s good this is all out all our all our credit we raise a few words no body knows we cant ' we can't judge these statements but i can so i think economics is an important term do you think it ' s a science field   like price  science   yes do you think it you know it gives us knowledge the way that science gives us knowledge or econo economists just guessing  yeah i think both of them are guessing   uhm  because science you know the the theories can be uhm pu  pull down by any other person any time   so all the things in the world are just guest    uhm   yeah  yes but uhm there is much more agreement among scientists than there are than there is among economists surely i mean scientists agreed that water boiled at a hundred degrees and two-words vessels at at sea level ec  economists don't even agree about about the most basic things in the subject i think   yeah  yes that ' s why i i think economics is tut is really hard to study   uhm yeah   especially i don't get have the basic knowledge in this subject anyway next year i will not study economi economics anymore   no  so i just tut i think   uhm  i just tut study it for for the examination   yes uhm what sport and facilities and  sport and facilities     uh uh   you need both   yes  yeah there are swimming pools and uh badminton courts and you ca can the volley balls and basketballs all the famous the sports at uh    uhm   so which one do you  which ones do you do none  none yeah     just sleeping yeah  you know i have lessons all the time everyday i have many lessons   yes  i can see my time table here poor me   what ' s it oh god a few words school so when when do you go to the library  library   yeah  just in sometimes i have some uh time left before two lessons but this period i i will go to the library just to study not to read the books cos   well this this isn't like my experience of university you know my experience of university was very very few lectures and seminars and and al always essays and always working in the library to work essays you know every week we had somebody had to deliver a little talk to a seminar or tutorial group and you would always prepare in one of these and you would always writing a long essay for somebody but uhm we didn't have lessons this is like school  yes it ' s like secondary schools   yeah  especially for me because uh other students in the same course but they uhm are with different lec lecturers   uhm  so they have presentations to do they have projects to do but so far i haven't got any in any of this kind of assignment i just attend the lessons and read the books and do the homeworks that ' s all    uhm uhm  well you don't know if you are making progress or not then you ' re never getting feedback you never you never presenting anything and getting a comment on   yeah  yeah it ' s quite boring   do you have director of studies  director   yeah   no     uhm now we call the ds the directors of studies the people who always encourage to uh discuss our our feelings and our our complaints if you like with with with him  no   yes we have   no a few words  i don't know who he is   oh god that is low profile   actually no one no one goes to him   no right  we just discuss with our classmates   well  but i i think next semester i will have more things to do and that ' s will be interesting cos i know that next semester we will going to have uh case studies in st statistics it ' s something like logic and you will have to discuss with a group of people to and then to tut  to do a project and use the computer to calculate the datas   that ' s what interest me    uhm   yeah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   what what  what about work experience  work experience what work    uh  no won't you trying get jobs in an office for example during the long vacation  uh   you know can't can't you try to get some kind of uhm i think you know real working experience in an office   in office     you in an office yes  what ' s an office   o double f i c e an office  office   a business a business office yeah you know it will it will probably make a lot of what the talking about a lot more you know understandable if if you if you are with people whoa re actually doing the job and saw how they did it and saw what they talked about and solve the problems where you know   yeah but we are just year one students we we don't have much chance to meet these kind of people and the won't let us to get in their office to get that working experience so so early   uhm  may be next year   may be yeah  just theory is boring isn't it you know practice can be interesting but theory   two-words yet   yeah yes so i i attend an english course lesson actually it offers you no credits you mean you know what credit means    it   uhm   no   in cu we have a we have to study for three  years before you graduate and you have to get ninety-nine credits before you graduate in these three years    uhm   yeah  ninety-ninety  ninety-nine yeah <{1 <[1 so </[1 every subject offers give you about three to four credits this term i i have i ' ll have to get twenty credits <{2 <[2 that means </[2   <[1 uh jesus </[1 </{1 <[2 i find </[2 </{2 it hard to credit that and oh well  but i think this course it ' s interesting so i i i enroll it     we well we needed nine uhm and if we did fairly well we didn't have to sit the exam  uh   yeah if if our if our credits and our if we got the very very well for our uhm tutorial papers and the essays you know you could be given a pass without sitting the exam  but i think without examination that will be a little unfair because some students will just copy from their classmates don't you think this tut something is    uhm shouldn't shouldn't really be possible there ' s a but it depends how you feel about uhm some some some subjects don't link themselves to objective assessment you know you know english most most assessment is subjective apart from paper two or something  so what do you do in this course   that ' s yes yup  in the school   in the english course  oh i see uhm tut so forth because we just meet once a week   so so far we have met for three four four times not much to do so far but i think next semester will got get more    uhm uhm  do do you read books and and does no   no  you just uhm some still teach us uhm to how to uh tut  perform in a discussion  it ' s the oral examination in a- level    uhm  uhm uhm  teach you how to uh use uhm good ideas something  especially in group discussion they have to te  teach you uhm how to introduce a friend to another friend something like that it ' s quite basic    uhm yeah  uh but i i thought you were all chinese it was chinese medium in the chinese university i thought that was the point of it  chinese medium   yeah i thought the point of the chinese university was the teaching was in chinese  yeah no not all subjects some are in english  it depends on the lecturer some are in mandarin it all depends    uhm  aw i see  uhm uhm so but i think uhm although it ' s in this course teaches us not many thing but i like it because the the teacher is very kind and there ' re only ten students in a class and we tut get very fa we make friends with each other very quickly but who ' s     so who is the teacher  he ' s a tutor from usa   uh if he ' s an american i don't know i know i know an englishman i think good and what about uhm cheung pak sha old boys name of a location pricilla union one-word  do you do you meet her   yeah   yeah an american   old boys  yeah you know pricilla live with uh in the same building with me i ' m on the fourth floor and she ' s on the sixth floor but uhm in the beginning of the that the semester that means the september this year we meet quite often  but now i haven't seen her for for a long time because we both are busy    uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  yes yes she ' s is very hard working   yeah yeah   yeah  although we live on the same floor   and anyone

side or hong kong side  it ' s new territories she ' s going to be a teacher in primary school  and she ' s now being trained in this profession something like educational school college you know     uh   i know i know the institution of education is   is moving to uh tai po they are moving f   yeah   that is that     that is institution of education well i know some of our our teachers there  teachers there   yeah i i know i know quite a few people there     wow  you know so many fr friends   no  in hong kong schools   no we we all came over together and uh they ' ve all gone all i ' m still in schools but they ' ve all gone to to other jobs and  where did where did you meet these people   usually on the plane  the plane well     yeah we we about eighty of us came to hong kong at the same time  i see   and those the plane full of us  so you came here in a group not individually    yeah  no we came we came as a group yeah this is before i came the cheung pak sha i went to valtorta in tai po   aw  valtorta   yeah uh   is that a secondary school   yes cath catholic roman catholic religious school  so why did you change it to this school   i didn't like voltorta it was uhm there was a very bad staff meeting actually uhm you know there there was a a staff meeting where the staff was all was asked to get into groups and and write down their wishes of their plans for valtorta etcetera then and then write them on blackboards and one member of my group wrote on the blackboard i would like valtorta college to be more open and the head master said nothing at that time but he photographed this he took a photograph of this blackboard and then he called another staff meeting this this first staff meeting had been conducted by our roman catholic uhm bishops sort of perhaps i don't know but anyway he called another staff meeting just for the just in the school and his and he held up the the photograph of the and said who wrote these words and no nobody said anything and then he stared going round did you write this is this your hand-writing and than uhm the person one person put up his hand and said it ' s not my hand-writing but it ' s my feeling  and uh then the staff meeting then continued in chinese that i didn't understand the rest of it i decided then that i didn't want to work in that environment but i did realize the environment was typical that i thought valtorta was unusual it ' s is the same everywhere   uhm   uh   uhm  so it ' s bad luck for you in hong kong    yes  uh uhm also it was uhm the bes beside the school was huge a huge building site and had one year of continue painting and they are going to continue for one more year and the painting i thought make teaching impossible you know because of uh many many one-word  drivers you know and not just one but many so so you'e getting one of these palms yon know every every few seconds i hate it uh it ' s impossible the school was not air-conditioned at all so you had to have the windows open and uh and sometimes you just you just wrote on the blackboard and the student copied because teach talking to them at the end of the afternoon you know you ' ll the voice was was gone from shouting so  much and the students were no longer able to concentrate   a few words   oh no  where is that school   right beside the the kcr lane so when the kcr leaves tai po and goes to tai wo there was uh there was grass on the right hand side and you can just see a high building oh i see   it ' s that school i don't know the chinese name uhm it was terrible  so the environment here is you know at least it ' s better     well until they started here the environment was a lot better yeah but uhm what what i don't like here is lunch time you know there there is no where i can go to get a uhm just a just a western snack so in in valtorta there were many places you know there is a big shopping mall and there is a pizza hut and a spaghetti house and the kentucky fried chicken  i a few words the junk food but here so i i just don't bother with lunch here i just uhm i just walked through the lunch hour and find that that means i have another hour and a half at night you know   here is one-word  so you don't have lunch   no  usually    usually no and now i find that the that that the the lunch time is useful walking time because the staff room is quiet and i can get a lot done you know so it ' s good   you  yes   it uh i think i think this will be my last year  i want to ask a question   yeah  uhm in staff meeting in this school do they in en english or ch cantonese    yeah  cantonese  cantonese   yeah  so do you at attend that meeting   yes i i do attend yeah  you have to   i have to attend but sounds ridiculous it it ' s not it ' s not so ridiculous you know  ac  actually there is a student a a teacher rather who is supposed to be my interpreter but uh well you know he ' s he ' s van van dickson   uhm  oh i see he ' s a   and so my previous interpreter was john law the physics teacher  who went to canada   uhm  oh i see   and he was he was very conscientious he he he perform his duty very well he wrote everything he just it was like dictation he   you know he ' s always telling us that he ' s is proud of his english standard and he said that many  en uhm foreign friends say that he speak good english    uh   yeah  yeah he ' s very proud of that   so he he covered up these sheets with english and passed them to me to read  uh huh   and it was   very helpful   it was no it was rubbish well his english was good but i i get would the sheet so uhm uh toilet paper consumption has increased by twenty-five percent on the course of this uh one-word the the school officers reluctantly actually to ration the the toilet paper but uh if if teachers are not more economical uhm they they will to be rationed you know one roll each per term i said john it ' s all right i don't want to leave and then uhm one one one was one was terrible once was uh the principal had been walking the school and he was shocked by some of the behaviour that he was seeing as he looked through the the door and   yeah i know that    and one one uh example that shocked him greatly was that in uh john law ' s physics lesson you know a form seven student had   my class   no previous form   form seven    previous form seven class   oh    uh michael chang margaret uhm lun man yee joyce was  one-word that that that class uhm was drinking had his drinking water out of   water    yes and the the teacher should know that that eating and drinking in classroom was strongly forbidden so he had to write this uhm denunciation himself you know and pass it to him so then i then john law was was went to canada and i said that i asked if i could have dickson as my my uhm translator so that now the staff meetings are more better i have a little bit of chest problems and i studied my chest problems and at the end i said what was discussed and he said bull shit and that ' s the extent of my uhm  perhaps cannot speak in in that meeting it ' s better for you   uh yes i think   as you don't have to listen the rubbish    yeah  i ' m glad i ' m glad and then may be six months later the the minutes are distributed in english and that i see that dickson was right and i must one-word there ' s nothing uhm but what i i don't mind the main staff meetings because these are for everybody and i don't mind the the assembly because we are there to make a kind of ceremony for the students but it ' s the occasional staff meetings they are often for one one p m in the geography room and there ' s may be once every two weeks and mr liu and mr kwong will rattle at the students and the teachers i think i shouldn't have to go to these you know a teacher had been just come out of these and tell me what what was said and i often have to cancel my own class because of them and i think it ' s a complete waste of the school uh   uhm uhm  how often do they meet   about once every two weeks usually once a fortnight  once a week   no they usually on average every two weeks there will be a { >  you just impromptu one announced that morning so i came in the morning and i see that it written up on the notice board that staff meeting geography room ten past one and i i usually think that this could just be a  one-word you know the whole thing the staff never never see anything the staff are all may be audience   uhm  so who speaks   the the principal mr ho mr yue and then other teachers give reports uh prefect studies discipline and so on but the whole thing could be written down and photocopied and send to us we just need the minutes do you do you have a students union  yes   are you an active member  no but lau chi lei ' s sister is in cu and she is a member in the student union   uhm  although i think she is not active   no  although she is a member because many activities you know the student union has organized many activities and i don't see any anyone with her name in the activity    pet petal i mean petal  pat   her english name is petal  petal   yeah as a flower   how to    uh p e t a l   pet  you still remember her name   yes yes uh yes i remember that class lai ho yun jessie  i forgot her name    ken kenneth wong was in that class but he repeated   form three and the paul and the kitty   yeah yeah  uh do you remember uhm tut i don't

or in the orientation camp camp you know be before the semester begins we have a orientation camp for all the freshmens and he was my leader in my in that group i was in the same group with him and now we just meet occasionally and we have dinner and lunch together sometimes   good was he embarrassed   no he is active    no  good so do you you have a canteen in the   yeah canteen near the hostel    yeah  is it good  oh   no   tut no not much to eat cos uh at the beginning i mean in this i mean in this september it just feel that wow great uhm the food are new to us  now we just there ' re uhm fewer and fewer choices offered to us so we rather to cook our food own food in hostel and you see my roommate i brought bring my photograph with me two words this one    uhm uhm   uhm uhm  what is her name alice alice   and uh  but i don't call her alice i call her feih liu that means fat man   oh like f fat a few words     she ' s a little bit too fat    uh not by western standards so you must be close friend because you ' re buying matching matching t-shirts  that that ' s a present which to her from me   uh  i buy two dresses and i give one to her   i suppose you don't have many posters on your wall yet  yes because that ' s it this was taken in uh october   uhm  and now we ' ve got a posters and uh some other decorations at the wall   good good but the looks are very uncomfortable frankly  uncomfortable uhm uhm you mean the     yeah   very thin mattress  aw i see    do you have air-conditioner   and  no   oh  only in ut ust there are some rooms with air- conditioners but you have to pay for it    uhm  right  you have a card they give every student a card actually you have to buy the card   uhm  and then whenever you want the air-conditioner to open to operate and you s insert that card into it into it   metre yeah but you know we are going to be fully air-conditioned soon  in the every cla classroom   yeah  oh   is this is how the government spending its bonus air-conditioning the schools  so but do they collect money form the students    and then they  yes there is a monthly charge for the electricity and the    how much  yes i ' ve just seen piano and schindler ' s list   yeah i saw piano too but i haven't seen schindler ' s list yet was it good  yes is very good and very moving uh uh most of the people  in inside the cinema i i think come out with tears in their eyes   yeah it ' s true i think it was a very touching movie have you seen schindler ' s list  no not yet but i will uh s watch it uh on the  holiday  uhm   how many awards did it get  about it it ' s nominated for ten awards but it get only seven   do you remember which ones  uhm the best picture the best director uhm tut the best original score and i cannot remember all all the all the all those but uhm because because it is very hot this year for schindler ' s list to get all all the all all the other all the awards and i remember and the best picture uh only schindler ' s list are are hot others like the fugitive uhm tut the piano the in the name of the father are tut just uhm showing no one will vote an  any es especially for the fugitive have you seen fugitive  the fugitive     yeah i see i saw the fugitive i actually i like it did you like it did you see it  no   did you see it  no   it was pretty good uhm but i was it was more predictable   and it ' s not as deep i think the storyline is more superficial   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   oh was was the schindler ' s list was a very long movie wasn't it yes more than three hours uh huh i know that this is this is mo this movie is about the nazi nazi camp  is it frightening but  camp  uh yes because i have studied history in my  secondary so i ' ve known some background about it uhm but uh it ' s not so violent because you you just see some the jewish people are shot tut the gem gem german there ' s not  s uh many bloody scenes but the feeling you can get is uhm tut it ' s very sad because you you you see the little children they uh hide themselves under the bed and in tut in the uh sewage and husbands and wives are are separated  uhm and it is because because they are very young and they are just like ordinary people like mot of us   and it is i i think it ' s strange to see have experienced those kind of things they are uhm tut children uh teenagers and ordinary people and and i can remember the one uhm that one one speech spoken by one of the uhm german killers and and a girl witness that he killed a peo  a pedestrian just passed by and she said that woman was not uhm fatter was not taller was not shorter or any kind just just an ordinary woman passing by and i don't know why that german people shot shot her so and that girl the nazi people was the servant in i that german troop killer and she was very afraid that one day she will become one of the  victims   and and i i cannot imagine that when i was one of those people i ' ve been live in uh fear everyday  uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm uhm actually i have been to poland last summer i have visit uhm one nazi camp  uhm  uhm and i ' m really frightened by the atmosphere there  uhm    it ' s it ' s black and white isn't it for most of the film   yes  uhm   did you find that wa was hard to follow because it is black and white or was the effects better  no because it ' s more like the the real the real situation because you see some is it doc call documentary or   documentary films always always in black and white and i think it is a very a very thoughtful way of expressing uh the uh director ' s uh expression is that uhm the camera is always uh in in some situation they shake just like uhm tut the reporter running around to to catch the scene and it makes uh the movie become more real   uhm  and i i saw in the name of the father too and i find it very moving    uhm   uhm   uhm  uh have you see it     i i have seen it too   uhm how do you find it  uhm  i i just like it uhm   what is it about i haven't i haven't seen it  and it ' s about uh i think it ' s uh mainly about the scandal of the british government or british the po uh the police and because uh tut there ' s   and i think it reveals the corrupted side   ille of legal system     yes  yes not just the british one and uhm the main character was the was the irish people  and they are uh tut very ordinary or discriminated because they do not have proper jobs and just playing around and uhm some of them are thief and they take drugs and they want to escape from the terrible situation in in ireland and they went to britain i i think the movie is i i think the because it is a true story and it was happened a about do you remember the the time it happen   uhm   no   about twenty years ago i think uhm tut the main character uh is the name jerry and he he met some people in in britain and suddenly there was a bomb uhm tut in one of the bar i  think it ' s a bar and jerry and and his friends was accused that they have uhm they are the terrorists and so they were uhm taken to the court and threatened by the policemen by using some violent means and and police threatened to harm his father  and so he signed the agreement i think uh not agreement the confession that uh he has done done done that thing and the four people has uh went to prison for twelve years was he was sentenced to fifteen years but after twelve years uhm they were the it was cancelled    yes   yes   uhm     release  yes dis dismissed and the main theme of the movie was about uhm the jerry ' s father and he went to prison voluntary to uhm tut accompany his son and this i i saw just critic about this uh movie because in the name of the father has i think is two meaning the first meaning is uhm it ' s like uhm tut some religion uh in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit and just like some uhm uh hope that will be a justice but actually there ' s not in not just in the movie so it ' s quite ironic to use this name and the other name is to uhm illustrate the uh relation between the father and the son the love between them    the   uhm
