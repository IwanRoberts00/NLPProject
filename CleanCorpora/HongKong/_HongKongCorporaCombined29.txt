like that  uh huh so uh what else do you write in do you write for asm   oh no for asm i have to write asm i have to do copy writing  copy writing so that ' s is uh for adver advertising   yeah basically the one-word executives go out and they got all the ads  uh huh   uhm and then they come back with to me and they give me like the company ' s history or what their products are one-word  the products what the people want to say and i sit and just write a little advertisement for them   uhm aw   uh huh  the the slogan or the the caption     yah  yeah the caption   or or you    and and the co and the two-words   which is only it ' s not very long really  it ' s about it ' s only about a hundred two hundred words i ' ll do that it ' s it ' s quite boring cos it ' s uhm cos asm is like a trade  uh huh   uh huh  trade magazine     yah so it ' s i ' ll do for the consumer products  uhm uhm   but uh it ' s really boring so i have to write thing you know about the bloody one-word  and then the next thing it ' s about the garden tool and the next thing is about it ' s sort of cookery and i think it ' s just like  so it ' s not exactly exciting but it ' s quite good cos it pays you know it means you are going to be able to pay rent sort like that   uh huh  uh huh    that is   is this the summer job or summer job part-time job    well   sum summer job    no it ' s part-time  part-time job     but it ' s it ' s what is what is i mean as far as i am concerned i ' m doing this and i don't know if i will remain  freelance two-words  i think i want to get up uh something a bit more full-time so while i ' m looking i ' ll do this as it keeps the money coming in but i ' m i ' m still going to do something else i think i ' m not i ' m really sure cos i ' m quite i mean i ' m quite happy happy because my i ' m boss you know i can do what want i can get up when i want i can go where i want as long as i put in my twenty four hours in asm as long as i you know so it ' s up to me what i do  do you know what i mean so i quite like it  the same time i ' m i lack motivation   uh huh   yah sure sure   sure  uhm uhm   and so and so  so you need to have jobs to keep keep up your motivation     yeah   do you do you know what i mean and i  get the laziness so i ' m just thinking i so one-word  that a few words today  yeah just like i might i think i ' d rather and you ' re always when you are freelance you just constantly worrying about money the whole time   yeah   yeah  uhm uhm   uhm so i think i ' d rather get a job that was uh you know  full- time   that can keep you working all the time   well one you a few words not but i ' d rather do those that i can go to work at nine leave at five and then  leave at five and then i have to think about it whereas for freelance i always thinking about work because because it ' s all that a few words hours and you don't what you are doing and you know one minute it ' s left isn't it so you always thinking about where where you go to work if you got another another job you can leave at five and then you forget it until the next day   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   uhm   do do you think you will change uh your style of life you you will continue on and on like this    so   working  yeah i think it ' s tut it ' s a very busy life   yeah i like it like that   when when do you get it some time to a take a break uh huh tut     uhm   you know go to travel and take  some rest    yeah i should actually don't do anything on sunday i maintain that because uhm in the evening i think the evening are not too bad i try to get everything i try to fit everyone about in so i can get it all done in a day  uhm uhm  uhm   but uhm yeah i do but i don't i think i ' m going to spend more  two-words in another year may be what i mean i wouldn't be doing i quite fancy i want i want to go to japan   japan   japan    yeah  then you have to learn japanese so     yeah that ' s true but also i want to go there because i i like i ' m really like it it really fascinates me the culture and the people   everything i really really i want to go there before hong kong but i don't have enough money cos you know in japan you ' ve to   uh huh   japan is much more expensive     yeah you know   lifestyle    yeah when when you get a flat you have to like put down like a whole year ' s money and you don't get it back it ' s like   yes   yeah yeah    what you know is really expensive so   uhm  and many many youngsters in jap in japan they they give up they give the idea of having a flat in their life    really   yes yes that ' s true   so where do they live with their parents  either with the parents or they rent a flat rent they rent a flat instead of buying it   no but even if you rent a flat you ' ve got to give a whole year ' s rent money  yes but it ' s quite impossible to buy a flat cos it ' s too  expensive   too expensive  espec especially in uh tut city just like uhm tokyo    really   those  yah sure   so aren't they   and they got and they got uh some kind of uh beds it ' s uh just just a bed for rent and you just sleep in there like uh   oh you got a bank  like a coffin is it   coupon   co no dead people sleep where is that what was that  coffin     coffin   coffin   yes like a coffin yeah you     some people sleep in a room of a size of a coffin yes   is that what you are saying  yeah they are especially designed uhm got     oh i know on the platforms of the train stations they have them don't they  yeah   uh do you know that in the train station they are right there i was yeah yeah yeah i remember somebody telling me and you just put you put you just put some money in and you and   yah it ' s locker a locker    it ' s just like a locker and you just go in there and sleep and you got yeah yeah   and you lock yourself   yeah    apparently they are really really fun i mean i would not like sleeping in one for a time apparently they are really really good   yes in fact in hong kong it is expensive to buy a flat in hong kong     yeah  it ' s hard to  yeah     hong kong apparently someone told me that hong kong is is just as expensive as japan if not more so i mean to go out and sort of go out for dinner and and drinks and coffee or tea and stuff like that i mean i don't know about the actual fare rent so i don't know about rent and bills and that sort of thing but apparently the daily day run-of-the-mill hong kong is just expensive   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm uhm   yeah provided that they win the mark six mark six  yeah     yeah   do you want to win the mark six    and i want to  i want to win mark six  i want to win too you too we need to buy the mark six this coming christmas the price is very high   very big is it   like about  yeah yes the amount uh i think it is uh a million thousand  how many     oh   it ' s it ' s very very big  three thousand   when when when in uh big festival like christmas new year the one word price yeah yeah    a thousand million you mean   and the mid-autumn festival    oh wow   you should buy it   when was is it done on tuesday  tuesday and thursday   yeah well perhaps we can we have to go to the hong kong jockey club to issue an tickets  yeah   i don't know where to go  once we get the first price then you don't have to work for the rest of your life  it does     yeah but then you ' ll be bored wouldn't you  no i have other things to do i ' ll travel     what would you do  travel   you travel  travel and then uhm tut to to do things i want to do like painting painting will be   yeah  yes one-word     uh you have lots of hobbies  yeah   you have to have like cos you what yeah you don't have to do things like eat and pay and said that you got a purpose a few words  that ' s what that ' s what the reason why you get up every morning is because you want to finish your picture  and you have to try and serve but it wouldn't matter if you didn't cos you have this money in the bank  you could actually physically do not very much everyday i don't even think you can travel or all much because days have become   uh huh   yeah   yes    yeah they might not be so i i don't know but uh uh they lose if you i mean it ' s all very well travelling for about like a year or so you couldn't do it forever you have to get back to something   but uhm yes   yeah but uh     are you girls just gradated  yes graduated   did you have to wear do you wear something like in your graduation   yes   yeah yes is the same kind   we didn't wear we didn't wear hat wait may be yes we did yes we did yes we did   you did yeah  yeah   yes we did   uh huh  we ' ll have our graduation on january   on january   ours is in february yeah   yours is in january  yeah february     are your what your this year  yeah uh in   yes    and haven't had yours yet  no haven't haven't  no  we haven't   is it about a year after you leave and you have it   yeah yeah yeah   yes   yes    yeah same as with in england is stupid isn't it  stupid   how long you should or it shouldn't two-words  they go because   oh  and the process is very very funny  because  i think they a they afraid they afraid that uhm not all the students can graduate is it or two-words      i think it ' s the system   uh well also is quite nice that cos you haven't been in college for years and go back and you find out what everyone has been  doing and catch up with people that you haven't seen that ' s be quite nice that side of it you know there was those cos you somebody like you know s some of the people in university you just you can never keep up with everybody   uh huh  uhm uhm   so yeah it ' s was quite nice as it   is an occasion that you can meet everybody   yeah yeah you just meet up old friends and  so what kind of subject you study in university   university    uhm design of history   design of history   yeah  design of history   well history of design  history of design   yah  uh what what kind of design fashion design or  interior design    uh  yeah everything  everything   yeah  so it touches on the     well i did my thesis on uhm what i did on the use of sexual imagery in design of perfume advertisements between nineteen eighty and nineteen ninety two  difficult topic   that was the subject   right  yes   and that ' s that was mine  and then i did mine i did my special on subject on shit what was that one fashion women ' s and the garment in the eighteen century yes i think  it means nothing a few words   like the   like the   wow  on sexual imagery   no two-words it wasn't in the garment uhm i think i did i ' m ready to wear plain thing actually in the in nine nineteen fifties and sixties   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   so a few words are completely different aren't they  is that uh is that dissertation topic   no that my dissertation was was the section  one- word the design of perfume the first one   one-word  uhm uhm     and the  the perfumes uhm uhm     yeah  and then that one was that one was another it ' s not quite a dissertation  it ' s not as long i think it ' s only about   uhm uhm  but uh   five thousand or six thousand words whereas  dissertation is like ten or twelve i think   uh  uhm uhm but is it is it hard to link to think of an to an an an idea to  uhm tut on perfumes and the sexual imagery    yeah very   oh no no no not at all i mean that once you start  once once once you decided what you are going to do i mean basically what happen to me was i ' m i ' m obsessed with magazine i just think and the the most fantastic form of medium and communication and that just i just love them because they are so uhm accessible and and they are a bit not the daily newspaper which get thrown away people keep magazines and yet they still got the same quality you can just take up them to read and then put down and then a week later with a different feature and i just think they are wonderful anyway so i want i knew i knew i had to do something with magazines so i was looking through then i ' m sort of looking through the adverts and notes changes in the adverts and then as as the time went on and i have things changed and have fashion about blah blah blah blah so i just went write on to that and adventure i just sort of  one-word i know of the of stick perfume   because it a luxury good luxury item so it ' s quite to write about things like that it ' s quite easy you know it ' s just basic wear of men   is it difficult   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh huh   uhm uhm  yeah my interest in perfume is the the bottle   yeah  the bottle of the perfumes i think they are fascinating   cos     they are quite decorative aren't they  most of them yeah  but i i didn't really look in to that very much i mean i did obviously i mentioned it but i didn't sort of like dwelled on it this is really funny like basically in like the eighties when you know the early eighties when aids really sort hit like new york and london and when everyone was like uh more i mean it was a few words  write longer than that but but when you know hit mainstream what mainstream the world knew about it uh you know the influence it had on the on the advertisement the time it was incredible you know everyone would be so overtly sex use so much sexuality because  because they didn't want to promote this of aids and everyone you   know i think it ' s like that you know you you sort of look at it from like a social point of view you think what was happening at the time what was going on and that ' s the fact yeah i did notice the way influence each other and has some   really interactive and that ' s is basically that just an example that ' s basically you know how it how where   yes   yeah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   yes they   uhm uhm   uhm uhm yeah   oh yeah   whereas those ads use the sexual imageries for all kinds of products   yeah sex sell that ' s why   yeah all the things are are related to sex yeah   or exactly one-word is the advertisement too they want to sh they want to shop people uhm  sex sell so they use it  it ' s the oldest one in the  three-words, etc isn't it but it works it really does work i mean look at calvin klein for god ' s sake i mean you know yeah   yeah   they use it al   yes then you have a k uh perfume a new brand of perfume uhm there is for for both sexes     yes   i ' ve seen that   for both man and women    it ' s bottle it ' s bottle is beautiful i love it   it ' s really stunning it looks like a it just look it ' s so simple and really plain isn't it   you   yeah  yeah   it looks like something you know you have on the kitchen on your kitchen shelf it ' s just sort of like really sort of like  uhm   it ' s really nice what ' s called though i can't remember  i think it ' s just called ck isn't it   i ' m not  i think i think so i don't know i haven't seen the bottle   no  but i know that they they have a this new product i think it ' s a very good idea    yah  yeah i do as well  good promoting ideas     i ' m going to get it when it come s to hong kong i ' m going to buy some  uhm yes    a few words  as a present   yah i can buy it for one-word i can wear it as well it ' s a good idea is it white musk then  it was uh so uh you have tried so many jobs so what kind of job you really looking for   i don't know really that ' s the problem with me i don't know i can't make up my mind i ' m so indecisive  but you are interested in journalism you are interested writing writing essays   and and design     uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm i don't know yah i think i ' m slightly a bit more i i want i don't know i don't know really it ' s it ' s i never want to be a journalist really i  one-word wanted to do  i just sort of fell into it  and uhm and also it ' s the only sort of viable thing you can do in hong kong freelance-wise i mean or temp temporality i mean for example if i was in london you know i could i could be a secretary if i had no you know what i ' m saying if you only got like six weeks to make some money and whatever just get a part-time temporary job and other type whereas in hong kong i couldn't do that because the only the only there ' s not not so many sort of  one-word sort of things that i can do apart from write uhm style you know it has to be sort of media-related really   you know that ' s not you can't really get temporary jobs there because of the language barrier two-words  you know that ' s what i couldn't do that stuff  uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh yeah   uhm  but you can type you you need to buy a typist    yeah   yeah yeah is your job uh similar to gary gary   no no no uh he was   uh he ' s yeah   he was uhm he ' s a cameraman  camera   yah uhm i met him uhm   he ' s not a jour he seem to be a journalist   a journalist   journalist yah   he was a journalist well he sort of like he ' s a journalistic sort of one-word the problem is with him i don't know about nbc but i know that uh reuters television basically in uhm you kind of do everything you know you sort of like yeah you you do the filming and then you do do the sort of like editing and you do the writing and you do everything that ' s probably that ' s gary does as well  yeah i think yeah gary was a journalist for   two-words but uhm i don't know if he is uh some of the show   uh huh   few month  so you haven't thought of being a reporter   no  reporter no   i think i quite like the to do pr  public relations   yeah in profession house   uh  uhm uhm   that ' s what i want to do  but your character is very sociable   yes  he is very sociable   if    yes but public relation is sociable isn't it   yes   yeah   yeah so     and i ' d like to do for fashion because i love fashion i love art  yes i think you are suitable for this kind of job yeah you you ' ve got the skills experience things   but i haven't got i haven't got really any direct experience with public relations  i haven't   yes but uhm that i think you get the qualities of being a pr   yeah  because they need to uhm tut uh to know something about publish and uhm yes and that a sociable character     right yeah   exactly you know how to you know you know you need how to you know how to handle the press and stuff like that   and you need be able to write press releases you need be able to uhm be quite confident quite communicative uhm yeah the basic the problem would be with with being in hong kong at would be the language problem uh wouldn't it that would be would be the problem   yes   uh huh   uh  uhm uhm have you tried to think to be a property negotiator property    uhm   because property negotiator also need to be aggressive and sociable and two-words     why have they to be social  yeah because you need to communicate very   uh     why   very well with the with the buyer   well with the client yeah yah clients yah   yeah yeah yeah it ' s boring it ' s easy  yeah sometimes it ' s a bit boring but when you   no but it ' s very easy do you know what i mean it wouldn't it wouldn't challenge me mentally i could sit there  all you have all i have to do is get one client find out the house that i need i can sit there and you know going through the computer and work out what i ' m doing and uhm that you know i mean it just would be to be so easy  i can just do it like that you know so   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm   you mean it ' s not challenging   yeah  but provided that the kind is not uh uh may be you you meet some tough client  yeah  yeah yeah tough clients so uhm then you     yeah but they like the house they don't buy the house that ' s the isn't it it doesn't it doesn't matter if no i can't i can't is isn't challenging i mean it ' s not a difficult job you might you might even work you i ' m saying you don't have to work on it cos you certainly do that you that you do have to work on but everyday is the same thing you just take people to the houses you look at the price range and say how much they want to say fifty five thousand per house what area fifty five thousand per area blah blah blah bring up all the bring up the manual arrange the appointments tell the clients di di da di di da and that ' s is and then do the paperwork and that is and this the same every you know the same you meet client   everyday  there is nothing new there ' s nothing can go wrong the only thing that will be goes wrong is you lose the house the house go before it ' s you know you think it ' s buy worthy but it ' s not   yeah   yeah   uh huh   yeah  uh huh   the client find so much one-word it ' s own you a few words money no no it ' s not challenging enough and if you like it but it ' s just a bit boring  i ' m really glad that i did it cos i gained the experience to   uhm  to negotiate yeah   well and and just to experience the property market you know  uhm uhm and yeah   and it always something that i can call back on which is really good   no i can't    i have to ring tania is she ' s in town and to see a

don't   what did you do in university  uhm comparative literature   comparative literature is that what lily did  yes same the same student we are uh   you went to same school together  the same secondary school and then the same university     and the same university  the same year and everything  yes   is she your best friend  what do you mean by best friends   well if you to spend a lot of time with her and  speak to her a lot of time during everyday   yeah  yeah a few words best friends   oh one of your best friends   one of my best    uh  yeah uh but after uhm tut entering university i also make many many other new friends   right  except except the same group because uh we the whole campus uh from uh from my secondary all went come to to the same university    right  oh my god it never happens in england ever ever  does doesn't     no  you well you never go to university i mean you never go to university in the area that you live or you went to schooling hardly anyway  i don't

increasing   right  yeah so it ' s not difficult and i don't think that it is very bright to for for one to get in university in one-word  years     really uhm  but some people they still have this kind of thinking about that where in hong kong if you can get into the university and you must be very bright bright huh that should be     it ' s not it doesn't work that really  doesn't work yeah
