do you find do you find uhm keeping a dog   or a a pet is uhm is not an easy thing to do i mean it ' s fairly time consuming and i mean pets have their own feelings they need they need their uhm masters yeah to to spend time with them    uhm uhm   uhm   uh uh yeah   uhm uhm  uhm yeah  yeah i mean some dogs uhm uhm when i i remember when i  uhm visited a friend of mine yeah uhm she has a dog  her dog is also a boxer    uhm uhm   ah   uhm uhm  ah really   yeah yeah   what colour  a dark brown one a dark brown   one     dark brown yeah yeah   uhm uhm  the typical the typical yeah   typical  yeah uhm and at first i was a little bit afraid of it  yeah because he i i mean he was very friendly he licks me all around  he licks my legs he licked my face my face and my arms yeah a laughs  he was very friendly but i wasn't very use to it    but gradually i tut i mean uhm i play with t i play with it and uh  it ' s a it ' s a it ' s it was a very interesting experience  i think being with a pet yeah  what what do you mean uh     ah   ah   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm  sorry  what is your opinion about keeping pets   ah yeah the pets uhm makes me relaxed    yeah i love dog yeah uh my house in japan there are five dogs  now my parents also likes dog  yeah so when i was child my parents got uh two dogs  so uhm yeah  mayb i think uhm my whole life is with dog    so yeah  $a and $z laugh so uh when i come to hong kong uh last year  at that time i feel uhm very lonely because i  didn't have any friends in hong kong  so i eager to get dog but uhm i have no chance because  i uhm the flat i used to live was very small but after moving new flat i got new a big flat so yeah i decided to walk by yeah  $a-laughs your dog   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm uhm   ah   ah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  so i i i have a question do do many japanese keep pets because uhm i have a a japanese uhm girl friend yeah who    uhm uhm  japanese girl friend  yeah japanese girl friend  s uhm she is living in tokyo and she  is living she says uhm she tut  her flat is not uhm very lar very large but  it ' s not very large but she keeps a pet a dog a small dog  and she said to me that uhm many japanese uh like to keep pets  uhm do you think so    uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   large   uhm uhm   oh   uhm uhm   yeah  uhm yeah i think yeah japanese likes yeah keeping pets  because uhm but uhm uh 1-word  yeah but in tokyo in case of tokyo uhm  uhm a a lot of people has to stay uhm in very small flat so they  they cannot keep and their landlord landlord don't let uhm them to keep dogs because the pet  uhm makes room dirty sometimes  uhm uhm  uhm uhm   uhm uhm   yeah i see    yeah uhm uhm but i was very surprised uhm yeah in hong kong uhm people living in flat not house   yeah flat but there is lot of people got pet yeah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  i think uhm it is not i think it is a good thing to keep a pet yeah to have company in case  you you don't have friends around or i mean s dogs are  tut very interesting animals yeah they can  feel what what you feel yeah  tut  it is very interesting    uhm uhm   uhm yeah   uhm yeah   uhm uhm   yeah yeah  yeah and uh i like dogs

you   so if i remember correctly uhm you ' ve been to german last year no   uhm uhm  yeah yeah   yeah  so how was your trip   yeah  wow  $a-laughs it it ' s a long story i think     long story  yeah but if you uhm tut  let ' s let ' s just talk about uhm the my german course uhm the german my sum german summer course  in germany  ah yeah i yeah i took a uhm a one month course in a in  a city called stuttgart have you ever heard of it    uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm yeah i know yeah  uh i never  is that big city or   yeah   yeah it ' s a big city  yeah it ' s 1-word no no   no  uhm it ' s uhm at the south of germany i i mean at the  tut how do you say anyway uh southwest of germany   and is famous for wine    it ' s not country side   no   uh uh  oh wine german wine yeah  yeah yeah uhm cars   cars uhm especially mercedes benz    cheese   cars  uhm  yeah porsche yeah  uhm  and other large industries yeah  especially the m the car industry i think    uhm   yeah  car industry uhm   yeah  uhm i found the course there uhm very fascinating    fascinating   yeah and very challenging  because i ' ve got uhm friends i mean classmates   uhm from other european countries such as  sweden czechoslo slovakia   and italy    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  italy yeah   yeah i mean especially     it ' s very international  yeah it ' s a it ' s a   you got  you know actually the name of the course is  international summer course yeah uhm the north european yeah    uhm uhm  north oh   your north of your north of european su  especially the s the swedens are very good at german  yeah  yeah they some of them have only learnt the language for two years and they could speak it fluent fluently    uhm uhm   yeah  ah  yeah and i ' ve known uhm a classmate call  uhm came from czechoslovakia  yeah the country that just next to  germany  and she told me that she had learnt german for only a year  but i just couldn't believe it because  also she can express herself fluently in german yeah  i mean tut gen tut uhm i mean you can say that generally uhm asian students are a little bit uhm behind the class  $a-laughs 1-word  sometimes i can't catch up uhm what my classmates and  the teacher ' s discussion yeah it ' s uh rather difficult for me    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   ah   wah uhm   uhm uhm   ah   uh uh  i think asian people sometimes are very quite   and uh uhm 1-word shy sometimes is shy uh so when i was in london yeah i ' ve been going uh i i went to english conversation school for one month  tha at that time yeah the spanish or italian they were very active   uhm   uhm uhm  uhm yeah i believe so     yeah  yeah yeah we japanese were very shy both-laugh yeah calm  uhm uhm yeah uh i i think uhm my language yeah my german improves much yeah after i took that course  uhm the main thing is that i my confidence uhm has been boost up yeah in speaking the language yeah before i tut i think uhm i was also a bit shy   in speaking the language yeah like i did uhm in primary school when i spoke english   yeah i uhm tut i was very reluctant to say or to to uhm talk in english yeah bef uhm before the class yeah how about you    uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  yeah me me either yeah both-laugh  i uh i get nervous like this both-laugh  yeah uhm yeah so where are they just stay in german it ' s a

no   no  no  $a-laughs    uh  i ' m i ' m i ' m not very active in in seeking a job  yeah i mean tut i yeah love a job  uhm that in which i can speak languages yeah such as uhm english or putonghua    ah   uh uh   uhm uhm  putonghua  yeah so probably i ' ll go to the teaching ' s sphere yeah to be a teaching teacher   teaching what  te   english perhaps     oh  at the high school or no secondary school   uhm uhm i mean it doesn't matter to me or in a  secondary or primary school   but i think it ' s very hard to get the job of teacher  because now uhm the economic de depression  uhm uhm yeah the competition is very great    very  yeah higher high competition   yeah yeah  but uhm i think in case you can't i think you you just have to equip yourself yeah in seeking a job yeah just have to do your best be optimistic   yeah i think that ' s the most important thing    uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm yeah optimistic   yeah optimism is very important  yeah   yeah  yes you should if if you are just always complaining or uhm worrying   uhm that ' s useless i think    uh uh  yeah that ' s several-words  yeah   yeah  i ' m also learning putonghua   really  yeah   i ' ve never heard you   uh   yeah but uh because i     you speak  yeah yeah because i only uhm uhm got through the uhm high  level putonghua exam at the beginning of the second semester   so i didn't do it i didn't do it uhm at the first semester   and now i am at uhm putonghua of uh higher level   yeah    ah   oh   oh  so let ' s speak in mandarin next time both-laugh  may maybe maybe we can have s uhm no how about your mandarin class yeah i i seldomly i seldomly uhm hear about  what your what ' s your opinions or impressions on your mandarin class tape change to side b     uhm  uh my my course is very intensive and uh very useful for me uh yeah but uhm i got one problem here because most of all uhm cantonese hong kong people speaks cantonese so i i don't have any chance to speak mandarin everyday  uh uh that ' s
