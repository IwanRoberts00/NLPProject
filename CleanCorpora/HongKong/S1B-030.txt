 
""
good evening and welcome to newsline
""
now that the elections are behind us
""
this  ' s time to look at what the result really mean
""
what is the impact of greater democratization
""
is the two parties system emerging in hong kong
""
to discuss this and other issues we have with us today three of the
winners of last week elections
""
fredrick fund of the association for democracy and people  ' s
livelihood who has made a dramatic come back after defeat two years ago and
who won in the direction elections
""
doctor lo wing lok the new representative of the medical functional
constituency and ambrose lau chairman of the hong kong progressive alliance
who won his seat through the election committee
""
welcome gentlemen
""
ambrose if i may start with you
""
you  ' ve been in legco longest among the three of you you  ' ve been
 there since nineteen ninety five
""
and each time you  ' ve been elected uh by the election committee
""
now next time around there won't be an election committee
""
what are you going to do 
""
""
well i think i  ' m going to stand for election again but of
course i mean there are only two routes about that time
""
  that is  either  through the functional constituency
or through direct election
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
which one   you  like
""
""
  it   
""
well i haven't quite decided yet   uh i  think the
most important thing is to make sure that uhm  i  ' m going to win next
time
""
  uh so  that that will be the an uh that will the 
parliament  the that will be the  parliament   
consideration 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uh ha  
""
so you gonna remain in politics uh and you have four years to
decide uh which route to take
""
okay fredrick let me   uh ask  you
""
you  ' re the head of of the uh  association for democracy and
people  ' s livelihood   which  is a  uh a very uh small party
""
you are the only uh member in   legislative council 
""
what do you see uh as the future of a small party uh like yours
you know uh christine lo was uh also head of a small party citizen party and
she left and out the citizen party was gradually disappear   
""
""
what you think as a future of a small party like yours 
""
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
i think we have two roads
""
one road is in in the legco  that we can have uh more chances to
talk with the decision makers like the uh secretaries   and also
 we have uhm better chance and quicker to get informations from the
government
""
uh of course i think we can voice out our opinions and ideas
""
but uh as you know we are only one vote and there  ' s also uh uh
voting systems that give us uh an an uh uh worse chance to win a a motion
""
but on the other hand we think the an another road that uh you know
we have we are  social  background that we  ' ve come from pressure
group   
""
we  did organize peoples in our areas not only our
constituency but is also in hong kong or  or some sort uh minority groups
""
uh if we can really representing their opinions ideas and their
interest we think we still go on organizing that   organizing 
them    
""
we did pressure outside and inside the the the parliament  
for the  legislature  so 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
now doctor lo you represent uh a functional constituency uh in the
legislature
""
uh the basic law said eventually uh all sixty seat will be
directly elected uh which will mean facing out all the functional
constituencies
""
are you in favour of that 
""
""
yes i  ' m in favour of that
 
""
uh uh fired facing out your job and and in fact 
""
""
yes uh basically the medical profession are in favour 
  of  uh direct election of all the seats in the legco
""
but uh what we have to decide is the timetable
""
how long would it take the chief uh direct election for all the
  seats 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 i see  
""
well that  ' s interesting because uh early last year the leaders of
the three major parties you know democratic party the dab and the liberal
party well on this programme and they all agree that by two o o eight uh the
entire legislature should be directly elected
""
uh uh would you been favour of that 
""
""
well i would i would uh  uh initiate a discussion within uh
my  one-word  within my profession the doctors and
dentists     to to to get a consensus among us
""
so  what  ' s the consensus i can give you a more definite 
 answer 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 okay  
""
so you have an open mind right now
""
  uh ambrose  what what is your view on uh full
universal suffrage for the   legislation  
""
""
 that  ' s right  
""
""
 i mean that  ' s   quite clearly done in the
basic law that uh at the end of the day we  ' ll go to have uhm direct election
for all the seats in legco
""
so uhm  again uh somebody of timing instead we have been asked
that question uhm  time and again    during  my election
campaign
""
and uhm we  ' ve been asked to uhm  to express our views and uh
 uh   per  perhaps uhm uh there there  ' s something can the
public doesn't really uh know too much about this is the fact
""
i mean uh we have a report  uh in the uh  constitutional
affairs panel    uh  publish uh in june regarding the uhm 
regarding uh political reforms
""
the uhm recommendation   is that  uhm uh uh 
relation  should be in depth study
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
when you said we you mean the legislative   council 
""
i  ' m i  ' m asking but but  your party 
""
""
 yeah that  ' s right that it  ' s it  ' s  
""
no no it uh it it uh it it it  ' s a legco panel  uh  
report 
 
""
 yes yes  
""
i  ' m asking uh what  ' s your party  ' s   position  
""
""
 i see  
""
well my party  ' s position is this uh well we we we consider it uhm
 uh of part on important and therefore we should uh the public should be
should be widely consulted
""
we should try to seek a consensus uh uh uh to say the needs
""
we should have a  uh an  a view of the public  
whether  whether the majority of the public uh would like to see uh
direct election in  ninet  in   in two  o o eight
""
uh this is important in the sense that if you do not have a have
majority view  the society can be very uh uh can be very  
 one-word  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
 so   so you follow the majority routes
""
""
of course of   course 
""
""
 but but   how how how can we know the majorities
""
  how  how how they think if you if you you accept
that we should have a a a a general election a   general  voting
polling uh for the general public so that they we can know the answer whether
they get the majority  favour or in    unfavour  
""
""
 how  
""
  gen   
""
 uh   if you look at the recommendation of the  of
the uh uh legco  ' s constitutional affairs committee which uh said that we
should we should initiate and and     uh  consultation a
  comprehensive  consultation for the public regarding uh this
reform   
""
and you see in fact it very much fact  that   these
  and  i mean these recommendations are are made by a  
penal  one-word   the panel which uh comprise i mean
uh the panel comprise comprises of a representative  var  various
parties including democratic  par  party the  par  the uh the
frontier and uh dab  democracy 
""
so i think this is something we are uh we really have to consider
very seriously
""
""
 polling  
""
 uhm  
""
""
 but you find both  elect lection   
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  uhm  
 
""
well fredrick   i  i know you  ' re trying to pin uh
ambrose down on this but let me pin you down okay
""
what is your position 
""
""
 uhm  
""
we think that we should have direct election in two o o four
 
""
two o o four    for the for the  entire
legislature    uh ha  
""
""
 yeah i think hong hong kong is  
""
 yeah i   think hong kong is
""
first hong kong i think uh  uh no matter from conditions 
criterias  uh is ready for it
""
second point is that uh it is a  pro  uh proportional
representation
""
no party can make a majority numbers     or seats
in the legco
""
so what  ' s wrong and what  ' s what  ' s what  ' s   what  ' s
worry 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh well  
""
do you do you think we should keep the proportional
representation system 
""
""
yes   if it is  small than thirty seats
 
""
 uh  
""
if if it is small if the whole legislature of the like we should
keep uh that why is that 
""
""
uh i think there we have two two type of elections in hong
kong
""
one  ' s the election of the legco another is the election of the uh
chief executive
""
and we can see that uh the chief  ex  executive is in
control of the uh uh policies or executive power
""
and the uh legco is on the on the other hand is uh as a as a watch
dog of the government    
""
and you think that the more different voice or more different
parties can participate in the legco will be the best and the proportional
 repre  representation is one of the    uh system that we
practise 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 so you  you favour   having uh a uh  large
number of parties in the legislature    
""
uhm oh instead of involving two role in two parties 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yes
 
""
i see
""
what uh i  ' m sorry what what do two of you think   yeah
 
""
""
 oh   i i believe that social consensus would take
time to emerge     and i personally i i i i don't believe
that uh by two o o four hong kong as a whole   is ready  for 
uh uh sixty seats   or  directly elected
""
we have also to consider exco
""
how is exco members   elected  how is chief executive
elected
""
you have to have a whole package   before  proceeding
to direct election of all the legco seats
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
what about proportional uh representation
""
are you in favour of keeping that or or 
""
""
well it depends on uh how we look at the function of the
legco    
""
so if we look at it as a sounding broad as a as a as a as a as a
forum for discussion proportional representation is alright
""
so if we are looking at uh legco that eventually  uh uh uh uh
uh from the the ruling say ruling party i would favour of a a a a a more
direct type of election
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
and  what  uh what do you think legco should be
""
i mean you  ' re saying if uh a then does uh b then does what do
you yourself favour 
""
""
well at the present moment there are a lot of constraints on
how legco can do
""
so at the present moment the most it can do is the sounding broad
is a forum but uh  it it won't exclude future changes
""
so it  ' s a very much of matter  of  social consensus
""
what the people   want  legco to be
 
""
 uhm  
""
uh ambrose   you  several words  ideas
 
""
""
  several words  world   i 
beg  of it
""
i think uh legco has never been a sounding broad or forum or such
as in
""
it  ' s always been uh  a legislature that is we make laws 
 we  make laws
""
we monitor  uh government policies   so 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 but   you do not initiate the processes in
legislation
""
the government is calling the sort or the   law 
""
""
 yeah   but that that is one thing
""
of   course  but uh one thing you say that it is
sounding broad of course and uh another thing you say that we we we we we are
in legislature
""
but i understand that doctor lo  emphasis perhaps is this  i
mean this is not really a so called uh legislative lead sort of government
and uhm  uh regarding your your question to to fred to to fred to fred
about uh whether there should be more parties or whether it  ' s going to be
two party     uh and and uh system in hong kong
""
i  ' m sure the  i  ' m sure that there will be more than two
parties
""
i mean uh uh you can see that so many parties in  in  
in  legco
""
and uh they they still survive
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
right we  ' ll   we  ' ll come back 
""
 i will   i will come back to this   issue
 of political parties after the break
""
don't go away we will right back  commercial break 
""
welcome back
""
we  ' re talking about the role of legco with three newly elected
members
""
ambrose before the break we  ' re talking about political parties
""
now do you think uh that we  ' re moving towards a a two parties
system that uh smaller parties like uh your party and may be fredrick fung  ' s
party will have no room and uh in future that you be absorb into the dab and
his party will be absorb into the  uh democratic party 
""
""
 you  says  still under the uh  
""
 uhm uh  
""
""
no first of all i won't say that uh mine is a small party we
are medium size we  ' ve got five legco members    
""
  and uh of course of course 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 you have five and the new one
""
i   thought there was four 
""
""
  surprise   several words 
is also one of us
""
anyway i think the   important  thing is uhm you look
at what had what is what has happen in the in the past three years
""
we we we do we do in legco had have have have small parties and uh
like fredrick fred fredrick  ' s case
""
he lost and he he come he comes back   you see 
""
so that that is that that that is an indication that small parties
can survive
""
i mean in in spite of the fact that it  ' s only one one person 
 party  it  ' s still  you know  he   got  he he
got lot of vote    
""
he got uh uh dramatic come back
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm uh fredrick what do you think
""
uh do you want to continue on on your own or would you be more
effective as part of a larger party 
""
""
of course not uh  one-word  i  ' ll
""
we don't think that we will we will be the uh the biggest party in
the coming ten years but we think we we can't uh medium size of the parties
   
""
uh this time we won uh we got one seat
""
i think next time we hope we hope hoping for the three  
three  seats
""
uh on the other hand we have uh some sort of ground  does 
supporting us is that uh we have uh  good support from the uh area and
also we have uh  quite a number of uh db members   elected 
uh
""
so we can see that uh if you have uh uh uh uh uh  some of 
people that supporting you     from the pr system
""
you  ' re quite guarantee that you have   seat 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 i   see
""
uh now doctor lo uh some uh representatives of functional
constituencies have said that they uh very often come to a situation like
they have a conflict in that they represent both the interests of their own
own constituency
""
and that  ' s both represent the interest of hong kong uh as a
whole
""
oh when if if you should uh be face of a situation like that how
would be you vote
""
would you vote for  doctors or would you vote for the hong
kong community 
""
""
now it is a election pledge that if i face with such a
situation i would vote for doctors and dentists
 
""
i   see against interest  of uh the larger  
community  
""
""
 it is my  one-word   
""
 well i   i don't see that there  ' s really  any
uh  uh uh  the conflict between the medical and dental profession and
the community at large
""
i i i don't see that  very likely to happen
 
""
but if you don't   think  it  ' s likely to happen why do
you make such a pledge 
""
""
 well  
""
well i would i what i i what what i  ' m saying of that is i would
try to serve as as a bridge   between  professions and the
community
""
and hopefully we can resolve differences and prevent such kind of
situation from occurring
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
how about chance that they uh the people in general in
general public uh people are the general public thinking that we should have
direct elections but the doctor say no in nine in two o o four
""
""
well doctor  most of  most of the doctors and dentists
agree that direct election of all the seats of legislature   should
 occur in the future
""
this is our belief
""
it is a very much a matter of timetable   so that 
discussion is not yes or no   but the matter of timetable 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 if if saying if if   if the general public saying
it  ' s okay in two o o four
""
""
so as as as the representative of the medical functional
constituency i have a   duty  to   express  yes
express the view of doctors and dentists to legislature   and 
also try to persuade both sides on uh uh uh uh uh solution    yeah
 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 persuade them  
""
 uhm  
 
""
 okay   now ambrose uh you  ' ve been in legco for
the pervious five years and unlike uh the two   guests  here
""
uh uhm a lot of people have said that the current system is not
working that uh there is a   disconnect  between the executive
and the legislature
""
how how do you feel about this 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
well this  ' s not a  spare  uh as it  ' s reported in the
press
""
well in fact uh if you look at what has happened in the past years
""
practice i mean practically all uh our legislation practically i
would say are proposed by government uh  have been passed
""
so i won't say that there there  ' s any an an any sort of uh you
know uh deadlock situation uh there is a complete lack of communication
""
but what i would like to see is that uh there will be better
communication between the the legislature and administration
""
  i mean  it all depends on on individual uh policies
uh secretaries
""
some of the some of the uh uh policy secretaries are  you know
much more open and uh uh they  ' re more willing to listen to to to views of
the public and views of the legislative council members
""
so i mean i think some of them are willing a bit uhm  a bit uh
conservative   to see  the need
 
""
 uhm  
""
 so  
""
so you think uh if the problem exist it  ' s at the secretary level
""
you don't think it  ' s at a higher level 
""
""
no i i i i don't really think so because you know uh  the
policy secretaries initiate policies and uh those are the our main  
concerns 
""
so   we  ' ve  got to make sure that their polices are
in  one-word  with   the  with with the views
of the public     and  affect  the use of the public
and good for hong kong as a whole
""
so i think we uh legislative members are very concern about you
know uhm  uh establishing a good relationship with them in a sense that
good relation in the sense   that  we know each other  
uh uh  one enough to uh to to sort of a really appreciated   uh
 the use of each other
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
doctor lo as uh someone who was new to the uh to legco do you
have any views on how you think it should function and how it should relate
to the executive 
""
""
well the obviously the chief executive should look at the
legco as uh as a partner as a  uh uh uh  org  organization  
that could help 
 
""
 do you do   you think he has not been looking at
legco as a partner 
""
""
well   si  he has been looking  at the legco as
a body to persuade as to uh spend effort in uh rather than  uh
organization that can help him uh in uh in uh implementing his  
policies
""
this is my impression 
 
""
 uhm  so  what do you think   he should do
""
should he go out legco more often uh and answer question or 
  one-word   
""
""
 yeah   that  ' s right
""
i believe the chief executive and the exco should have better
communication which with legco
