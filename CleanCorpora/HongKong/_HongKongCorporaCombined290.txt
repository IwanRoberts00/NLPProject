thank you mr chairman for your kind words yeah ladies and gentlemen i would like to talk on a previous experience in the use of uh the epcon system i hope you ' ll excuse me uh delivering my lecture in a uh sitting down yeah  first of all i would like to talk on the current situation in local garment factories sewing operators are exclusively on piece rate system rather than daily paid operators cut bundle tickets which are input in the computer by payroll 1-word  if the income of a sewing operator is adv adversely affected due to style change reduced order size or 1-word  she is compensated at the discretion of the supervisor  management staff usually composed of experienced employees promoted from the sewing floors current status of tap  in hong kong there are three factories manufacturing shirts blouses pants and outer wear with about one thousand five hundred employees  the head office of the group is in hong kong with operations also in taiwan thailand malaysia and singapore there are over twelve thousand employees in the group the progressive bundle system is used factory manager is in charge of production assisted by superintendent and pbc department having said this yeah actually we are also running some modulars group yeah in uh taiwan as well as in uh thailand  in nineteen eighty four tap engaged kurt salmon associates to install industrial engineering techniques using time-based standards standard allowed hours and percentage efficiency are now used for measuring factory performance rather than dozens produced this enables a more accurate comparison among the factories in in our group the material utilization department monitors fabric consumption in each factory to overcome turnover problem the advanced analytical method training amt was used to exercise training of new operators or retraining of existing operators statistical quality control is used to assess product quality as well as recording the quality performance of each operator so that action can be taken when necessary in nineteen eighty four tap developed apparel manufacture management information system ammis on ticket printing payroll calculation and issuing management reports  currently detailed management reports are produced daily as well as periodically on the performance of each factory as well as each section  monthly a performance report is compiled so that all the factories in our group there are ten yeah are rated on the same key indices   fac company objective of tap increased productivity reduced costs quality products good service to our customers and quick response tap electronic production control system in order to achieve our company objectives it is clear that very accurate and timely production data are required so that staff can take corresponding actions the following are useful information daily production section and factory summaries bimonthly section summaries wip status quality status in nineteen eighty four tap developed ammis which provided daily factory as well as section summary to further reduce the time in getting the key information in production so that remedial action could be taken earlier tap have a joint project with hkpc in nineteen eighty seven to develop a real time front end data capturing device in nineteen ninety tap de install the captor system an alternative to the developed device which turn out to our complete satisfaction we have now installed the system in two factories in hong kong and are now in the process of installation in the third factory and also we are preparing the work for installation in one of our overseas factories on each work place a work station with both keyboard and optical reader is installed upon completion of a bundle the operator input the data into the host network via the st work station by scanning the bar code on the ticket with the optical reader the host computer will process the data and provide information on the pay of the operator the quantity completed and the earnings et cetera this information can be displayed on the screen of the work station when required by the operator or the supervisor all transactions are initially screened on three eight six pc each of which can handle up to two hundred fifty six work stations after completion of hundred coupons the batch is sent to the novel network for updating that will take about ten minutes yeah  this new system enables the supervisors to have immediate access to the current status of production so that more timely and accurate measures could be taken  i would like to compare the uh old and the new system  basically in in the old system the aim is yeah that information are stored into a are are put into computer and then after ticket printing  this go to the sewing room the operator cut the tickets and these are input into the computer by the payroll 1-word  the computer does all the calculation all the work and generate different files you know the payment the wip and costing and also different reports and this are usually obtained next day you know so there is a time lag  on using the epcons you know instead of the the ordinary ticket printing we use the bar code yeah instead the information are take taken up with using the optical reader and these are processed in the computer and then updated uh in the network we are getting all the in uh information and data as the previous in addition there is on-line inquiries this is the most important difference so that now all the information are update and action could be taken straight away on the spot rather that uh wait  compare with the pilot system the captor has the following advantages it is more reliable it does not require individual ac ' s supply yeah so there are fewer plugs yeah the power being provided by a central device the operator will be able to obtain more information from the work station more features can be installed as required due to the interactive nature of the system the benefits of using the epcons traditionally our supervisors carry out balancing by experience  through estimating the wip in each operation and the output of individual operators even with the introduction of the ammis only data from the previous day is available epcons can provide the following information one the on and off standard efficiency of each section as well as that of individual operators uh i ' m show you some of the transparencies but actually will be  will be seen on the computer screen yeah  you got the factory we say yea it is sec it is group number section three at eleven twenty five and here are the number the operator numbers the time on standard yeah it ' s hun the uh efficiency on standard is one o three percent th another one one one two okay and the third one thirty eight these are all on standard efficiencies  if we like to check the factory as a whole then we have the different section and instead of uh operators we are checking on the different section we can compare their performance so at this factory at in the morning you know eleven fourteen forty nine group one two three four when we have the on standard as well as off standard you know efficiency so in this case the superintendent or the factory manager you know just looking the screen tape finishes on one side  wip status either selected six operation of all production orders or all operations in a po this provides significant help in line balancing first of all we can ask we ' ll ask the computer to list out the all the pos you know that is being processed you know in the factory suppose you know we want to get into detail of one particular po let say you know the one underlined you know then this is something that we ' ll get you know actually part of it you know because i ' m showing operation check point five and six these uh six checkpoint uh could be adjusted as required you know okay let ' s say for checkpoint number five and for this particular po then for the cut quantity is uh twenty four and half dozens operation number is five one four the current quantity that that is the output you know of the day until that moment is eleven dozen and uh three pieces the total quantity yeah produced is uh twenty-two and half okay  that that is the case yeah and then for checkpoint number six now we can check it one by one we know you know the output yeah at each at each uh of the checkpoints  suppose you know we would like to check you know on certain operations alone yeah what is the output yeah so let let say we want to check only for operation five one four that means uh we are talking about all the pos that has uh gone through operation five one four these are all the orders there ' s a these are the current production for the day we could say the these are zero and the cumulative are also zero because uh and the remnant yeah these that means uh haven't done yet this view i have not been pro uh this uh po have not been processed yet and then for this one the output is forty dozens accumulated is this and the balance yeah is this these two add up will be equivalent to the cut dozens  or in some case we are only interested in one particular po we want to know yeah the status of this particular po then we can check all the operations for this particular po these are the operations that we know the output for the day of this operations the summation and the remnant from this we know that uh most of the operations yeah on this screen have been completed except several of these uh here here and here okay this is very good uh if we are trying to chase up an order ah we ' ll see whether it ' s complete or not then with one look we say uh you know we only got uh several operation just a little bit uh remain to be complete the rest is done  it also offer the real time production quantity and the moving target to indicate the performance of a section this is also very useful we can set in you know all the operation that we are interested these are usually the important operations yeah let say a one collar four okay and corresponding this is uh this number yeah so one one collar four the current status you know at that moment is uh hundred and five dozens okay set top center you know the second one you know is hundred and eight okay and it also give us the target the target at that time should be hundred and one so from this we all we know that we are faster or  slower than the target but of course you know this is not complete by itself because we need to include the wip you know in each station so we are in the process of uh including this into the this uh screen you know very soon so that we know the output and we also know the wip then we know exactly what we should do you know  trace the operator responsible for a bundle instead of in case of quality problems yeah this is always a problem you know in the in in the sewing room you know when we have some problem with quality nob nobod nobody admits you know then sometime we ask the operators to in the past you know to sign you know on the ticket of this you know but now with the use of the epcon system unless she doesn't want to be paid you know otherwise everything is recorded we can trace back which operator is responsible for certain bundle overall efficiency of each section or whole facto factory much time is now saved as the supervisors can now read directly from their vdu it can be displayed in either chinese or english  if the production management makes good use of this information substantial savings can be achieved and i say this is the most important point yeah because the whole system itself only provide the relevant information whether improvement can take place or not depends on the management otherwise it ' s  2 words yeah in our factory we obtains the following benefits in productivity improvement  what we did was uh after installation of the epcon system we allow it the system to be run in the factory for a few days okay and we 2-words you know so and we were able to get the the data this represented in the by the red line after that then we 1-word to the management the factory manager the supervisors and the superintendents how they could benefit use by using the management uh the informations effectively  2-words  and then after that we again recalled the data yeah and this is the average of several days as well this is shown by the blue line the area cover you know between the red and the blue line are the gains okay and uh actually you know what happened was that in the past we understand that all the or every factory need some time for warming up as it can be seen you know early in the morning when the operator go back yeah they are still you know maybe half awake you know maybe they are chatting about some of the ve events you know they were having yeah uh if it is after a long weekend you know and there is no way of measuring the actual status but after we have shown this information to the management they know and so then how much we have lost in terms of capacity they knew what they should do you know they have to go out and do a immediate follow-up on the operators get them to work early start early because we know the biggest loss was in the initial period okay and you also almost took two hundred in the two hundred and sixty minutes you know initially this is half a day before they the factory reach its final you know efficiency for the day but in the past you know nobody could tell you know whether whether we have lost uh this uh this much or not now we could and so the supervisors they went out they did a very close follow-up of the operators and immediately you know we knew the difference and of course we can compare this section by section in this case we are showing i ' m showing the whole factory but we can compare the different section so the factory manager can can can tell the different supervisor you are doing better not doing as good
