will the united states have a men  ' s four hundred metre team at the
summer olympics in barcelona
""
it remains a question tonight after the us olympic trials in the
four hundred metres were again postponed as international officials
reconsidered a threat to ban anyone who runs against suspended world record
holder butch reynolds 
""
the four hundred metre races in new orleans have been postponed
until wednesday  to allow the president of the international amateur
athletic federation to poll the council  ' s twenty five members on whether to
waive the so-called contamination rule

the federation has threatened to ban from the olympics and suspend
for up to four years any athlete who ran the event with reynolds who is
serving a two-year suspension for a positive steroid test in nineteen ninety

reynolds has always maintained his innocence and won a
twenty-one-month battle for reinstatement when the us supreme court ruled

the education commission is proposing to spend more than
twenty-three billion dollars over the next fifteen years  to prepare hong
kong students for life and challenges in the twenty-first century
""
diana lin has details on the education commission report number
five
""
""
the report known as the ecr five is the outcome of an
eighteen-month study of the teaching profession  finding much room for
improvement over the next fifteen years in teachers  '  education status and
workload as a pre-requisite for providing hong kong students with the kind of
education they need to cope into the next century 
""
to train better teachers a new institute of education is proposed
to be formed by merging two existing establishments  offering improved
sub-degree courses and eventually degree courses 
""
education commission chairman rita fan hopes these measures will
inject new life into the teaching profession 
""
it  ' s hoped better training would upgrade teacher status 
""
the ecr five envisages a long term goal of an all-graduate teaching
profession beginning with having at least seventy-five hundred or thirty-five
percent of all primary school teachers holding degrees by the year two
thousand and seven 
""
to keep teachers happier on the job the ecr five recommends a ratio
of one teacher to twenty-two students in primary schools and one to seventeen
in secondary schools  smaller classes of thirty-five students  an
induction programme to guide new teachers through the difficult first year
""
the whole ecr five package would cost nearly two hundred and
ninety-five million dollars in the first year of implementation  totalling
twenty-three point five billion dollars over the next fifteen years 
""
whether the government would go for it says rita fan would depend
on how the public likes it
""
there will be a three-month consultation period
""
""
there is a substantial sum of money involved  but  this
is not the government spending the money
""
this is government spending hong kong people  ' s money taxpayers  '
money 
""
this is why we are consulting hong kong people
""
""
the education commission vice chairman john chan who also
happens to be the secretary for education and manpower is all behind the
report
""
""
it will be my duty now to seek within the government  ' s
resource allocation system  the resources necessary for the report to be
implemented
""
""
but the executive council will have the final say 
""
diana lin tvb news
""
""
political groups and education specialists have welcomed the
recommendations in the report  but there are questions about the funding
and the pace in implementing the proposals
""
carmen luk reports
""
""
the united democrats find the spirit and direction of the
number five report commendable but are unhappy with the timetable for
implementation
""
they hope the government will go ahead and carry out the proposals
as soon as possible 
""
another liberal political group meeting point shares the same
feeling 
""
it says now is the time that the government should pay back the
debt it owes to education and there should be no more excuse of a lack of
funds 
""
but the cooperative resources centre says the money factor is
important 
""
though happy with the recommendations the group has reservations
giving them its full support until further studies on the numbers
""
""
and therefore it would have a a very serious financial
implication as far as the demand on the government budget because uh other
departments such as social welfare housing uh hospitals they would all have
uh very stringent demand on government budget
""
""
education minister cheng kai ming says the major issue now is
how to solve the teachers problem  and the report has addressed that
""
""
i agree with the direction of training uh  graduate
teachers more graduate teachers but i i would say that there should be a kind
of uh target date when we will stop admitting non-graduate teachers
