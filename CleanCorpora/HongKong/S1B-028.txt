welcome back to newsline
""
one person died this week during the torrential rain which hit hong
kong on wednesday
""
schools offices and parents were confused over the new rainstorm
warning system
""
so how can it be improved
""
here to answer some of the criticisms is education department
spokesman lucas chan and from the royal observatory we have yk chan
""
good evening to you both
""
  uhm  mr chan from the royal observatory perhaps i could
start with you first
""
uhm why is it that the royal observatory failed to forecast this
torrential rain
""
you were forecasting in the morning that by lunchtime the rain
would have cleared away and it would be uhm clear sunny spells in the
afternoon 
""
   uhm   
""
""
uhm  tut  i think uh we have to regret that uh we made
a mistake and our forecaster was over  optimis  optimistic
""
and uh but the general trend you see is for improvement
""
and it is usually in this time of the year we have an very long
episode of rain for ten or to twenty days and then we will have a a quite
fine spell after that
""
  and  so after wednesday we do have an improvement
""
""
 but it  
 
""
but can you afford   to make  mistakes like this 
when people  ' s lives are put at risk 
""
""
 and uh  
""
uhm i think uhm  it is very uh difficult to forecast the exact
timing of the rain and so uhm uh that is why we have to have the rainstorm
warning system which deal with such situation
""
""
yeah well may be the improvement which you are making or
trying to make are not happening fast enough because uh last year we had
several deaths and this year the experience is repeated
""
now if i could turn to mr lucas chan uhm you  ' re responsible for
for uhm the the the warning to schools   and  you have to work very
closely with the royal observatory
""
are you happy with the kind of assistance that you  ' ve been getting
""
""
 uhm  
""
yes  in  indeed we depend entirely on the information from
the royal observatory
""
uh they gave us the warning at about uh half-past eleven within
three minutes we gave out the warning of closure of schools
""
and uh that uh i think we we are quite satisfied you know because
as soon as we received the red signal alert then we within three minutes we
gave out the closure order
 
""
but do you think you receive the red signal early enough 
""
""
well our our our uh from our constant meeting with them we
have made a arrangement that uh it is only when the red signal is up then we
should close our schools
""
""
yah   it 
 
""
 it  ' s   all very well saying you  ' re going to close
the schools but if you put out an announcement saying you  ' re the schools and
all the children still in the school what happens then
""
there is no clear guideline as to what the school action the
school should take or what action the parents should take 
""
""
there is there is as a matter of fact we sent out two
guidelines last year
""
you know  ac  actually  a  at the beginning of the
school year we usually send out circulars advising schools what to do in case
of typhoons cyclones and the and the heavy rainstorms
""
and they have got clear guidelines as to what actions the schools
should take
""
for example  st  pupils should stay in school until it is
save enough to go out into the streets to go home
""
now that   is  explained  
 
""
 but have those made clear   on the public
announcements such as made over the radio and television 
""
""
uh that wasn't made clear but every school receive a guideline
and the schools have been advised to tell the parents also these guidelines
""
and i immediately i had contacted a few schools and i checked and
indeed some schools had informed the parents but perhaps some schools do not
uh uh uh  ha ha  have left this out
""
""
i i think the difficulty is this
""
i think we would all like to be full-warned  before uhm the
rainstorm or thunderstorm comes to hong kong
""
i think once the students the pupils are at school   and
 the whole thing becomes much more complicated
""
then the principle or the   headmaster  would have to
make a decision   as  to whether to ask them to go home or  f
 force them to stay within the school premises until the rainstorm uh has
gone off
""
so   it  ' s it  ' s  not it  ' s not going to be an easy
decision even with those guidelines
""
  do you think 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yes it is  
""
 right  
""
 i think  
""
 yes   i think sally is right in a way
""
i think perhaps uh uh with  two words  perhaps
next time when we issue the the the warning over the media you can tag on
another sentence
""
students are to stay in school until everything is clear when it is
safe enough to go home you know so that to so as to remind the principals
that the students should stay in   school 
 
""
 because   at the moment you  ' ll passing about to the
individual schools or principals to take the action and to carry out the
advice which you give
""
the advice isn't coming directly from your department which it
should do 
""
""
oh no oh no because because every school in every district we
have the locality there and the situation may be different   you see
 of 
 
""
  over  there has been   some flexibility but
  i mean  if you  ' re setting out guidelines as to what should be
done you will pass theses all to the schools whether they implement these
guidelines 
""
""
 that  ' s right  
""
the the the the the the implementation of the guidelines must rest
on the principal of the school because it is he who knows the road situation
the transport situation and the rainstorm situation of that particular area
""
""
uhm  mis  mr y k chan perhaps i could   put 
the next question to you
""
and that is in cases of real emergency say you  ha  you have
a thunderstorm uh like you did on wednesday uhm what sort of channels of
communication are there for that very important piece of information to
filter through to the relevant government departments the police civil aid
transport and so on and so forth
""
""
 yes  
""
uhm i think there are altogether three channels
""
uh for the very important departments like education department we
contact them directly by telephone and fax at the same time
""
and then the second channel is of course we will contact the uh
information services department at the same time and they will contact their
list of departments
""
and the third one is the hong kong telephone company
""
they will contact uh again their list of   department
""
also  by fax   or by  teleph  
""
""
 yeah  there was a  
""
 there was a   story last week that the hong kong
examination authority was unable to get through to you because the the
switchboard of the royal observatory was jammed
""
""
uh i think uhm uh there is a some misunderstanding
""
first if all the  uh rainstorm warning uh was issued and
disseminated to the examination authority but they want further advice and so
they phoned in but they can't get through
""
""
  yeah it 
""
""
 and   so that is the they want additional
information but they cannot get through
""
""
  yes 
""
""
 that is     the 
""
""
 so   so the system is not interactive if i i may
use that word
""
if if they want to get uhm a clearer picture
""
if they want to put questions to you they are not able to do so
under present arrangement
""
and perhaps   there  ' s we should have looking into 
""
""
 but you see we have uh   altogether three
telephone lines uh in front of our of our forecaster
""
that means uh he has to answer three telephones at the same time
 already
 
""
do you think there are ways in which the actual rainstorm warning
system could be improved
""
it is quite confusing i mean although the public don't know there
are actually four signals there  ' s a green and a red black
""
obviously the first two of uh internal use but it it is a
complicated system
""
do you think of ways which could be simplified 
""
""
uh i don't think so
""
i think at the present the two-stage warning system is quite
adequate   because 
 
""
 but   actually a four-stage    one word
 isn't  it 
""
""
 before  
""
yes uh it is a four  colours but the colours are divided into
two stages
""
  the  first stages consist of two which is not
disseminated to public but it is  di  uh it will be disseminated to
the government departments
""
and so in fact we welcome the government departments to call us
anytime
""
for for example the education department the consultation with the
royal observatory started in fact really early in the morning
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm huh 
""
""
very much before the happening of a rainstorm
""
when they received the first two stages  the uh the preparatory
stages the consultation started already
""
 yup
""
""
and so i think uhm we need a similar arrangements before uh we
can have uh quick enough uh reaction
""
""
let let me bring bring you back to a point you made earlier
uhm when you said a mistake was made  unidentified speech 
""
uhm why was a mistake made
""
uh is that because you did not have  sophisticated equipment to
to you know   forecast  the weather properly
""
""
 no no no  
""
  i think uhm 
""
""
 could could you   not have uhm let us know that
uh you know this major thunderstorm was brewing and let people   should
""
""
""
 uh   i think   the equipment  is
adequate
""
of course you can always have better equipment you see but the
improvement over the additional equipment may not be that much
""
and uhm in fact it is at the present stage i think nobody in the
world can forecast uh very exactly uh when the thunderstorm or the heavy
rainstorm is going to stop within five to six hours
""
and so what we forecast is the uh rainstorm will stop uh around
noon time but in fact it stopped late in afternoon
""
  i think it is uh 
""
""
 should take precautions  
 
""
 it didn't stop all day   really 
""
""
within
""
but that is very light rain   afterwards 
""
  and so 
""
""
 is  
""
 is there   much cooperation between us here in hong
kong and uh surrounding  uh territories like guangdong shenzhen  
macau 
""
""
 yes yes   yes
""
""
and do you not share information     be  
""
""
""
 we   share information
""
  we always 
""
""
  but but   but even with their help you were
not able to forecast uh the weather exactly
""
""
uh so you see uh it depends on uh when the forecast was
issued
""
it uh for instance for this case uh on tuesday and it is not easy
to issue a very exact forecast
""
but on the morning of wednesday we did warn the department because
  we issued 
""
""
 at at   what time did you warn the  
departments 
<$a
""
 i   uh in fact we issued the flood warning at
ten  at ten o'clock
 
""
mr lucas chan you said earlier this week that in fact you are
going to be reviewing the procedures which are to be undertook when the
rainstorms warnings were hoisted
""
what exactly are you going to be doing 
""
""
well uh uhm  tut   first of first of all i think
uhm at the beginning of each school year we issue  ci  circulars
""
and i think may be you know june is about ten months after theses
circular
""
perhaps we should issue another circular every year before the
rainstorm season and that is one we uh we have just done
""
as a matter of fact  one-word  last friday we
issued again this similar circular to remind the schools and remind the
parents what to do
""
and uh perhaps then uh we we may uh  at the next uhm
announcement you know typhoon announcement we may tag on this uh line telling
the the the the the schools to let the children to stay in school instead of
letting them lose out in the  in in  into the streets
""
uh and then there are of course a couple of domestic arrangements
which i won't go into detail
""
we must add on another emergency team et cetera that these are 
 domestic  arrangements
""
""
 uhm  
""
uh
 
""
so on the whole you are actually satisfied  the way the system
work this   last time even  though one person died and the royal
observatory failed to forecast the weather 
""
""
 well bearing in mind  
""
no bearing in mind this black signal this was the first time i
think as far as the schools are concerned you know i think i think we are
relatively satisfied i think
""
""
but there  ' s the fact that you may have examinations
important examination     like the hkcee   which
 of course affects a lot of uh students
""
  does  that fact affect your decision to to go ahead
with classes go ahead with the exams because you don't want to  
reschedule its particular subject 
""
""
 yes  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 no no it  ' s quite quite   quite independent because
we make our decisions relating to schools
""
the hong kong examination authority make their own decision about
hkcee examinations and overseas examinations
""
it is a very very difficult uh decision for them to make because
it involved with a lot of logistics
""
""
right
""
""
involve   overseas  examinations
 
""
 well   
""
""
so you could have a situation where the schools will be
closed but the exams will go on
""
""
that   happened  last week
 
""
 well  
""
well i think we  ' ll have to bring the end of the discussion there
""
that ends this edition of newsline
""
will be back at the same time next week
""
join us then
""
good evening  
""
""
""
but the more important question of course is that which mr
fung raised   uh  at the end of uh the you know   the
 answer to sally  ' s question which is  will ud and meeting point 
 eventually  shift its position towards china
""
you know in nineteen ninety seven china   is  going t
be the sovereign power  uh adpl uh takes a softly-softly approach if i may
call it that
""
i think meeting point and udhk uh take a tougher stance  
  uh they they uh they are more insistence on first  
principles  now in time  given that we  ' ve got three years and a bit
is that likely to change
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
[ 4> uhm  
""
[ 5> uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
well when uh the core members of meeting point and udhk discussed
about this idea of forming the new democratic party we have indeed discussed
uh the stand towards china
""
we  ' ve all agreed that hong kong is going to be part of china in
nineteen ninety seven
""
uh uh there  ' s no question that hong kong and china should get
closer uh to each other
""
uh we had to develop some kind of working relationship with the
chinese authorities
""
we have to open dialogue communication with china
""
we hope that dialogue can be constructive
""
but at the same time we have maintained the need to be critical
""
i mean we cannot simply accept anything that china decides
""
i mean we  ' re one country two systems therefore we must be very
firm on things that are crucial to hong kong  ' s interest that are important
to hong kong and at the same time uh beneficial to china
""
so that is our main stand
""
and i don't think that uh main stand is not acceptable to china
""
but of course uh when a new party is formed we have to uh develop
a more detailed policy and channel
""
this we are going to do in the next few months
""
""
  but 
 
""
 uhm   will that reflect may be a softening of the
udhk  ' s approach and line towards china 
""
""
uh well i think it it would be unfair i mean for for us not
to judge whether uh the new party will be softer or harder than existing
parties
""
i think that is up to the public to to to see
""
""
i want to have two points
""
the first point is that the the some members of atpo decrees uh
four proposals in the  e  uh egm but uh two of them are being turned
down
""
uh only you know the ratio is quite so great that is four to
thirty
""
and it  as  abstained
""
the first point
""
so uh as atpo we we don't accept that two points
""
the second point is i i want to answer uh ms sally  ' s early
question
""
uh why you want to join it even within three years
""
we think that this now we got uh     uh seven members
being invited by the china in different consultative body  if we join them
we got three from meeting point seven from atpo
""
and then we got all elected legco member  fou   al 
altogether will be eighteen
""
and sixteen uh from municipal council
""
a hundred from  mi  from district board members
""
is a quite a strong body that we can face
""
and we should put together to face nineteen ninety seven problem
""
china either accept it or you bid them
 
""
 uhm
