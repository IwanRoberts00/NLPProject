local conservationists are up in arms over the approval of a
wetlands area for construction 
""
the developers argue they would put aside some space for nature
protection but the world wide fund for nature says that  ' s not enough 
""
jenny lam reports
""
""
the mai po wetlands form a most unique habitat for more than
three hundred species of birds 
""
in recent years their number has gone up because many are forced
out of china as guangdong surges in industrial growth
""
but their feeding ground in hong kong is now under threat 
""
num sang wai the wetlands area just next door to mai po has been
approved for development 
""
conservationists say that sets a precedent for building up in the
area and leave the birds nowhere to go
 
""
a lot of the wildlife found around mai po they depend on wetlands
""
uhm in particular there are a number of species such as the
black-faced spoonbill which is in an internationally endangered species
""
there are only three hundred and fifty left in the world  and
every winter we have seventy-four at mai po
""
and these species depend on the fishpond as a feeding habitat 
""
""
the developers want to turn this into a luxurious residential
district
""
in return they will put aside some space for a nature reserve in
nearby  lap chau 
 
""
the  lap chau  nature reserve is designed so that when the
high tide high tide comes along all the birds can have an additional high
tide  roof  and we hope that they can use and feed in lap chau 
""
""
but the conservationists argue that is not good enough 
""
what they want is long-term commitment to nature protection by the
government
""
both britain and china are signatories to the ramsar convention
which means they are obliged to designate a wetlands area for conservation
""
""
but environmentalists say the hong kong government has no clear
policy on the protection of this kind of habitat 
""
the town planning board which approved the num sang wai development
says it is working on conservation
 
""
the planning department is trying to seek funds to conduct
research about the ecology of the area and we are also looking at the need to
 one-word  whether there is a need to revise the
guidelines for application for development within the mai po nature reserve
area 
""
""
but that is expected to take some time and until that happens
a last resort for hong kong  ' s flora and fauna is in danger of disappearing

a new trend in animal farming is catching on in in guangdong 
and some hong kong farmers are definitely not burying their heads in the sand
about what could be a lucrative alternative to keeping pigs or poultry 
""
keeping ostriches is not only cheaper than pig or poultry farming
""
these giants from africa are also more environmentally friendly
""
""
they are vegetarians and so their  waste contain  less
nitrates than those of chickens or pigs

starting an ostrich or emu farm can be costly 
""
a breeding bird is worth around three hundred thousand hong kong
dollars  but a female produces on average eighty eggs a year  and more
than half of those will hatch into chicks  the birds not only offer a
low-cholesterol culinary experience  their skins are also sought after by
leather goods manufacturers in china

ostrich farming has been a success in guangdong so far   but
 hong kong  ' s climate might cause problems  speech

but for  name  switching to ostriches is a
serious consideration

if it all proves financially viable then farmers like name may
