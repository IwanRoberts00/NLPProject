""
i have for you a handout at the back of the room
""
in fact the office staff made a slight mistake it  ' s a handout for
next week  ' s lecture and this morning  ' s lecture uh in is taken for next week
""
so this morning  ' s lecture uh you will have a handout ready by next
week but i think a lot of you are in the course of writing your second essay
""
therefore the handout may be helpful and i have requested the office
staff to do the handout today if they can
""
so uh starting from tomorrow thursday you can go to the department
office and collect a handout on prosodic features suprasegmental features
""
there are three or four sheets attached to that particular handout
""
do you understand what i mean
""
if you don't remember to go or you don't need it for your essay
don't worry we will do that next week
""
i  ' ll still bring the handout in next week
""
but just in case there are some of you who are in the course of
writing your essay and you have difficulty finding references
""
it  ' s a handout on prosodic features suprasegmental feature that
should be useful i  ' ll leave it right as up tomorrow
""
we  ' ll after to do it today so you can pick that one up
""
uh this morning i pass around a handout uh the top sheet is a very
simple one
""
it  ' s the introductory sheet to what these terms are and then you
have a number of uhm different things describe for you on the other handouts
which you can either collect at the back of the room at the end of the class
and i have some copies being pass around in the meantime
""
there is no hurry because we will be discussing these processes
affecting the pronunciation of words in a context uh next week
""
you won't have time to do it this week 
""
before i proceed uh uh another announcement today i am afraid you
will have to work a little harder because i have uhm done some asking among
my students because i didn't get a chance to see other students
""
you don't come to me a tutorial and that is uh time is running out
uh we only have another week left and i have quite number of topics to cover
""
but i did promise at the beginning of the semester that i will give
you a summary revision class uh at the end of the semester during which i
will discuss with you uhm  what the examination format should be what the
questions would look like and if you see question like these how should you
answer them uh how do we plan our answers and so on
""
uh i have checked with a number of you and have come to the
conclusion that may be if we extend our teaching for another week uh it would
be in order
""
because my other choice is to hold this special class next april
""
next april will mean a course after you  ' ve done your revision uh
that will be a good idea also
""
but then on the other hand if you put your things aside for so long
you probably uh   tut  will be less  one-word 
in that  ' s what some of you think
""
so uh the general idea is to be if we have this class immediately
after the lecture finish things are still fresh in your mind
""
unless there is any serious objection to that we would have an
extra class on the sixteen of december
""
i know it  ' s  the vacation i know it  ' s near christmas but that  ' s
my christmas present for all of you   laughter 
""
meaning it is strictly voluntary if you didn't like the present
don't take it
""
if you feel it like a present just come along and i promise you it  ' s
a big present 
""
so same time this room extended for another week wednesday december
the sixteen unless there is any serious objections
""
now this morning i would like to continue with our discussion on
problems related to the  analysis and classification of english speech
sounds
""
uh would someone at the back that please close the door 
""
i may need to go to the broad there and so uh if you can't hear me
you tell me 
""
we mention last time that in the study of the english sound system
""
""
the basic things to do is a course to attempt to divide a sound
into classes category groups
""
but in the course of doing that we run into difficulties and our
intention this morning is to see what some of these difficulties are some of
these problems that we encounter
""
that  ' s why the topic is problems of phonological analysis and
classification
""
last time i mentioned briefly there are two kinds of problems
""
the first kind of problem i think relates basically to the use of
terms vowel and consonant
""
if you like you could call these definitional problems  a long
pause 
""
first of all we started with the assumption at the very beginning
of our course that a sound belongs to one of two categories either it is a
vowel or it is a consonant that was our first assumption in the study of
phonetics 
""
how do we define a term vowel
""
we gave it a phonetic definition and we gave it a linguistic
functional definition
""
we also gave the term consonant a phonetic definition and a
linguistic definition
""
now base on these definitions we will very happy to establish
twenty four consonant families and twelve vowel families include uhm and
twenty vowel families including twelve pure vowels and eight diphthongs and
that was what we started on with
""
now we want to go and see if there are any problems related to this
kind of description this kind of definition
""
the first problem i can think of relate to something which we call
the syllabic consonants  a long pause 
""
one of our definitions the functional one told us that a vowel has
a central syllabic function it forms the nucleus of the syllable
""
a consonant has a marginal syllabic function it is non-nuclear it
cannot form a syllable by itself but it can only occur with a vowel to form
syllable
""
now the vary occurrence of syllabic consonant upset this particular
assumption that we made
""
why because you still remember a syllabic consonant is such that it
forms the nucleus of syllable in words like bottle the second syllable in
words like button the second syllable
""
you have syllabic l in bottle you have syllabic n in button
""
in both cases you have two syllables to each word but the second
syllable contains no vowel at all
""
the second syllable in the first case contain the syllabic
 one-word 
""
in the second case the second syllable contain syllabic 
one-word 
""
so this is one problem which we encounter in the course about
definition and that is our functional linguistic definition tells us that a
vowel is the nucleus of syllable a consonant is the margin of syllable but
this is a problem because we have a class for syllabic consonant
""
so theoretically this is a  contradictional  terms because
we say consonant cannot be syllabic so we have this exception
""
now our idea here is not necessarily to find solutions because a
lot of these things  this will  cannot be solved but our intention is
to see what problems there are
""
same thing that you will dealing with the english syllable
""
we list the problems but we may not be able to solve the problems
and if you one day are able to solve all these problems you become very
famous professor somewhere in the world
""
now then also related to your definitional problems in related to
vowel and consonant
""
we said english speech sound could be grouped into one or two
categories vowel or consonant
""
our question now is is this true
""
there is a group of english speech sound specifically called the
semi-vowels 
""
the semi-vowels  one-word  and 
one-word 
""
if you look at first of all the title of this category they are
called semi-vowel
""
so by definition if it is semi-vowel it  ' s also a semi-consonant
""
semi means half in other words this is a group of sound that
partakes of both set of characteristics
""
they are vowel liked and they are consonant liked
""
why did we put these into the category called consonant because we
simply wanted to streamline our analysis
""
we wanted to make life easy but in real terms the 
one-word  and  one-word  are such that they are
vowel like in certain respects you remember from our analysis last week
""
they are consonant like in other respects and on balance we found
that  the weight is heavier on the consonant side so just put them into
the consonant family but we could well have put them into the vowel family as
well
""
as a result of that this category contributes a problem and that is
our two terms vowel and consonant may not be sufficient to describe the
sounds we have in english
""
perhaps we need a third group you give it whatever name you like
you call it group x whatever name you like and this group would include
marginal sounds like the semi-vowels which are half vowels half consonant and
henceforth we don't want to just put them into any category for pleasure
""
so here we have a challenge to the first of all linguistic
definition of a terms
""
second the phonetic approach to the terms
""
any solutions you can think of our solutions as i said there is a
lot of democracy in the world these days
""
anything we say any ideas we come up with is right to a certain
extend in consequence of that we don't need other people to give us solutions
""
we can think of our own solution but there is one phonetician who a
long time ago suggested doing in this way and this phonetician is k l pipe
""
you do not necessarily need to agree with him
""
you may agree you may disagree but it is just a proposal
""
he suggested the best way to save us from this trouble is simply to
divide our sounds in two ways
""
one group you call it  the linguistic group the other group we
call it the phonetic group
""
and we will give these two groups new names
""
the linguistic categories he will call them vowel consonant
""
the phonetic categories he would call them  vocoid   and
 contoid   a long pause 
""
what is the essence of this
""
by doing so every time we look at sound that we want to analyze we
would look at its linguistic characteristics and its phonetic characteristics
""
for example a vowel like r will be linguistically a vowel because
it has central syllabic function phonetically it  ' s a  vocoid 
""
this is the phonetic characteristics
""
a vowel like  one-word  p will be linguistically
a consonant because it has a marginal syllabic function but phonetically a
 contoid  it has consonantal characteristics in phonetic nature
""
but if you take a consonant like the  one-word 
in little the second l in little where it is syllabic
""
then linguistically it is a vowel because it has central syllabic
function but phonetically it is a  contoid 
""
now i repeat that for example you look at the word little  and
you transcribe this word first
""
the  li    tle  with the syllabic l that  ' s the
way to transcribe the word
""
if you look at the first  one-word  sound in
little this one is linguistically a consonant because it has the marginal
syllabic function phonetically it is a  contoid  because it has
obstruction to the air stream et cetera et cetera
""
but if you look at the second l the same kind of l sound 
several words 
""
this is the  one-word  syllabic l little the
 one-word 
""
in addition to its phonetic characteristics linguistically this is
not a consonant this is a vowel because it has a central syllabic function
""
it forms the nucleus of the second syllable but phonetically it  ' s
still a  contoid  because it is still fulfils the obstruction to the
air stream to produce naturally with air coming up at the side of the tongue
""
so this is one way of solving our problem and that is every time
you see a sound you will then divide it into a linguistic class and the
phonetic class and this is k l pipe suggestion
""
then in conclusion when it comes to definitional problems these
are the things we can think of 
""
then the second group of problems relate to the establishment of
phoneme establishment of phoneme means  a long pause 
""
last time i probably use the term vowel consonant dichotomy in the
first type of problem
""
so whatever i said is the same thing
""
it has to do with using the terms vowel and consonant to describe
your english sound any problems with the definition that  ' s the meaning of
first kind of problems
""
the second kind of problems  third of  problem that i can
think of relate to the establishment of phoneme
""
in other words we want to ask yourself  ourself  should
there be forty four phonemes in english
""
should there be less than forty four or should there be more than
forty four
""
and in this respect we tend to look at what we call marginal
sounds
""
marginal sound refer to those sound which are on the margin
meaning you can either say yes or you can say no to these sound that  ' s the
meaning of marginal sound okay
""
now let  ' s look at some of the problems related to the
establishment of phonemes 
""
one of the problems we can think of i think relate to certain
marginal sounds which do not fulfill all our criteria  for the
establishment of phonemes
""
so in discussing this particular subject the first thing to do is
of course to list those factors which are  useful in helping us establish
phoneme families
""
what are the criteria we use when we try to group sounds into
families of phonemes
""
some of the criteria are number one that particular sound group
must have a high frequency of occurrence in the language meaning they occur
all the time in language
