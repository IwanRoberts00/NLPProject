well where can you find them   actually we can find them is uh example that i working in the bank  some people and uh set the time to interview this uh person   oh  oh one-word     actually sometimes we ' ll go to their house  because they have no time they ' re busy so night time we go to their house and interview them  wow so lace    yeah  they are professionals   yeah  wow they are so nice   so nice they are really  well they are so nice because   are they helpful    yeah yeah  uhm uhm because i think     because we explained to them the  situation uh we explain to them that we need in school   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   so they say it ' s okay   so they share us about their life because we ask questions and they will answer us   uhm   laughs  but i think uh the situation in hong kong is different    when you if you ask them they will just ignore you  and send you out  laughs   one-word  ignore you really i think so because but uh the matter is uh depends on how long the interview is  if it ' s uh quite short or just  last a few minutes i think they can bear    oh   uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm     uhm   but any longer than that i don't think  laughs they will they ' re willing to help oh the situation of our s uh of our university is quite different uh because the uh most of the professors are uh quite uh helpful and they ' re willing to help and they will uh if you are familiar with them uhm you can uh uhm sit down and and have tea and speak up and dubbed the  tape  yes     uhm uhm   oh   yeah yeah yeah   yeah  i think the situation in u is quite different from  outside because outside people are really very busy others laugh and they can't afford to uh spend the time  for us in this way    uhm   uhm uhm     uhm uhm  uhm uhm yeah but uh people in philippines is so good la    yeah   yes  i i ' m i remember that the brothers and sisters in the philippines uh uhm like to uh sing and like to dance    yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  in hong kong also laughs because voice breaks off yeah so nice and we have uhm we plan to have a hymns appreciation meeting on next   sunday on the uh joint joint gathering   uhm uhm     yeah   sunday   gathering   what is it about it ' s about the bro uh sisters will uh prepare the song which is uh which are composed by them  or uh written by them in the tracks the words  uhm uhm     uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm and in on that day they will uh share and sing along and we prepare it we planned we planned to prepare for the tracks first   so that uh on that day they can follow easily and   sing together if it is possible  and   uhm uhm     aw   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm and the tracks uh will the tracks be uh printed out  yeah we plan to do so    yeah  uhm uhm but uh it ' s uh i i think it ' s a problem of collection of the  of the tracks of the hymns because uh we can only collect it on sunday then the last day is yesterday  $b laughs  today is monday     yeah   uhm     yeah it ' s too long two-words   yeah it ' s too late   but anyway we try to memorize it  yeah or maybe     because it ' s nice also if we ' re all we are already there in one-word and we are holding the company up actually we think it that is a contest uh  uh huh  aw     so that we we say that we must memorize it  oh yeah but i mean the audience also maybe they also can sing along  in the atmosphere will wah  very good and harmony     yeah   but i think uh josephine have a solo but it was composed by her it ' s very nice   yeah   wah  she just like her sister marjorie  she both of them can compose songs     yeah   yeah   songs yeah   uhm uhm and which is very nice  one of uh one of marjorie ' s song hymn i mean is uh in also included in the english hymn book  uhm uhm  uhm uhm yeah and wah the song is nice uhm yeah and uh     i think very good  back to the point uh we plan to uh have that song uh sung together in the appreciation meeting  uhm uhm  uhm    wah so  and we plan to give them a surprise    one-word now i know  $b and $z laugh  no i mean to also also to uh brothers and sister in on other districts on   yeah yeah  because uh we have three groups island group uh tuen mun group and shatin group uhm uhm and island group will sing that song and we  give a surprise to shatin group and tuen mun group  uhm uhm   uhm uhm tape cuts off and resumes  you uh join uh this program this i mean this project this uh international corpus project   uhm yeah well i think uh it ' s quite interesting to uh join in the  this worldwide uh project  and because i ' m uhm studying english and especially the  varieties of english uhm i need to uh collect uh sorry i need to i need to uh collect uh many uhm english   uh many englishes from uh different uhm nationalities  uhm uhm     uhm   uhm uhm   oh it ' s okay   uhm    oh i see  uhm uhm   yes tape cuts off and resumes  really you too    yeah   you ' ve studied science which subject   oh science no because it ' s one-word  actually we study we study this  for example education as a teacher  you go to this uh minor subject  if you want to major in science you go to this science you want to go major chemistry it ' s like this  uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   oh   oh   uhm  so you have a   basic it ' s only a basic  oh uhm uhm you your major is english   but uh you take other science subject as minor  just     yeah  yeah  oh have you study mathematics   yeah my minor is mathematics  $z and $b laugh  i ' m scared of mathematics   very   wow   why   yeah so do i so difficult     yeah yeah yeah  it ' s very difficult though though i ' m science student i  i find it difficult to   you are a science student yes all laugh   if i ' m not how one word english   why why do you study english in the city u because i like eng  don't be so angry  because i like i like english yes because i actually i like language and i ' m willing to learn and i find that uh it this uh  one reason that i like english the other reason is that uh my science subjects are so poor  $b and $z laugh  because my result also shows that uhm my language  subject is much more much better than my science subjects   so it indicated that i didn't i didn't  take the wrong choice  and you know right now the choice i mean uh the course that i have taken is uh my fir first choice of my uh priority  laughs sorry   uhm   uhm uhm   oh     better than science subjects   uhm uhm uhm uhm   you ' re good at   oh     uhm uhm   uhm uhm  what ' s it  english   english  english for professional communication  it ' s a kind of language and you also learn about communication also and the society with the communication and the communication something like that  and i think it ' s  i find it very funny though the workload is very heavy  oh   uhm uhm     yeah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm and you ' ll learn uh more yeah yeah yeah   much more english  every kinds of english and  yeah and also  and also i i learn about people and how to communicate what kind of people i am and uh in what way shall i communicate with others so that uh   no to minimize so that the the chance of uh misunderstanding to happen is minimize  yes it ' s quite funny    uhm   uhm uhm     uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm     uhm  uhm    yeah   and it ' s uh useful i think  yeah  very useful uhm uhm     yeah  but this year it ' s not the hit choice it ' s not a hit choice to choose this course   you know it depends on how hit the course   the courses are so that people will choose  oh     uh   uhm uhm     uhm  uhm uhm   uhm uhm  and this year it ' s not a hit choice  why did i say that because uh all my groupmates i have uh twenty groupmates including me twenty-one and uh all of them uh go through the jupas system to go in uh  and then uh they make choices also  uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm but uh some of them take took this course  as the as their last choice  uhm uhm   last choice     uhm   aiya  who you know you know what i mean  then well it proves that it ' s not a hit choice at all    but uhm    yes   uhm uhm  uhm then what ' s the most uh hit choice uh in the u uh in this university  uhm i don't know i don't know  maybe  you don't you don't know  electronics yeah somewhat like that or mechan   oh    mechanical  yeah engineering i mean yeah     yeah engineering   engineering  it ' s quite hit to in the both here city  university and polytechnic university  uhm  oh because the polytechnic before beforehand is uh i mean before it ' s both of this u are called  polytechnics only   uhm   uhm uhm    uhm  but you know in polytechnics i feel that uh the  science subject s especially the engineering  is uh much more practical than the universities  i mean the hku cu  uh i don't mean to   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm     uhm   uhm   yes uh most of our subjects  $z laughs  never mind   yeah i don't mean to uh set down your u uh $z laughs  well i uh i uhm i think so because uh most of our subjects uh especially the science subjects for example the mathematics the the chemical or the  the physics  uhm uhm    chemistry  chemistry yes chemistry and physics uhm most of them are composed of uh theories    uhm   uhm  and there are uh the theories are quite uh abstract  uhm uhm uhm most  uhm most often  very often and  $b and $z laugh do you know uh adeline chan adeline chan and  uhm uhm  chan chan ga chan ka lai chan ka lai yes in hong kong u yes uh with quite pale face and a bit fat and long hair big eyes yes yeah i know her the girl  and she studied in our s our  institutions uh in year one and she studied uh mathematics and she she uh she said that she she uh quite uh confused with the theories  and mathematics uh is the most uh hard-working  laughs groups in the in our institution and it ' s uhm demanding  i think the faculty is very demanding too oh laughs uhm the sisters   uhm   oh   oh   uhm     uhm   harsh to go yes uh it ' s harsh and there are many test and quiz  uhm so the sisters studying in the faculty are both getting much uh laughs uh thinner and thinner  uhm   thinner and thinner  weaker and weaker yes paler and paler all laugh  and and i i always uh see them in the library  uh they ' re studying the mathematics yes they ' re hard-working and most uhm very often they do not have lunch  uhm   studying studying working working    uhm  uhm uhm   uh i can't bear    uhm uhm me also   one-word  oh just uh in the uh last uh in the fine is it in the   the end of the year    two-words  uhm  aw yes near the examination day near the examination day but uhm uhm in uhm  very often they are hard-working yes yes tape cuts off and resumes  uh geography in the first year is quite boring but uhm it ' s  much more difficult uh in the second year and third year because the second year uh there is a field trip uhm over broad uh abroad  uhm    quite interesting and good  a good chance to learn more   yeah   uhm  uhm yeah they ' ll have a good experience   uhm uhm  uhm yeah but oh i don't think i will have this chance  $b and $z laugh because i ' ve i ' ve already given it to my sister in flesh my  you know i have a twin sister twin sister yes but uh don't worry we don't look like in each other  and she ' s much taller than me and uh  she got big eyes and mine uh small all laugh  and uh she is now studying in the us and  she had  yeah  just she has just gone at on uh i mean last august   and then just uh have finished the uh one term  oh   uhm uhm   uhm wow     oh   oh   oh   uhm uhm  uhm uhm just like me the time sequence just like me yeah we both uh take year one and but she ' s in us i ' m in hong kong but uh she ' s   uhm uhm  is she studying uh english also no i i think the system is just like kong u i mean uh in the first year she pick she pick the thing whenever she likes and then she has uh pick uh  now she ' s studying  it has a generation edu uh i mean general education and it ' s biology and it ' s  tough human biology  she has to she told me that she had to memorize uh above uh two hundred names of the human bones and out of it  uh   uhm uhm     uhm uhm   oh i see     general education   uhm uhm   oh     uhm   wah     oh   i think she has good memory   yeah yeah  uh she uh forced to  $b and $z laugh    anyway if you are interested it ' s easy then  yeah and she ' s study also uh usa history and she has she has to memorize all the  uhm usa     aiya so difficult to memorize history  yeah yeah yeah no you mean   is it    yeah  the president ' s name     yeah all  yeah yeah it ' s difficult   all the almost all of the presidents '   name and his and his policy  and why uh one argue with another and what happen to their policy  are they have conflicts somewhat like that    and it ' s the very very tough subject that she has took besides uh last    yeah   laughs it ' s terrible     yeah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm     aiya   yeah  general general   yeah yeah yeah and   do the students uh study uh usa politics uh  at usa history uh will become politicians or something  some professions in the uhm government   oh i think if she uhm uhm in uhm uhm uhm     yeah   uhm uhm uhm i think if she takes if she take it uh take the i mean the   his usa history when she ' s having a major   i think it will become a politician somewhat like that but i don't think she ' s that type of person all laugh  yes she can't bear the bore  she can't i mean uh she she is the type of girl that uh  long longs for fun and she have to have funs very active and somewhat like that and she also told me that she uh she took the tut
