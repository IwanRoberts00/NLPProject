 uhm i was uhm i ' ve i ' ve been really my whole career has
been teaching and uhm in nineteen ninety two 
my husband was offered an appointment at hong kong u and
he said to me how about this we go to hong kong
you don't have to work anymore 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 oh 
you agree you agreed to come to hong kong
 
just to accompany him and to have a good time 
but at that time have you find a job in hong kong 
and make a decision to come with him
 
when when you look at the hong kong salary in 
australia it looks wonderful 
 uhm 
wonderful
 
wonderful i ' m not uh uh uh hong kong university 
 salary
 it looks wonderful 
but very quickly 
$a-laughs 
i discover that to be a lady of leisure that
means to live at home in hong kong i need some
money 
oh the kind of salary that my husband ' s name is ian 
the kind of salary that he has is fine 
but we have three children 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 is fine 
oh you have three children
 
all needing schooling and university and accommodation and had all
kinds of things
and so actually it wasn't so much money 
$a-laughs 
not enough for me to do whatever i wanted so i did the
next best thing which is uh teaching 
 uhm 
 oh

 they ' re still young
they are still young 
uhm they are studying in hong kong or uh in the foreign country
uh in uh australia

kong
 
just now one son has returned to
 work here 
 uhm 
 uh 
oh she uh he also like to work in hong kong
 
there ' s more unemployment in australia than in hong kong 
uhm uhm 
uhm there is employment problem
uhm the unemployment rate is i think the unemployment rate in
australia is higher than hong kong
but at that at the at the recent time the employment
situation is not as good in the past years in hong kong
there are many people unemployed now so i am
worried about myself after my graduation whether i can find a job 
 which is suitable for me
 
 uhm uhm
uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm my son he has doesn't have a really doesn't have a
qualification and he he ' s working as a waiter in a

places which i don't know where else 
 
this one has just got its legal license last week 
it ' s only had a uh alcohol a liquor license only one week
 uhm 
 oh a chain restaurant 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm </[6 
oh
 
uhm so it ' s new 
uhm have you visited his restaurant
 
 yes 
 yeah 
$a-laughs 
absolutely i think you will do so
 
 last night last night i went and have dinner

$a-laughs 
uhm uh does uh did he serve you or did he uh
 sit with you
 
 yes yes 
no he can't sit with me he was on duty 
 he can't oh 
oh he ' s in on duty
oh it seems very interesting 
$a-laughs 
uhm i uhm uh will you will you stay in hong kong in
the future years
 
i really hope to stay 
uhm uh do you like hong kong
 
i love hong kong 
you love hong kong
i can't imagine a foreigner will said that hon 
she uh they say like hong kong two words 
 
 i think you ' d met a lot of
foreigners who said that 
 uhm 
uh why don't why why did you say that uh you like love
hong kong
 
because my well i ' m an old lady not so 
$a-laughs but i ' m old
well let ' s say old enough so i have had everything i
need 
i have had a peaceful time to bring up my children 
 
i ' ve had quiet
i live in the city
i live in the city with no industry no pollution 
 which is canberra and it ' s quite boring 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
boring
 
boring in australia 
i don't think so
 
very boring for me 
 i really enjoy the peaceful life in the
countryside uh with a house many trees many hill
i really like this kind of 
 
 you ' re just dreaming 
if you try canberra for a year you ' ll die 
$a-laughs of boredom 
is it
no there are many things you can do
for example you can cut the grass you can uh prepare many
food for children for husband go to uh the supermarket
the supermarket in the foreign country are very big
you can go around for a few hours so the time can pass 
pass on very quickly
 
you think for an intelligent qualified woman 
$a-laughs making lunch for her husband and children and going to the
supermarket is exciting venus
really 
at the at at at at the present time i
think it is interesting laughed but uh i de i don't
really know after a few years when i grow have grown up be a mature lady
 uh what whether it is still interesting or uh any more
 
 how long 
imagine it imagine it for twenty years like
some housewives 
imagine 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
i think i will enjoy the life
but i i ' m worry about at the present time whether a man can
 uh whether there is a man will marry with me 
$a-laughs 
 
uh uh i think your chances are good 
$z-laughs 
 no because the uh in hong kong there are so
many beautiful ladies and the men they choose their their
girlfriend with very high qualification
high needs not high wants about the girls
they they need a tru uh girl beautiful uh slim
 uh lady uhm they they pu they put more emphasize on the 
uh on the appearance of the girl so i think i have little little
chance 
$a-laughs 
 
i think you have everything actually 
 
$a-laughs 
be so at the present time i will uh make up my mind to
keep fit keep fit keep fit 
to to uhm it can uh bring uh to to keep fit can be
beneficial to find a job because when you find a job you will
employ a person with uh good looking uh don't uh fat and it seem that
 it is not uh so mobile in physically so i think it is very
important for for occupation and also for marriage
 
for everything for your work and for 
it also affects the way you you you life
if you are fit your chance is quite well
known
your chance of optimistic one-word
 is quite high so you need it for everything
 and you have everything
you ' ve got good looks you ' re smart 
$a-laughs you ' re slim and i would if don't worry
about a man
 don't even need one 
 for health 
 uhm 
 uhm i agree with you 
 uhm 
 oh 
 i i really worry about it
uh you don't know 
$a-laughs and then both laugh 
 
this is first time i hear this about hong because the
students of course don't tell me these interesting things 
actually we will not talk about this in the lesson you
know
there are many people
they will smile
they will laugh at me and i will not talk about this but
 in at this moment i can tell you this about
 
 uhm 
right it ' s quite privileged to hear some uh of course i
don't believe you because you ' re so you look so tut uh
we say spunky
you know it means you ' ve got energy and you ' re
intelligent so i don't believe somebody won't snatch you up 
 if you want a man
they are not so important 
 
$a-laughs 
you are a working woman 
yes it uhm do you think uh you value uh occupation 
in a very high important position for your whole life
 
do i have what 
uh do you vary your occupation uh very important
 for your whole life
 
do you do you mean do i worry 
no var vary vary 
that means uh do you think occupation is very important uh
is a important part in the whole life or or family life or uh
marriage
which one do you va value
 put a higher value for the 
 
 put a higher value value 
i didn't catch you one-word then
 value 
 uhm i ' m sorry 
 
uhm well in in my way i ' m the wrong generation 
you know i because my choices are so long ago
i made my choices so long ago but already
then i ' ve valued the idea that i could be independent 
 so i graduated and could i knew i could have a job 
 and always support myself 
and now my opinion is that in a marriage if you have worked
 you understand the pressure that a man uh
experiences 
if you worked in a demanding job it ' s important
and when you are handling when you have important
decisions with your children and i ' ve had very difficult
decisions because my children were difficult
my boys were difficult
it ' s very important somehow for some reasons it ' s important
to know you have your own place as a working like
as an operating person in the society so for me it ' s
being very important 
but unfortunately i don't my job isn't really i have
didn't work into a high status
i always uh help my husband study and
 have promotion and so on which uhm i wouldn't
 i don't know 
i don't know whether i would recommend it for my daughter 
 
i don't i think i should have struggled more for equality
 uhm 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm </[12 
 uhm 
uhm for me uh uh at the present time i ' ve i have same
ambition with you to be a independent uhm independent girl 
after my graduation i would like to find a job and also
 earn some money for a few years and go abroad to have a study
i really want to go abroad to study because i think that it
can give me many opportunities to to learn learn things
there are many things for me to learn uh i want to see what
are happening in the foreign country
i haven't been uh to this that uhm for example usa 
britain i have not been there before
i really hope to hope to go there and see what 
what are people doing uh and so on
i really hope to do so
 
 would you do you want to study or work 
or just uh experience 
uhm i have thought about before uh to find a job in
singapore and or or or maybe to uh to have further study in britain or
usa i have thought about before that
 
 uhm 
uhm one if the things that ' s interesting is that 
 when you visit a country it ' s very different
to living and working in the country
now if you come to hong kong you think oh
oh it ' s like this and you don don't find that anything the
tourists won't find that anything 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm do you have any adaption problem uh at at the
first time you you live in hong kong 
 
well i don't know whether you call them problems of
adaptation a lot of frustration 
a lot of frustration
 
yeah even today this morning perfect example
i have a uh gas heater not working in my kitchen 
uhm
 
so i want to tell somebody
and i had to ask three people before i could say in english
this is the hong kong gas company 
huge and then i say twenty-fifth floor and
they said twenty-three
i said no twenty-five
i can't even said fifth because it confuses
the number so i say twenty-five floor 
of course i ' m not being rude
i ' m just making sure they come to my place
 not somewhere else 
so uhm s some little difficulties like for the
housewife there are uh difficulties of not
finding thing
you just have to uh tut do it differently 
 so that 
and for work the adaptation is uh just uhm an 
exper 
it ' s very interesting
the students are very different but the 
adaptation problem is just finding something else like you saying today
 in a bit difficult to find their husband or just the way
students would accept that fitting in with hong kong ' s way is
very enjoyable 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
enjoyable
 
that part just finding out that it is different and then 
how is it different
that ' s interesting 
but dealing with people when i want to get a telephone
message that ' s very boring 
just trying to be patient or going to a shop and not
being able to buy something very very simple that was my big problem 
when i came here 
 uhm 
 uhm 
why
because i think uh in hong kong uh man many
people can speak english
 
not in the little
if you want to buy some paint or fix some furniture or fix
something in your house or your plugs don't work you have
to write it down in chin 
it ' s actually if it ' s all the clothes all the 
you think everything ' s in the big department store but
if it isn't there you ' re in real trouble 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 oh 
uhm do you have any chinese friends
 
yes 
yes
 
they help me
i say write this down for me 
$a-laughs please
i ' m going to the shop to buy some paint or lacquer or
something 
yeah i have to do this 
 uhm 
$a-laughs 
uhm uhm
how about one-word 
uh do you find any difficulty to to uh to get along
with uh chinese people
 
well i think i don't have any difficulty because
 uhm although i don't have a career 
i i think i don't have a career because i ' m a temporary english
instructor but i ' m passionate about language and about people
that ' s really my life 
so i think i ' ll get on with people and i love it 
 i mean 
i actually love trying to communicate so
 it ' s it ' s not for me it ' s that ' s where the interesting
life is so it ' s not i think it ' s alright for me 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 oh 
i think you are a ou outgoing person
do you
 
actually i ' m quite shy but because i ' m so 
interested in language i three words 
i said to my husband you know the fact that we came to hong
kong is just an unexpected bonus
you know bonus like you get a salary 
nobody said we would ever come to hong kong cos we we 
we just had ordinary jobs so it ' s a a a gift 
real bonus very interesting 
uhm so you want to several words
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uh how do you think about chinese people because 
in my in my opinion chinese people uh to some extent are se 
quite selfish and also they they they in some times will be
inconsiderate of other people 
for for example uhm you can see there are many rubbish
in uh on the pavement and uh when you go to the countryside and
to have a bbq barbecue you you will find the whole place is
covered with rubbish so i think sometimes chinese people are are
selfish rather uh compared with foreign people
 
well it ' s a little bit sweeping to say foreign people
are tidy careful of the environment chinese people aren't 
but yes i definitely notice that and i
definitely i could say to you i hate it
 i hate it or throwing things down 
but everyone no americans australians english 
everyone probably does it a bit too but when i went
for a walk two words around the reservoir uh 
near the peak and there was no litter not nothing drop 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 i hate it 
 uhm 
 really 
because this is a tou a a place for the tourist to come
 
and i said to my husband yesterday and i said isn't it
 beautiful 
$a laughed 
no plastic bags because we walk along from queen mary
along the peak there to the university and there is
litter and there is no we think there ' s no reason for this it ' s a
beautiful walk and there is rubbish
yes so i had i for me yes i i notice it and i don't
like it 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm but uh one uh for chinese people i like their 
some characteristic
for example they are quite they quite respect their
origins of a country
for example i ' m a chinese people uhm we will uh
we will give our concern to the chinese people in all over the world
in other country for example in china and in other countries
for example in the recent time there is a a earthquake
there was a earthquake in china
many uh in the tv program they they they they
say that they ask people to donate uh the blankets the clothes for
 for the people who suffered in the china
many people do so
they they are so generous to give out their money 
their their food to those people so it is a kind of good
behaviour of the chinese people i think
 
yes very noticeable when in my first year here one of
the uh english instructors not chinese 
 an english woman was sick in hospital and all
the staff chinese staff very much so raise money
we raise money and this person got almost a month ' s salary
 uh which was the first time i ' ve seen this
 because well in australia we all have 
sick pay worker ' s compensation so we have we have money still
comes in even if we are sick 
but here if you ' re if you are not in
in many jobs when you are sick money stops
 and so there is a very i was stunned actually amazed of the
generosity of people who only knew this person very
little contributing what must have i don't know
how much people contributed but the total was very impressive 
 and people have done that three times now 
for three different people 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 there is not no sick pay 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 three times 
the pe uhm don't uhm the the the staff is
suffered from very big disease
 
one person had a back problem and didn't come back to work
 she was hospitalized and had a operation 
 
and in the case of another one one of our colleagues actually
died of cancer 
yeah he very young
thirty four thirty three or four 
so the first time we raise money when she was sick 
and stopped work and then we raise a little bit of money
because she has two children 
and but she died last year
she died very quickly 
six months 
 oh 
 uhm 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
oh did sh did did she has children have children
or
 
yes two children very young 
 oh 
oh so in uh i think in for uh for my life i i
really afraid of a of death of my relatives my friends
i really afraid to see this moment in the future
i i really i i i think i cannot stand with this
kind of frustration and unhappiness
 
but we have not we just lucky in health or not lucky
how could 
you have to stand it if it ' s in your family 
uhm i ' m afraid of this actually
 
 no 
then think about it 
yes yes yes i i think
 
stay fit 
uhm so uhm i have a dream uh in the future
i can make money uh buy a big house uh to invite
all my relatives and we live together
 wah it is a perfect life for my
life 
it is my future dream but i think can it be fulfilled in
 
 uhm uhm 
will you do that in hong kong or china
this big house where will it be 
in hong kong in hong kong uhm in a countryside
 wah it is so comfortable but it is
not so practical i think
uh you to live in hong kong it is uh if you work there ' re
many things to do
you have to uh not only the job but you have to how to
deal with the relationship with your colleagues your boss your client
oh there are many things which can which can frustrate
your frustrate you to to have ful to fulfill your
dream
 
uhm uhm 
because uh my brother said that you have to try to go out
to work to see what are the difficulties they face
many many things
i really don't sometime i really don't know how to deal
with people because pe uhm i think uh in the outside world
 especially in the working world people are quite they have the
conflict interest conflict between each other because they all want to be
promoted to the upper position in the organization so i think uh
it is quite difficult to find a friends af after when i go out to
work 
do you do you think so
 
well i don't know because this is
something i really don't know because hong kong is very different
 
and one thing i do say is uh well first of all i could
never compete in hong kong in the business world 
becau for the reason you say 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
oh you agree
 
i think there is some there is competition 
 and it ' s very different to anything i am good at 
and my husband is also in the university job 
 so i ' m very very glad for this because the unknown 
stress and conflict and drive for promotion unknown for
us to uh i mean what we can analyze 
i think for a westerner one word 
have to have a very special skill or 
i don't know what you need but i don't have it
 and i don't think my husband has it 
and i think you ' re ri 
i think you are quite correct and clever well intelligent to keep
in mind that it is like that and maybe a big firm
will train you or if your brother already works uh or you make some
friends who are willing to uhm discuss things with you
i think you need something but i think you
it ' s pretty good pretty important that you should be 
chinese to start with 
i i ' m not saying this out because from prejudice i
just think that the business world in hong kong just thinking
i think it ' s tough
i think it ' s competitive and i don't think i have what
it takes to be there or to be successful there
 i ' m sure i don't 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uh is it the reason for you to take up a job which is
uh uh uh of teaching
 
 uhm 
no not well no no no
uh in australia this would not that part
wasn't important 
 i ' ve just happened already to be a teacher 
 
you know but uhm i ' m just saying that my husband could
try consultancy in australia but i don't think well he might but he
wouldn't try business in hong kong 
but he i think he would try in aus he probably will try 
even he ' ll retire and then because he will be very qualified when we go
home 
but in hong kong he could he could only operate as an
established person at the university not as a business person 
 because the the unwritten law unwritten uh dynamics uh
 you know beyond us i think 
uhm but there ' re not be you will learn them because
you you are born to learn them 
 uhm 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
i i don't really i don't really know whether i can
cope with these difficulties in the future because i for me i ' m
a sh a a person with with bad temper
uh i will usually uh at at home i will if i find something
which is not uh uhm good for me i will i will quarrel with my 
my my brother sister 
so it i think the character of me uh of bad temper is
not suit uhm is not good for me to go out to work
 
well i don't belie i truly believe that you will
find whatever you need for work 
you might be bad-tempered at home but i don't think this will
i really don't uh because you are intelligent so you
can separate the need to have show your bad temper and the need not
to show your bad temper at work 
 uhm 
i told you uh uh uh my experience
uhm i have said before
uh i take up a part time job uh last month
uhm uh in the last month my boss my uh i i ' m belong i ' m
supervised for by a woman and uhm and the woman is supervised by
my boss
uhm my boss told her that uhm i because uh uh my task
is to to for to input the data of the uh resume of the applicants
 so
