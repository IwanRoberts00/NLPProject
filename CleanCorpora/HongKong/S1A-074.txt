uh you should get a roommate and uh the school will give you the uh
 will give you the meal
and also uh will give you all the necessary things that you should
have

by the way at that i don't know
everything i don't know
i don't know where ' s minden or where ' s bell just 
 by chance
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
right laughs 
and then
they said they said that uhm you it ' s very hard to find you a
dorm now because it ' s quite late because that ' s that ' s the last day of

of friends lots of people here is very nice tut 
uh after that uhm i don't know where to go for my class
 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
uh you don't know where to go 
yeah 
 and
 laugh 
i don't know
actually i don't know where is the tut uh where where is
the university because i can't find any tut anythings
else that write johnson and wales university or any campus
 
 uhm uhm 
right
cos we ' re up on the east side
 and everything ' s downtown 
 yeah 
yeah
because all my because i ' m studying business and 
 all the building is in downtown and
don't have any campus in downtown 
so i ask international affairs where is where where is my class
and he ' s and she said that is something here on the map
 
and i just look for it for a very long time
i don't know 
 and
 laugh where is it
okay then finally i find it
it ' s very lucky that
but uhm i ' m studying esl now because uhm they said that uh i
don't get enough toefl score
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
you what 
i don't have
i don't got enough toefl score
you know toefl
 
toefl 
yeah
no
it ' s uhm 
that is uh uh 
that ' s th the full name is uhm t 
i don't know that
that ' s uhm
that ' s an officials official uh test for the
uhm for the international student to test their
english standards 
uhm that ' s all over the world
they you can you can take the test all over the world
 and you can 
yeah
 and also you can take this here
and they said i don't have got enough enough mark
and i go to the esl and then 
after a placement test 
they said that i i can go to an extra english course and get four
point five credit for that course
 
 uhm uhm 
 oh okay 
 uhm uhm 
 really 
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
yeah 
but they said that i ' m a little bit late 
 and
 laugh that the class is full
 
oh no 
no
and and tut i just get
i just get six credits in this trimester
 
yeah 
and i think it ' s very little is it
 
you have six classes 
no
just uh four class
 
oh four classes 
 but six credits
 
uh okay
 for you 
you got six credits for four classes 
 two words 
yeah
 
that is 
uhm
 
that ' s a year 
 laughs 
i know i also i also should go to class on friday
 
why do you only get six credits 
i don't know but they they seem the four they
see the four classes as one class just studying english
they seem they they they just thinks that is an esl class and
got four periods from eight to twelve twe twelve twenty-five
 
 the which classes 
what classes do you take 
uhm
they said that that ' s the uhm esl class
that should uhm the first class is listening
the second uh the second class is grammar
and the third class is writing and the fourth class is the 
uh reading 
 
 oh
so you don't have 
like english english class
like english comp 
 oh i get it 
 yeah 
 tut so i don't
uh but at first i i don't know i should take that kind of course
here because uhm by my toefl score uh i can get into
regular class for uh for another university
 
 uhm uhm 
oh really 
yeah
 
you just can't here 
yeah 
i don't need to i don't need to study esl in in 
other university
no
but in here i should i should study that
but i don't know that because in hong kong they didn't mention it
they didn't
the agency don't tell me that uh you need to 
maybe no uh that was uh
the agency is
the application form is through aesl
 it ' s an another agency for about uh fifteen
universities in united states
 
 oh 
 no 
 uhm uhm 
yeah 
and then my first choice is not this school
the other school
i don't know i don't
i can't remember remember it ' s my second choice or third choice
but after all they give me the i twenty 
you know what ' s i twenty 
 
 what ' s that 
no 
that ' s the uhm the official document 
 for applying the student visa to united states
because it ' s it ' s very difficult in united states if you are
not if you ' re not if you are not a us citizen 
so uhm they just then they just mail me i twenty
i don't know which school is it
and after that they said that you should take an english course in
this university
uh but it ' s very difficult to to send back the i twenty and mail
another one again 
so okay
i accept
i accept it
it doesn't i think it doesn't matter but
after i arrive here i don't know that just 
just got six credits for
but my tuition fee is uhm is almost about
five thousand dollars
 
 okay 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 that one word 
oh you only pay five thousand 
yeah
 
for tuition and room and board 
yeah
 
oh wa 
that ' s not bad 
that ' s not bad
but it ' s the same as you is it
 
no 
no
 
no
i pay like sixteen thousand 
sixteen thous for whole year
 
uhm uhm 
but i just mean for a trimester one trimester 
 
 oh
for all for one tri 
for one tri 
 
 yeah 
probably the same 
 probably the same tut 
but i just got six credits and 
 laughs 
 
 uhm 
i don't think you need those courses at all
you seem fine 
 laughs one-word 
really
 
you seem like you understand 
but they said that i should 
 laughs
