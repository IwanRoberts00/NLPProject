 uhm uhm 
uh huh yeah 
 you sometimes you really can't get ev 
everything anything else
that ' s the problem
 
uhm uhm a long pause and interruptions

 england trying to uhm practice his ballet dancing
 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm 
yah that ' s how i heard it
haven't watched it
 
oh okay 
so let ' s see how its goes but every everybody who who have
uhm whose has watched it uh recommend it
 
uhm 
so i guess it ' s pretty good
 
okay uhm
sounds interesting 
uh huh
 
uhm uhm
so have you have you have you thought of going travelling anytime
soon 
no no not really
 
 uhm 
but where do you want to go 
where
 
yeah you have time 
 anywhere anyway 
it ' s just about it ' s just a a problem of uhm money and time
 
okay 
uhm uhm
 
but there must been there must have been a a a favourite spot
that you want to go
a place that you really want to go 
anyone an anyplace
 
anyplace 
anyplace yes absolutely i ' ll go
 
uhm
so do you go to shenzhen a lot 
 h how do i sorry
 
no do you go to shenzhen 
shenzhen no i ' m not really interested in that
i have been there once
 
oh 
that ' s all
because uh lately i heard that it ' s really dangerous to go
 
oh is that 
yah i heard it 
 
 uhm 
okay because i have 
 if you go make sure somebody goes with you
 
oh because i have never been there uhm 
uhm uhm
 
i was thought i was thinking about going there 
yeah
 
and macau
have you been there 
macau
 
yup 
uhm yeah long time ago long time ago
yeah i would like to go there
 
how ' s the place like macau 
uhm pretty original i think
 really uhm what uhm because it ' s been a a colony
 
 uhm 
uhm 
to portugal so a lot of uhm uh what what will they call
portuguese-elated buildings and culture
 
oh okay 
yeah a nice place to visit
 
 uhm 
 once in while
it ' s not that exciting
 
oh it ' s not that exciting 
 but uhm it ' s uhm a tourist spot uh
 
uhm okay uhm tut yah because i think i meant
 to go to macau tut before i i leave for australia 
 singapore 
uh huh oh
 
uhm 
when when are you leaving exactly
 
around mid may 
mid may a long pause, interruptions 
 
probably i could uh leave as soon as i finish all my assignments
uhm uhm
 
so i guess it ' s about mid may 
oh
 
uhm the earliest i think
earliest is mid may 
 uhm 
 that ' s pretty good 
 
 what about you 
that ' s good
 
do you have any exams 
no
 
oh what have what have you been taking 
uhm
 
what course are you taking at the moment
creative writing and 
uhm asian american lit america studies
 
uhm uhm 
uhm italian culture and jane austen
 
oh oh jane austen 
uhm uhm
 
are you required to read any of of her novels 
yah sense and sensibility and pride and prejudices
 
oh how do you find them 
 writing 
huh
 
how do you find them 
very interesting
 
uhm which one do you like 
uhm i ' m still working on pride and prejudices so i don't
know but so far it ' s it ' s really interesting and i absolutely adore sense
and sensibility
 
uh have you finished sense and sensibility 
yah
 
how do you find it 
 ve i love it
 
uhm
 is it is it the same as is it is it quite close to
what uh lee ang did on the movie 
 very very basic element 
well you can say so but uhm he he makes it more modern
 
uhm 
in in a way
and of course that didn't well the the main theme is uhm basically
the same but he cut out a lot details
cos if everything details should be you know taken into the
movie it would be a really long movie
 
uhm 
but it ' s still good
 
so you just don't 
 and and and i love the movie as well
 
 uh 
 i ' ve watched it for a couple of times
 
me too
i too like the movie
i like the way the he handles the the characters and the way he
presents the the period 
uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
i know i know he deserve be best act
 uh best director
 uhm uhm 
uhm so you have you only have two two novels to do 
uhm in one semester yeah
 
uhm 
a very very condense way
 
uhm okay
you have no exams 
no luckily 
 
 oh it ' s nice 
oh okay 
but i ' ll i ' ll i ' m i will go the same way with you
because uhm you don't have exam either
 
 uhm

 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm 
yes three words 
 
 what kind of job are you looking at 
i want to actually i want to do something related to design
but i need to well- equipped myself first because i just started uh learning
fresh one word and some softwares like that
and i think i need to find a stable job first and then study a
part-time degree or part-time diploma in design field
i i ' d like to tut devote all of my time in desi 
design because uh i i ' ll i think my first job will relate to something like
marketing
 
 uhm 
uhm 
uhm management uhm management trainee or but i don't like
this type of this kind of work actually
 do you participate in any of the h uh lee hall activities

uhm tut uh in year one i i just because i studied
japanese in year one and then i very busy and de very demanding
i need to study many credits so i just focus on uh some activities

social function is a function that
 
uhm uhm 
uh there ' s a committee that organise some activities always
in the week and then uh some hallmates will join the functions just like uh
playing games and and yes uh hanging around and then and then may be have

and then we ' re selling tickets to outsiders
 
uhm 
and earn money actually earn money for the hall
 
oh okay
