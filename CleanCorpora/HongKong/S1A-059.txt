 uhm   tut 
""
it  ' s the first time i  ' ve seen  public bathrooms in in

paper    uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
  pub   
""
 uhm  
""
public
 
""
i mean the the bathrooms in in the   restaurants 
like mcdonald and that    
""
they are usually if if i really need  these  the bathrooms
in china
""
i will go to mcdonald  or  somewhere
""
because they  ' re usually a little better    
""
but uhm  tut  uh so i went to xiamen and then uhm 
quanzhou  which is     it  ' s just a little farther up
the coast 
""
""
 bathroom  
""
 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
  quan quan   
""
oh i see
 
""
yeah uh not not that special
""
but nearby is a city called the  chouwu  which is uhm 
tut  a  forecast  city
""
that was built in the ming dynasty
""
that  ' s   along  the ocean and the walls are still in
taps so it  ' s very   beautiful  
""
""
 oh  
""
 oh  
""
i don't know all the   cities  you were visited
 
""
 uhm  
""
uh i just i have a book that that tells me   where to go
 
""
""
 i  i don't   think i will go there
""
because i always think that those cities are very uhm  poor
""
are are they poor or the   infrastructures  are not
good and and the  and   the transportation uh and the hygiene are
 one-word  
""
xiamen
 
""
 uh  
""
 you would you would like xiamen
""
xiamen is very nice  
""
xiamen  ' s   very  clean
""
the other places they  ' re very  one-word  
 laughs     
""
they are not ideal 
 laughs 
""
i went to fuzhou which is a very dismal depressing looking city
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
how are the people there
 
""
uh people are friendly
""
and and and i think they are they are fairly used to seeing
foreigners so i didn't 
""
people didn't notice me as much    more   
""
""
 i but   i know that uhm many of the people in the
xiamen or or fujian
""
they  they do not speak mandarin or   they  they
speak uh fujian    one-word  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah and their   their mandarin is very difficult
to understand when they speak   it  
""
""
 but   uh can they understand you
 
""
if if if they want money from me they can understand me
""
  that  ' s  usually how things work in the world
""
if i if i  ' m trying to buy a ticket or something 
one-word 
""
and people can find a way to understand that
""
  uh  i i didn't uh  i didn't take any trains and
that  ' s usually what i talk to people the most
""
so i i uh  uh i i didn't really have long conversation 
 
""
and  then i went to  wuyishan  uh the  na  a
nature reserve in in northern    uh  fujian 
""
oh that was great suffer again
""
and we take a night bus 
""
""
 oh  
""
 so  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
night bus
 
""
yeah another   night bus right 
""
in all they only have one a day at least at five thirty 
""
and we were very
""
at five thirty at night and we were very angry
""
because that means it arrives at three in the morning  
 
""
they won't leave later we said it should leave at eight thirty or
nine thirty
""
  you better arrive at five or six  
""
""
 uhm at what time  
""
 uh  
""
 you follow  uh you join some tour   local 
 tour  there
 
""
 no  
""
no i just went by myself
""
there there are buses   uh  
""
""
 oh   are are the people go there also tourists
from  hong kong other places or just   their  local residents
there
 
""
 yeah  
""
no no no there were tour groups from different places   
""
""
i guess there is a it  ' s the the the full of
""
there are a lot of people fly from shanghai that that  ' s fairly
close by by plane
""
uh it  ' s hard to get there if you don't fly now i know though
""
""
""
 oh  
""
are there many foreigners there like you so
""
do they feel   surprise to 
 
""
 not not not that   area that that area they were a
little surprised you know 
""
""
and they are also surprise at your fluent mandarin  
 one-word  
 
""
 no   no not fluent but they were surprised that i
could speak to them yeah    
""
the uhm  tut   in that area they were very aggressive
to other if the
""
the only thing in the city is tourism
""
so anywhere you go they are always following you and 
one-word    the  
""
""
 uh  
""
 is the   are are the are the things there very
cheap
 
""
no 
""
""
not cheap why
 
""
well i mean 
""
""
because it is near to shanghai
 
""
uh no that  is  that really near shanghai   by
 aeroplane
""
it it it  ' s it  ' s a decent there are a lot of flight to shanghai
   
""
but i mean things like eating are inexpensive
""
but  like at  wuyishan  every scenic spots you to go is
another ticket
""
  that  ' s maybe  thirty renmenbi here and twenty
there and  they keep trying to add it on and
""
and they purposely don't have public buses that go to those
places
""
so you have to take taxi   so  yeah
""
it may be better to go   with a tour group  
""
""
 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
 oh i see  
""
 oh  
""
 what what   what  ' s special uh  si   beau
 beautiful scenic spots are there
 
""
uh it it  ' s  it  ' s it  ' s a lot of mountains where they just
have very very steep edges where they just look like a straight wall 
  
""
and   some have  some have waterfalls that fall down
and 
""
""
 uh  
""
 but they  
""
but they don't allow tourists to climb or   walk on 
 
""
 no   you couldn't because   some of them are
just very straight yeah yeah  
""
""
 are you
""
you can only see you can only   see have a look at  
 uh 
 
""
 yeah   and they grow a lot of varieties of tea there
""
they are supposed   to be  good
""
i i i  ' m   not  i  ' m not a tea expert   but
they did  
""
""
 uh  
""
 you  
""
 oh
""
did you   buy any
""
  no 
 
""
 i   buy bought a little bit of tea yeah
""
  the  the  three words  that  ' s
that  ' s   what people say so 
""
yeah i don't  i don't know either
""
but they insisted that and they show me where they grow some of
that so  yeah 
""
""
 oh  
""
 i i don't know  
""
but i i think uhm they probably charge more for a foreigner  es
 uh   especially  for foreigner
 
""
 oh yeah  
""
oh no i  ' m aware of that but there  ' s nothing i can do   so
 
""
""
 did   not uh did you bargain  bargain to them
 
""
oh yeah   yeah  
""
""
 i   think you can actually in any places in china
you can bargain uhm  more than fifty percent discount
 
""
yeah it it it  ' s starting to change  uh at at places they
""
i guess people get kind of tired of bargaining
""
sometimes like  hotels they  ' ll publish a price list
""
they will publish a discounting list   and  they
they don't
""
they really unwilling to go below the discount list so they
""
you can still sort of bargain but it  ' s it  ' s it  ' s not
""
it depends on where you go    
""
some places everything you have to bargain
""
some it  ' s  it  ' s uh it  ' s more straight now
""
like grocery stores often don't bargain any more  you know
""
 aft  after that i went into jiangxi province  which
they don't see any foreigners
""
no one goes there 
""
""
 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
jiangxi   okay 
""
where is it
 
""
 yeah  
""
that  ' s uh   just the west of fujian
""
it  ' s just straight  west
""
i went in from the north side down it
""
a two hour bus ride that took four hours 
""
because   they  stop any time even they see a cow on
the road
""
they ask if it wants to ride   
""
and they  they packed the   people there 
""
and not the traffic and there  ' s a lot of construction  
 
""
and it was a widening road on the mounts
""
three people threw up on the ride
""
they were uhm  drawing  up outside the window  
and road side 
""
that was  terri  
 laughs  
""
and eventually i got to uh jingdezhen   which  is
the uhm  tut  the main pottery center in china   
one-word   
""
""
  two-words  west all the west oh yes
 
""
 why  
""
 oh the traffic  
""
 very crowd  
""
 oh  
""
 oh  
""
 uhm  
""
 property    cen 
 
""
pottery where they make   uh  uh potter
""
and they   make  dishes that    in 
in the uhm  tut 
""
it it first become uh uh  a big pottery center in the southern
song dynasty    about  eleven eleven hundreds
""
and to this day the main pottery center in china
""
  and  that was interesting but there  ' re
""
just the stores have a lot of junk
""
  there  are few stores that have very nice stuff
and the rest was just junk 
""
""
 oh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 oh  
""
 uh  
""
it seems uhm there are so many historical buildings or 
historical buildings there
""
but uh i i want to know  whether there are modern building like
big shopping malls in hong kong   or 
 
""
 uh    there almost uhm uh jiangxi is very very
  undeveloped 
""
it it  ' s very rural     uh fujian like xiamen
  fuzhou is  
""
""
 oh  
""
 uh  
""
 commercial center   is is   uh 
 
""
 yeah   some of the commercial centers had have more
shopping malls
""
but  maybe you know for every ten that hong kong had they
might have one 
 laughs 
""
yeah it it  ' s  usually not very nice
""
it it  ' s just the collection of independent stores  that are
 uhm of varying quality
""
usually you can judge the city base on  whether  they have
mcdonald or kfc yet
""
  it  ' s  usually only medium to larger cities have
those so that why how you can tell 
""
""
 oh  
""
 one-word  no mcdonalds there no   kfc
""
 
""
 but   none in jingdezhen yeah    
yeah
""
something like xiamen fuzhou there  ' s many everywhere but 
   they  ' re  one-word  
""
""
 oh  
""
 uh  
""

hours 
""
and i have that have a hard seat  yingzuo 
""

""
the  tram    was  
""
""

""
 oh   i see
""
  yingzuo uh hard hard seat 
 
""

too expensive so i   sat  on a chair 
""
""
 uh  
""
and  one-word  is that air condition and
""
  no  
 laughs 
 
""
 no  
""
no so hot
""
uhm but there  ' re nice people next to me
""
there were three three people that were studying to be police
officers  yeah 
""
""
i  re  i  re  i remember that when i was very
very small i also took the  took the hard seats   train 
 
""
 yeah  
""
it hasn't changed i  ' m sure is it 
""
""
but now  you know uhm there is some  very  comfor
 comfortable seat train from  hong kong direct to   gu 
guangzhou
""
but that was very expensive
 
""
no it  ' s it  ' s seventy renminbi 
""
""
no   
""
two two hundred hong kong 
 
""
 oh that was even more expensive one
""
oh i   don't know about that one   uhm  
""
""
 two   hundred hong kong   dollar  uh
""
""
how to say  uh the trains uh have two   deckers 
 
""
 oh  
""
oh i see
""
double-decker   uh uh uh  
""
""
 yeah yeah yeah   yeah
""
and that   was  very new    
""
i i   i went i went  to guangzhou last year  to do
the  pi  to do a pizza hut project
""
  we  all the group members also took the  took
took the train
""
and it costs me uh four hundred dollar
 
""
  one-word   
""
 uh  
""
 i can't afford that  
""
 uh  
""
oh 
 laughs  
""
""
so expensive
 
""
oh
""
was it was it a special experience
""
was it worth the money 
 uh yes i i i think it worth
""
i i went to the book city in china to buy some books   
""
this  one these   two  the database  
and computer  networks    
""
yeah that was uh  quite cheap     yeah
 
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh so  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
yes uh i i found that  any any trains going to shenzhen 
 or  any buses
""
they add a lot of money to go from guangzhou to shenzhen
""
like uh when i was taking a train from uh hengyang in wunan 
   to go out to take a sleeper to guangzhou
""
i i think it  ' s about one hundred fifty
""
but to take continue on two more hours to shenzhen was like two
hundred ninety
""
  they  added a lot just to  have those extra
hours
""
so i didn't do that  yeah 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
so uh did you did you buy any books because   it  ' s  it  ' s
""
you have said that  it is very expensive to buy books in  in
the us
 
""
 uhm  
""
i bought some here
""
in in china i i bought a few
""
this time i didn't buy any  but   uh you  
""
""
 where   did you go to buy books in in very  in
in  si  shopping malls like the book city or
 
""
yeah like uhm  tut  a lot of cities like shanghai uh have
a a foreign languages book store 
""
""
yes foreign   and guangzhou  also have
""
and   shenzhen  too
 
""
 and yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah yeah
""
sold that kind of stuff
""
and  usu  usually i  ' ll just 
""
usually they either have very old classics in english or they
have chinese translations that
""
  if  they are imported books then that you don't
really safe any money 
""
you know if it if it is just like a best seller in america that
they imported that will be expensive   but  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 oh  
""
actually i i i i want to know that uh the books are  pirated
copies or  two-words    or 
 
""
 oh   no that different   there will be there
will  be another   story  
""
""
 i i don't know that  
""
 no uh   the cover said that it is official  copy
version
 
""
so do the vcd when you buy them uh  all speakers laugh 
""
if they copy the whole book why not copy the thing that says it  ' s
official right
""
yeah 
""
but uh in china everybody justifies that
""
they say that they  ' re developing
""
  they  should be able to copy things and  not not
pay for copyright and 
""
""
 uh  
""
actually in hong kong the case is also the   same 
 
""
 uhm  
""
i think   it  ' s changed you know  
""
""
 i think in every places    in every place
people like to buy cheap things
 
""
uhm yeah
""
uh when when i was studying in japan
""
one of the professors talked about how  japanese used to feel
that way
""
  but  then japanese companies started making lots
of software and video games and   now they hate it 
""
yes because they they lose all those money in china now
""
before they had nothing to lose so they loved it but
""
so people think maybe china will change eventually when 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 they start to hate it  
""
no i i don't think   so 
""
i think uh the people who    hate it are  only the
businessmen   who  make the software but not the uh end user
 
""
 never  
""
 hundred of years  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah 
""
""
and
 
""
but if the businessmen give the policemen to enforce the laws
""
then there  ' re actually might might be some change 
""
""
uh
 
""
uhm  uhm 
""
  so what will  you do if you if you if your job 
after you graduate requires  you  trips to china 
""
""
  two-words   
""
i don't know i really don't know
 
""
are you going to insist on  all expense paid flights
everywhere
""
or you  ' re going to be able to take the trains  a long pause
 
""
""
i don't know
 
""
it it   it  ' s it it it  ' s difficult  it difficult
enough when i travel for fun
""
so i i don't know what it  ' ll be like for work
""
it then it really be terrible 
""
""
 i think that  ' s okay  
""
uhm  uhm
""
but maybe i  ' ll try if they give me give me such a chance
 
""
uhm
""
 one-word  if you just if you work in
""
if you have to go to like shenzhen and zhuhai xiamen
""
most are very nice and  and then pretty clean   and 
yeah 
""
""
 uhm  
""
how about beijing
""
have you been to   beijing 
 
""
 i  ' ve   been there  a a few years ago
""
i hear the weather gets is getting worse and worse uh the 
 sandstorms    yeah  
""
""
 yes  
""
 yeah   yeah yeah
""
i i read   the  newspaper   yesterday 
 
""
 so  
""
 i   the uh
""
i don't know how well i will be able to handle the pollution
""
 bei  beijing is very nice
""
it  ' s uh  it  ' s you have to like politics to be there
""
cause it   ev  everywhere you go there  ' s something you
know some government building
""
and it it you know like being in maybe washington d.c. in the us
where you  ' re just 
""
you sort of surrounded by the world of politics
""
  and  and that uhm i don't like quite as much
""
but uh not beijing is nice
""
some of it  very chinese and you know kind of preserved from
the qing dynasty
""
other parts are ugly russian buildings that they  build 
in the nineteen fifties and 
""
those things should be destroyed 
""
in the north i like dalian  and  the best 
""
""
 uhm  
""
  dalian 
 
""
 yeah  
""
qingdao is also good
""
  it  ' s  very clean 
""
""
 uh  
""
was it the  northwest part of china
 
""
northeast 
""
""
northeast
 
""
yeah they  ' re both on the coast 
""
""
uh i   see 
 
""
 yeah  
""
dalian  and there  ' s 
""
there there  ' s a lot of business from korea
""
they go across the water     near korea
""
and qingdao is uh south of beijing  one-word 
""
""
""
  two-words   
""
so uhm will you also go to the northwest part of the of china
because   it is uh 
 
""
 some day i would   like to 
""
""
it is under developing    two-words 
""
 
""
 that  ' s not even   that  ' s not developing
""
that  ' s uh that  ' s uh very bottom uh places like gansu and
ningxia that  ' s  uh
""
i would i would like to see that some day
""
but it takes a lot of time to go to those places 
""
""
yeah
 
""
you can't just  go for a week and back
""
i go to  uh guangxi uh you know that   would  take
 a lot of free time and  yeah
""
some day i would like to  yeah 
""
""
 uh  
""
uhm after you back to us and then you come to china again
 
""
uhm may maybe maybe i can  get myself a graduation present
next year and
""
and spend them up in china going  to   places 
like that 
""
that will be more difficult to communicate
""
cause a lot really don't speak any kind of chinese
""
a lot of uh   central  asian languages 
""
""
 oh  
""
 say  
""
central asian   language  wow
 
""
 yeah  
""
 one-word  languages and  you know some of
the muslim groups even speak arabic languages   uh  
""
""
 wow  
""
i i don't know what this uh
 
""
a lot of them are more russian than chinese so 
""
""
at the west and   and 
 
""
 the   northwest   though  
""
""
 the   northwest are  russian  are  
russians 
 
""
 well   i mean  the kind of russian muslim is is
all kind of mix
""
like the southern areas are russia like uhm asaibaijiang are are
 one-word 
""
there  ' s a lot of there  ' s a lot of uhm muslims and   tut
 uh sort of central asians
""
they  ' re not really russians   but  that group
""
but a lot of those are at the northwest of china   too
 
""
""
 uh  
""
 wow  
""
too complicated   
""
i don't i don't  i don't know any geography or  tut 
  or  one-word  
 
""
 oh it  ' s very good  one-word   
""
 oh that  ' s that  ' s why   like like xinjiang is a
is   autonomous  region    cause it  ' s  
""
""
 xin  
""
 oh  
""
xinjiang is also uh is also in the west uh northwest
 
""
uhm the far northwest 
""
""
oh
 
""
north of tibet 
""
""
is it very cold and also very  hot
 
""
from what i hear yes
""
there  ' s lots of desert and it  ' s   yeah  
""
""
 oh  
""
terrible
 
""
yeah it  ' s 
""
there is a reason
""
it it it  ' s near the end of earth basically it  ' s uh it  ' s 
""
""
i but i think the  the  the pollution problem there is
 is not serious right
 
""
it shouldn't be
""
there  ' s nothing there   i think 
""
and uhm i think in the gansu province the the capital there
lanzhou is the most polluted city in china    than  otherwise
""
yeah they in the china daily they publish weekly pollution the
weekly pollution index    where  they have a ranking of what  ' s
most polluted
""
i don't know how the scale works
""
but  let  ' s say in the winter time like beijing shang
""
beijing may be a hundred and fifty and i  ' m not sure what that
really means
""
but then   shanghai  like one twenty
""
  other  cities are eighty ninety one hundred
""
but this lanzhou   is usually three fifty  
""
""
 oh  
""
 wow  
""
 uh  
""
 oh  
""
 uh  
""
 i think that that  ' s  
""
i think that  ' s     the average
""
i think that scale is similar to hong kong
 
""
 wow  
""
is it
""
yeah i i don't   understand how works but  
""
""
 but i i think the
""
i    re  i remember that the most serious 
polluted day in hong kong  rec  records are scale of uh  two
hundred    
""
two hundred in causeway bay or   hong kong 
 
""
 uh  
""
 uh okay yeah   so this lanzhou is about three
fifty
""
  because  it it  ' s a city right in between
mountains   uh 
""
and there  ' s lots of factories so that pollution doesn't get out
""
once you get out of the city  it  ' s okay
""
but in the city it  ' s just like a a trap from the 
""
""
 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
so i think the people there maybe
""
when they go out they all wear the mask
 
""
wear masks
""
  yeah  
""
""
 put   on their mask
 
""
i i i read an article recently of a   man  who uhm
 tut  i forget his name
""
he made he made millions  in uh in other parts of china in in
some kind of business
""
and he returned to his hometown in lanzhou    
""
and he  ' s doing some project where  there are
""
he  ' s trying to destroy the mountains  around the city
""
and it  ' s  it  ' s something where they run water continuously
down the mountain to soften the the earth
""
  and  then they can move it away
""
so they are trying to knock part of the mountain down
""
so more air can come in and circulate 
""
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
i see
""
oh uh up to now  tut  i understand your trip more  
and 
""
i i i know  i know i i hope i know china more and i hope i will
 tut  know china more
 
""
 uh  
""

 one-word   
""
""

""

""
""

""

""

""

""
  i  ' m just 
 
""
 she was like   a boy 
""
""
  yes  she she just like a a guy   
""
""
but uh but just a  little boy
""
because she is thin and she is short

""
uhm   they think 
""
""
 does she   have many money  men   
 mon    mon    no 
""
""

""
 no   no
""
i   think uh 
 
""
 there  ' s something   people hong kong question here
""
does she have lots of money
""
oh of course that  ' s why she  ' s so popular   
one-word   
""
""
 i  ' ve told   you hong kong people are realistic
 
""
we no
""
that  ' s materialistic not realistic 
""
""
  yeah uhm 
""
""
 maybe   practical
""
""
yeah yeah
 
""
oh uh 
""
""
  practical 
""
""
 practical  
 
""
no materialistic is not  
 and
 laugh  or it means practical 
""
""
and the the girls are said that  her personality is good
 
""
uh ha   
""
she   go  to hong kong u 
""
""
 uh ha  
""
""
  no 
""
""
 no   no
""
she is in canada
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 uh   okay 
""
""
yeah
 
""
canadian chinese 
""
""
uh yeah yeah
""
uh she went to canada when she  ' s in high school
 
""
uh ha 
""
""
yeah
""
but uh in hong kong she is a lesbian also
 
""
do you know   what  lesbian is 
""
""
 yeah  
""
pardon
 
""
do you know what lesbian is 
""
""
what a lesbian is
 
""
yeah 
""
""
uhm  lesbian
""
lesbian lesbian uh mainly means uh girls have uhm preference 
have sexual preference to uhm  female   the  sun  
 
""
 uh ha  
""
same sex yeah 
""
""
yeah the same sex   yeah 
 
""
 uh  
""
so that mode of life normal do you think 
""
""
as a friend i think it  ' s normal    
""
i accept my friends to be like that
""
i don't have discrimination
""
but for myself i don't want to be a lesbian
 
""
 uh  
""
you don't want to be a lesbian 
""
""
yeah i i i prefer guys
 
""
that means not that you don't want to just as you aren't
""
i don't think you have any say of whether you want to be or not
""
""
you in the  one-word  or you  ' re not
""
you know i mean it  ' s not the   matter  one thing to
be something
""
it likes saying i want to be a girl though i  ' m not
""
i  ' m well 
""
it likes to say i want to   be a boy  or already i  ' m
a   boy  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 but whether  
""
 but   whether you want to be a lesbian or not
""
you can choose it i think
 
""
no i don't think we can choose it   i think  
""
""
 but   for you all the all uh whether you want to
be a boy or a girl you can't choose it
""
but whether you want to be a lesbian or or not you can choose it
  right 
 
""
 but i   can't choose it 
""
""
why
 
""
because it  ' s something that in the nature to your or not
""
i don't think you have a choice in it 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
do you think that she  she consciously chooses to be attracted
to the same sex
""
you think she chose that
""
do you think that one day she decided  i want to be attracted
to the same sex
""
so that  ' s what   i  one-word  mean 
""
""
""
 but i   think maybe the life experience have some
influence to them
 
""
you don't think that is  uh people are born that way 
""
""
i don't think so
 
""
why not 
""
""
uhm i think they they must have some experience to influence
their  pref  preference i think
 
""
uh why
""
what  ex  what  ex  what experience did you have
that influence you to like boys
""
what make you like boys 
""
""
uhm
""
maybe education i can   i can say  yeah
 
""
 education  
""
right so   somebody say you you  must like boys
""
so you say oh okay   i  ' m i like okay  
""
""
 when you  ' re when when you  ' re  si   
""
 no not you must not   you must
""
because uhm people educate you to be uh this is normal  
  people had uh
""
girls normally have to get along with guys
""
then  in your mind you will think that well it  ' s normal we
have to accept that
""
but for if but if  a girl get along with uhm  another girl
they are i  means  lesbian
""
people may  perceive them as uhm rather abnormal or strange
""
i think   education has 
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 so why   would you choose to be that
""
if you why would you choose to be abnormal and strange 
""
""
i think uh it  ' s  everybody experience is different
""
maybe their experience had some in has great influence to them
""
maybe uhm some of them don't have a good don't had a good time
with a guy and they 
""
i i don't know how to explain it
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uhm    i can i can 
 
""
 so will you   choose to be a lesbian if you waanna to
be
""
is that what you say
""
you can choose to be a lesbian 
""
""
i think so
 
""
uh 
""
""
i think so
 
""
so you can just decide to become a lesbian one day and you would
""
and you would   and and you won't  have any other
feeling
""
you won't have any feelings to boys at all
""
and all your attention would be on women   
""
if  you decide to do you would like that 
""
""
 uhm i i don't think  
""
 uhm  
""
i don't know
 
""
uh 
""
""
nobody knows
 
""
uh nobody   knows 
""
so you don't know then whether people are born that way or not do
you 
""
""
 nobody knows  
""
uhm
 
""
how can you say that  ex  experience so simple and you
don't know
""
  no one knows  
""
""
 then how about  
""
you you think it  ' s in
""
it  ' s a natural born for that this for this   preference
""
 
""
 wow i   don't think that anybody really knows either
""
maybe it  ' s true maybe it  ' s possible
""
all kind of things can happen when you are being born 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
do you have discrimination with gays or lesbians
 
""
me personally 
""
""
yeah
 
""
no none at all
""
  why  would i be
""
i  ' m not 
""
""
 uhm  
""
then do you mind to be uh do do you uh do you
""
have you ever uh got any experience that  uh you like guys
 
""
no not   really  no 
""
""
 no  
""
""
not really
 
""
no 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
  then how about 
 
""
 but even if   i did i still i still like women
""
it  ' s not going to change what my mind about that
""
so  you know i can't deciding  one-word  to
be gay all of the sudden 
 laughs 
""
and even if i decided to but    si si si  
doesn't work that way 
""
""
 uhm  
""
then how about you gloria
""
""
what
""
""
if now  a lesbian girls told you that she likes you then
what will you do  a long pause 
 
""
  try  it 
""
""
 no   
 laughs 
""
uhm maybe
 
""
yeah do you go 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
how do you know if you
""
how do you know if you don't try yeah 
""
""
yes 
 laughs 
 
""

""

""
""
maybe uh maybe i  ' m bisexual 
 laughs 
 
""
or maybe everybody has it inside them 
""
""
yes
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
maybe we have the ability to get along with both 
 laughs  
""
""
somebody somebody does have the ability i think
""
to to be bisexual
""
""
yes
 
""
maybe everybody has that ability 
""
""
maybe
""
""
like andy lau
""
""
i   think he  is i think he is
""
what do you think about andy lau
 
""
 uh ha  
""
i don't think about andy lau    
""
oh i don't think anything of him 
""
""

""
""

""
uh not interested in anything that he does at all
""
i  ' m not interested in his music  or his movies   or 
 anything at all
""
or andylau dot com
""
 abs  absolutely no  interesting  in it at all
""
i think there are many factor
""
i can't think anything of any the four kings you know 
""
""
 uh ha   
 and
 laugh 
""
what do what  what do you think about the hong kong uh movie
stars
 
""
uh 
""
uh some of them are okay sometimes  two-words 
maybe come out
""
maybe now and again but mostly it just formulaic
""
it  ' s formularized     just that they make money
""
and the stories are the  that  ' s
""
there are any stories for over  or they  ' re repetitive
""
but some of them are okay
""
i think  uh  jau sing chih   these cantonese
words are the chinese name of a hong kong movie star  is quite funny
sometimes 
""
""
 uh ha  
""
you understand all he said
 
""
some not of them either some of   them yeah  
""
""
 uh ha   
 laughs 
""
but most hong kong people criticize that hong uh  jau sing
chih  ' s   these cantonese words are the chinese name of a hong
kong movie star  film is uh rather rubbish
""
  though  it  ' s funny but it  ' s   it  ' s
meaningless 
 
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yes it  ' s  
""
meaningless
 
""
of course it  ' s meaningless but it  ' s entertainment
""
it  ' s not for  one-word 
""
it doesn't it doesn't  proposed to be anything serious
""
  and i  think any hong kong film does that 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah
 
""
 two-words  entertain 
""
""
no uh
 
""
sometimes i find i don't mind watching hong kong movies  
 then  maybe laugh
""
but i i think they quite ridiculous
""
but i think it  ' s supposed   to be  ridiculous
anyway 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
then do you think uh hollywood movies are better than hong kong
movies
 
""
uh generally no
""
i don't see any 
""
you can say that they spend more money on them so the  art
direction and the  filmo  and the filmography is better 
""
uhm  but  i don't know how to say really
""
  i haven't  seen any really good hollywood movies for
long time either 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
have you seen any movies recently gloira?
""
""

""
""

""
""
stuart little
""
""
stuart
""
""
stuart little
 
""
stuart little 
""
""
uh
""
""
who who  ' s the
""
  uh i don't know 
 
""
 i think it  ' s  one-word    getting
getting   one-word  walking around 
""
""
yeah
""
""
yeah
""
okay  one-word  
""
okay uh i i i don't know what  ' s the movie that you  ' re talking
about
""
what  what is it about
""
can you tell me
""
""
it  ' s about a  mou  mouse
""
""
mouse
""
""
yes
""
""
is it a cartoon   or 
""
""
 no  
""
uh  tut  the  tut  the characters is uh created by
 by by technology
""
""
uh   i see  i see 
""
i see i know i   know 
""
""
 do you know which one  
""
 it  ' s   very cute
""
""
i know
""
""
yes
""
""
but uh other than this
""
uh have you  watch  any uhm  category three movies
recently
""
""
uh let me think about it 
""
recently
""
""
yeah
""
""
uhm   tut 
""
yes uhm but i don't know the english name
""
""
i see
""
  i think  uh there are so many horror movies
recently    
""
and uh i think uh they  ' re they  ' re not very scary actually
""
because uh  the story or the techniques  use  are using
is uh more or less the same
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
you mean scream three
""
""
uh  no i mean uh those are japanese or or uh   
 hong kong horror   ring 
""
yeah yeah yeah ring
""
i think uh the techniques they are using are almost the same 
  
""
i think it  ' s it  ' s not scary any longer because uh  the
magazines and the newspaper  al  always uh  tell the  stor 
tell uh    the whole  story   before  we watch
it
""
so uh we don't have any uhm surprise when we  ' ll we  ' re looking at
it
""
""
 oh  
""
 movies  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
yes
""
so uh i have same  tut  uh feelings too
""
because uh before the  uh magazines  uh uh tell the people
about the story of ring 
""
uh i have gone to the  uhm uh theatre and  si 
""
i  ' m watch the film
""
i think it  ' s  very good 
 laughs 
""
it  ' s very scary
