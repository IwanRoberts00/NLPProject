 actually i i ' ve no idea now  i ' m waiting for uh universities ' reply from the usa    and if they defer me i ' ll stay in hong kong    uhm   okay  oh oh alright that sounds good  okay anything more you ' d like to ask we should be talked to wing wing see what she has to say   uhm uhm  i think no   no more okay thank you spring that is very interesting  you ' re welcome   okay wing wing so let ' s start with you   yeah  okay   okay so can you tell me if you enjoy staying with your parents that ' s my question for you  oh i enjoy the time with my parents i love my father and mother very much  and they teach me they take care of me and they earn money for me to have a better living standard  and i can learn si study in this school with my friends  i like to study with my friends happily    and we can play together everyday we have our lunch we have the lessons and we can laugh together i like that thing     uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  do you think you will when you grow up in future when you go to university  okay so i ' ll say that again so do you think if if you in future okay when you grow up go to university or will you still keep in touch with the friends you made in true light  i think i will  because they we are very friendly together  and i think our living style are the same   uh we like things the same and we can say something or when we are unhappy we are we will stay we will say things to each other to share the  feelings     uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  do you think your friends understand you more than parents or teachers people of that generation  some of them will understand me more than my parents uh because i think i stay with my friends one-word  have more time than my parents  so they know what i am    uhm uhm   uhm uhm  oh i see   and  laugh  yeah i think that ' s true right why do you think young people find it easier to uh relate to their friends and not their parents like uh for example you said you you your parents love you very much  but why do you feel you you ' re just an example so why do you think   because  i think we are the young people we are in the same age and haves the  thinking the thinking we are in si the same  so i i think we can know each other more than our parents yeah    uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  what can you say about uh young people who have problems at the school who uhm have problems behaving when at school or out in society do you think there ' s any uhm uh do you think their parents are in any way responsible for the way they behave  thing can one-word something  i think  i think their parents need to do something  because uh why the student have the bad behaviour because the parents didn't take care of them  so they the students do anything outside the parents didn't know that  and the so that the parents need to talk to their children more or   so that they will not be so bad    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uh but do you think it ' ll help because uh from what you said the early one-word  it seems that if young people will prefer to listen to their friends more than their parents  but that if the bad behave for is too bad  and they need their parents advice yeah yeah yeah    uhm uhm   to talk to them  i think that ' s a good point okay so do you have anything more to say about this friends and parents  shall we go to the next topic  no   not  yeah   so what is it name a favorite tv program and what is it about yeah   yeah  i love watching television i ' ll watch the television program every night at the exactly time  and     uhm what time is that  nine thirty  yeah the the the television program is at the freeze hole of an era  this program is talking about the businessmen how they handle their business and how to have a good competition in the market  the program is very exciting and my whole family like to see and enjoy it    okay   uh ha   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh right  uhm why do you watch it  because that uh at that time uh it ' s long time ago i have nothing to do and i watch the television   that and it it attract me to go on to watch it so i watch which and now i ' m watching also    uhm uhm   uhm  the same program  yeah   okay so are you interested in business then  uhm   as you said this program was all about businessmen right  i like to i like to see something need to fight  to each other uh they have competition  uh so i like that kind of program yeah    oh okay   uhm uhm  so you said that it was some time ago when you had time so does that mean that now you are not so free anymore    and so what

the people feel and how do they think   yeah yeah yeah   laughs  well uh maybe  i i don't know how uh i don't know the english name of of the of the of the film that i have had i ' ve watch before tut   uh   uh ha   that ' s o that ' s okay forget it  one-word uh we i don't have time to watch movies recently actually because   but but the but but uh uh it ' s the movie is talk about uh a man fall in  love with a young girl  uh ha  you you don't know the name of it i forgot the name oh that ' s okay   laughs  that ' s okay  recently we have so so much work to do and i don't think we will have time to watch movies   yes   yes yes  but uh yesterday i have uh spent a lot uh a whole day to watch the japa japanese si si  series  uh ha   uh how can you be like that  how can you be like that  one-word  when will you when will you finish your  exams   one-word  uh at the end of may at the end of may   uh   yeah   and i plan maybe if i if i can't go to europe for one or two months and i maybe go to the to go to egypt or india but it ' s very dangerous if you if you you will join tour or what   yes yes yes how much is it i don't know   i don't know  uh  i want to go to india also yeah but one-word my boyfriend  doesn't want me to go why because he said uhm india ' s dirty and also  dangerous  uh ha  but i think if you join tour it ' s not a problem because if you join a tour uh they will give you the uh  best hotels or uh the things uh  or the things you eat will be much better than those  stands than those uh you buy at the street uh in street i think uhm maybe uhm uhm i want to go to uhm the us again  ngaai  cantonese=interjection-of-regret-or-disgust  i want to go to the us again i i think it ' s i think it ' s quite fun if you go to the those big cities and i want to go to las vegas because last time when i went to us uhm i ' m under twenty one and people and people don't allow me to go to gamble   laughs  and this time uh i ' m i ' m twenty two now i want to go there and gamble   laughs  so that ' s the main reason that you want to go to us uh no no uh be because uh las vegas is a very uh famous city  and i i want to go there because last time i have just spent about uhm a week in la i think it ' s not enough  uhm   yeah  do you think american is kind americans uh i don't know because i ' ve just been there for a week but i think uhm the blacks uh may uh discriminate the chinese i think uh once uh when i when i went to a cafe and uh the black uh said some jokes to me  even though i don't understand but i think uh his his purpose of doing so is not good  and at the end uh he said hey i ' m just kidding i am just kidding i i i just want to ask him to fuck fuck off   and  laughs   uhm   yeah  are you going to transcribe this in your project oh i i think it ' s doesn't matter  one-word uh i think it ' s doesn't matter  because at that time i ' m just uh alone and i ' m  i ' m not dare to do anything i just uh go went away and that ' s it i think so i think if you ' re if we went uh travelling it ' s better to have guys get along with us  okay   uhm   uhm  yes it ' s much more safe than being alone  yeah  especially go to europe  yeah  yeah yeah as i have said in italy many people uh just uh si  steal stole things and the they ' re they ' re in a gangs and especially those gypsies and a friend told me that the uh the gypsies were will uh hold the baby and when they see the tourists they will give the baby they will they ' ll throw the baby to you and if you the and and and uh automatically  you will put out your hand to get to hold the baby but at that moment you hold the baby they will get all your belongings and ran away  so
