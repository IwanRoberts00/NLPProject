<I>
judging by the performance you did on the quiz i notice that
most of you had one-word the basic content of the text
okay so you don't have any problem in understanding the text
so we won't spend too much time on the details okay go through text
with you and that ' s one of the advantage of having a quiz
okay we don't have to repeat the whole story again
so when you come to the reading of the text you can summarize the
whole play in a chart form okay and this important
why is it so 
simply because if you are doing many literary study or comparative
literature study
the most important thing is that you need to note the details okay
before you can compare works okay so whenever you come across any text the
most important thing for you to do is to do a kind of summary for your own
reference
okay and by doing something like this like i giving you just an an
example how you should approach when you are reading any text
okay then you will be able to find out the similarities more
easily okay with all these uh uh key points highlighted okay
in other words you won't be what crowded by the details of the play
so that you won't be able to see what ' s the essential one-word
 commonly found in both works alright
so the most important thing when you look at the prologue okay is
what as i ' ve mention last time is the fact that it gives you a time
structure which is similar to one-word book okay and
that ' s the most important point
and so when you look at the prologue what is presented there is
simply a conversation between two catholic uh catholic sister or catholic
nuns
okay and this particular conversation was actually overheard by two
children a young boy and a young girl okay
so you what is important in this particular prologue 
what function does this prologue serve in the play and that is
something we need to uh uh look at it in greater detail okay
what sort of function does it serve here 
anybody daisy
 
the start of play with uh minor characters giving us uh
information uhm or better that one-word 
right first of all it provides you with the basic information
okay and to introduce the key characters before their actual appearance on
the stage
and at the same time as we have uh mention during the tutorial hour
the most important thing is what is that it allows you uh allows the author
to ask a few questions okay
what happens to this zhou family in the past
what happen to these two mad women that we come to know at the
beginning of the play okay
what happen what has happened in the past to these particular
family okay
and that ' s why using the these two outsiders that is the children
 factor okay as someone you drop it okay uh the conversation
the one-word that is our you useless 
problem perspective to look at at they from the angle of these
outsiders in order to arouse our curiosity to learn more
and that when you come to the end of the prologue that when it ' s
 starts okay intervenes
so as audience okay we are all very interested to learn more about
this zhou family and that ' s happen to uhm people in the past okay
so this is a way uh of uhm releasing information in order to hold
the attention and the interest of the audience
okay and this is some information that several words
so that ' s what we have a uh found out in the prologue and when we
come to act one
okay so all these stage directions are things that you need to know
as well especially if you ' re doing influence study
okay and especially in this uh the thing
so first thing is that you see a lapse of ten years okay between
the prologue at act one okay so it goes back in time from the present in the
prologue to ten years ago okay
and then you will note also the value of the plays from that
would happen is in the same room okay
throughout the whole play is in the same room and in the summer
morning okay 
how about the atmosphere it ' s low atmosphere with a grey sky and
no sunshine so it ' s the summer morning but it ' s not bright
it is an open part start okay and as mention in stage direction is
what is a rain threatening sky 
so with the title of the play being thunderstorm this is what an
appropriate setting being an appropriate atmosphere for something hollow
so all these things in with reference to the uh place to the
time of the year to the atmosphere of the day et cetera all these are what
directly related to what ' s going to happen in the play later on
okay so it ' s psy all these things psychologically prepare
the audience
okay for the events to be released to us later on okay so all
these are things that you need to know as a reader
and then what cover in act one are simply very simple
first of all you find that zhou pu yuan is described as an
authority okay and how would you describe him as an authority 
this is a very good quiz question anyway where was he educated
 germany
 germany 
 right he was educated in germany
so do you consider him as a westernized chinese man or do you
consider him as a traditional as a traditional chinese gentleman
how would you describe zhou pu yuan as a character
ivy so where ' s ivy 
how would you describe him
given the fact that he was educated in germany would you describe
him as a westernized chinese gentlemen or would you re uh consider
him as a traditional chinese 
 
 here 
 traditional 
traditional
how can you tell that he ' s traditional and not westernized
 
his ideas on family 
his idea on
 
on structure 
on the structure of the family
what ' s his idea on structure of the family
 
the wife should be o 
the wife must be obedient to
 
to her husband 
to the husband
okay that ' s one thing and at the same time can you find the scene
where he forces fa yi to take the medicine
what sort of medicine chinese medicine chinese herbal medicine
so in that case the chinese herbal medicine can be seen as
a symbol of tradition the chinese tradition okay so we given the fact that he
was educated in germany in the west he still prefer chinese herbal medicine
to western okay
describe medicine by uhm uhm two-words okay
and at the same time when you look at hill okay
the reason when you look at the way he forces fa yi to take the
medicine you notices uh you notice what that 
first of all the relationship between the husband and the wife
what sort of relationship to describe it 
anyone jacqueline 
what sort of relationship would you describe in the play between
the husband and wife 
is it a harmonious relationship so is what
 
no love between their marriage 
right it ' s a marriage based not on love but on what 
domination and submission
so it ' s another way of showing his authority again
in other words zhou zhou pok yuan treats fa yi as in the same way
as he treat his children
okay forcing her to take the medicine and why does she refuses to
take the medicine
is it because she is very childlike she doesn't like the bitter
taste of the chinese herbal medicine or why why does she refuse to take
the one-word medicine 
 don't one-word, two-words, etc
anyone dennis
 
she is two-words 
right it ' s not it has nothing to do with the medicine okay
but she doesn't like the idea of being forced to do anything okay
and that ' s why through this particular scene we come to see her
rebellious character first of all and her relationship with her husband which
is not based on love but based on domination and absolute obedience
from the two-words 
and that what signals trouble in their marriage to au 
to the audience at the very beginning
okay so this is very important and you also notice that fa yi like
to do something in particular
she has a character thing
what does she like to do 
she likes to open the several replies windows right so
what does it signify 
what ' s the air in the house right 
okay she likes to open the window meaning that she wants some
 fresh air and that implies the the room is suffocated
is it really suffocated it may be so because it ' s a summer day
right but at the same time it ' s more a reflection of her not her
physical condition but her mental and spiritual yearning for some sort of
release okay from a uh uh yearning for a grasp of fresh air from 
apply 
okay so all these are are very clearly reveal to us okay uh in the
first act and that ' s why when you look at the first act the most important
thing is this establishment of zhou pu yuan ' s position as the authority in
the family and everyone in the family has to submit to his or to his rule
okay
and through the one- word strike mention in
act one we learn to know more too
how he behaves as what as the boss in his own family
he ' s again the authority there
it was his power and challenge okay
and then at the same time the most important issue presented
in act one is this one-word relationship between zhou
chung zhou ping si feng and fa yi
okay we ' ll come to learn about this very complicated love affair
okay uh uh among all these young people okay and we consider fa yi as a young
woman too because she is just in her mid thirties okay
so in your quiz if you answer that the uh love relationship was
between zhou pok yuan and fa yi and then zhou chung ping and si feng is wrong
because they don't form a fair relationship
they are two love relationship suffer okay and it ' s not uh
related to anymore
so this again shows the what what we call the enclosed environment
in this particular uh uh play okay
that young people had no much opportunity outside the family to
know other people of the same class
young people of the same class okay and that ' s why it ' s only
natural that they feel attractive to one another within the same
family although they belong to different classes
okay some are servants then other are masters et cetera okay but
it doesn't matter
okay as long as they are young they belong to same group and it ' s
easy for them to get along with each other okay so that ' s the key point here
so we learn about this very complicated uh uh relationship between
the characters in this uh first uh first act okay
and when we come to act two what you find is the same day okay
after lunch on the same day the sky is mentioned again
so with all these constant references to the condition of the
climate show to you what importance of the cli climate okay climatic
condition with this particular play
it ' s after lunch the sky is grey again atmosphere continue to be
low atmosphere okay and what you find is the regulation of zhou ping 
problem okay
he feels what trouble and he suffer because of something and we
learn in act two okay as a continuation of the act of act one we learn about
the cause of his suffering
what he is suffering from a duty conscious
now he is developing or he has one uh an abnormal relationship
with his stepmother fa yi okay so that ' s something which has been
troubling him as a young man
okay as a young man of the moral self okay for a long time and we
come to learn about the cause of his suffering
the cause of his unhappiness okay when we come to act two
and then at the same time we see the contrast between his
association with fa yi which it him not like but a sense of happiness
okay and that ' s why you remember that when we first come to see
zhou ping he is considered as a young man with a very pale looking appearance
okay
in other words all this love or this affair with his stepmother as
 one-word is one-word of it
and he doesn't or or we may say that he has never enjoy his
relationship with his stepmother
and in act two we see this contrast that be mentioned between his
affair with his stepmother and one-word to si feng
okay si feng as an entirely different kind of young woman
okay young fresh light okay and he feels very relax and
comfortable when he get along with si feng very different from the kind of
association he has with the stepmother
okay so here you see his struggle as a young man he
yearns for a normal natural love relationship 
and this is something that we uh come to understand certain
 and at the same time in act two we find a further development of zhou
ping and si feng ' s relationship okay and this is something uh you can uh
look at okay
and the important thing in this particular act is what
introduction of the the return of he was the key character like zhou
pok yuan linking the present and the past okay
and i ' ve mentioned during the tutorial that zhou pok yuan is the
only character that runs from the beginning of the play from the prologue to
the end he ' s the only one linking the present to the past okay
and here in act two you find the return of uh the si ping okay and
she is seen as a key character that who links this past with the present okay
or the present with the past
