i agree that we can postpone the tutorial questions on deductions to next week alright but then i told him that uh i decide not to cancel the tutorial class today due to the fact that i will consider it ' s benefit to you by making use of the time okay ask any question that you come across in the learning process on any topics or issue that we already cover during the last lecture okay so you are allowed to ask any question or any issue that you have either in encounter from the textbook or uh from last lecture or even from tutorial or from tutorial questions in case if you have no question to ask me because you consider that well you can grasp all the issues or all the concept or principles then i will make use of the time to discuss with you the current topic which is the deduction rule under salary tax okay so let me allow you to have one- word uh time to think over concerning with any question that you have  and of course next week then we continue our presentation and two relevant question will be question uh thirteen and sorry question twelve and also question thirteen okay on deduction  so so far any problem that you encounter in the learning process  a long pause  so let ' s start from very beginning so how about say for topic one concerning with general administration  the structure of the inland revenue department the powers of the assessor or the commissioner issue assessment uhm obtaining information the official secrecy rules  how about say the public tool concerning with uh one direct tax property tax the scope of charge the estimate of income a cantonese sentence from a student  uh well let let me remind you because today we have a one visitor this young lady okay that uh we have to conduct the tutorial in english due to the fact that uh she is doing some sort of research work concerning with some sort of uh terms in english that usually lecturer or student used either in the mass lecture or in the tutorial okay i think that research is very useful in the future so that at least then it may find out the recent or some common terms that you use and what ' s the meanings okay so that ' s why then uh if you don't mind then i will suggest then why not then we we ask the question by english and i will ex explain to you in english as well unless that you feel problems of course in that case then perhaps then we can ask the approval first okay so  uh can you explain the case about two-words  uh calculation of property tax uh calculation of you mean the estimate of the income the taxable income under property tax okay no problem so obviously you know uhm for the estimate of income under profit tax it should be divided into altogether two stage okay so the si the first stage would be the it ' s talking about the estimate of the accessible value  alright and then you got the second stage which is the estimate  of the net accessible value so by the by the by the word net which means then well it ' s  from the accessible value you can deduct certain items so then you got a net amount so we call it call it a net accessible value okay and of course under the revenue law for the estimate of accessible value then you have to look at the section five big b okay and it ' s start with the subsection two three four and then you got a five okay and then together with section seven big c okay so for this one i think i already explain to you in details uh in tutorial two that well the issue that you have to take into account would be the subject matter for the estimate of av is talking about consideration okay it ' s also consideration in money or sometimes in money ' s worth okay because of the term money ' s worth then you need to pay attention to in case if the rent is paid in uh by benefits in kind in lieu of rank  in money then you have to look at whether that benefit in kind would be so called money ' s worth or not so it ' s really depends on like say your salary tax depends on whether that benefit in kind can be either convertible into money or it can be talking about discharging of uh the landlord ' s liability that kind of things okay and of course another important issue of co relating to the estimate of uh accessible value in terms of consideration fee then you must have a direct relationship for the purpose for the payment of consideration and the relationship must be that is for the right of use of property not for other purposes  alright so then if you satisfy all these condition then the consideration should be take in account for the estimate of accessible value okay and this section is merely supplement this section only further elaborate that in that case then if you have a payment made by tenant  to a landlord rather than directly for it ' s in terms of provision of service and so on that ' s would be in included as consideration for the right of use of property okay and then for the for the rest these two text section is talking about well a treatment of the special item call the premium okay so how describe the premium what ' s the maximum number of months that you can spread the premium okay and this section obviously is concerning with the bad debt because  due to the principle that well usually the accessibility arises or the liability arises when you have the rent income payable to you or consider payable to you okay but then subsequently you may discover that i did not receive the rent okay but due to the fact that you have been assessed because it ' s payable then you have the liability arises alright so they must allow you to have deduction in case if subsequently you can't receive the rent and then you write off as bad debt okay so that ' s concerning with the estimate of the av now of course the next would be section five one big a this is concerning with the estimate of the net av and you know once you got a av the deduction that you can have would be two items one item would be in terms of rates and the condition would be agreed and paid by the landlord alright and then i think we already come uh discuss about the situation that when a tenant pay the rent okay usually if the ten pay the rate which is a usual case in practice nowaday in the market when you sign a lease agreement with your landlord normally the rent so paid by you will be exclusive of rates and lecture fee in other words the tenant will responsible pay out okay so if that ' s the case normally the rent uh the ratio paid by the tenant will not be included as income on one hand and it will not be allowed as deduction on the other hand okay the other item for deduction purpose to estimate the net av will be the stationary allowance that twenty percent okay so that ' s the law alright and the stages and of course as a skeleton you can see that in those case and normally for the calculation of tax taxable income under property tax would be we may have item like the rent common item and then you may have a premium  okay and that ' s being already a portioned according to the three or four sections okay and then you may have some other items okay which is talking about benefits in kinds  and that ' s also pay for the right of use of rent okay and then you come to have a subtotal and then where you can have the deduction of the irrecoverable rent if any alright and then you got this amount we call it the uh the accessible value av and thereafter you can further deducts first of all is the rates agreed and paid by you so another deduction and then well then you got another subtotal alright and then you base on that you can further deduct another item which is this that twenty percent stationary allowance which would be applied on this subtotal so you got another one and then the net amount will be so called the net av and then base on that you can apply your standard rate and then you have the property tax liable  so that ' s normally the skeleton to compute or to estimate  the taxable income under property tax and of course well different cases then you have different elements include in this skeleton particularly for the items to be included as consideration okay what are these out are some of the commoned items like rent premium okay or sometimes you may have golden watch golden ring diamond ring okay these benefit in kind okay of course then you may have some sort of peculiar item i don't know it ' s case by case case by case okay depends on circumstances but any how then well when you look at whether this element will be included as a consideration for the purpose of estimating the av or not then go back to the ornament in the statue okay see whether it satisfy your condition whether it can said to be it may worth and the most important would be whether it ' s for the right of use of property or not alright so so did i answer your question  uhm uhm i want to uhm uhm uhm more about the case which is presented by miss cheung you mean the tutorial question  uhm which one a long pause  question uh we have altogether two uh property tax uh altogether uh three so four five question four question four and question six so which one  question five question five you want to know what the whole question or which item a long pause  so the main theme of this question is really talking about you have a a landlord or owner of a property  uh about question four question four okay  question four or five several replies  well indeed what ' s what ' s what ' s what ' s the point of issue so it ' s relating to what relating to several replies and a long pause what several replies   unrelieve rent okay so in this particular case we must be question five then alright so in question five then obviously you can see that well first of all you got a landlord or owner of a property who lend out his property for rental income purpose alright and then he receive a premium as well as monthly rent and the the rate was paid by the tenant alright  but then no the the rate was paid by the landlord the owner alright and then unfortunately on thirty first of march ninety one the tenant vacate the flat with six months rent in a rear okay and then the landlord lost the contact on whereabout of uh mr lo he can't find him and finally he learn that uh that tenant left hong kong in july ninety one okay so then i think that ' s the the point of issue so obviously in this case then you know that there altogether six months rent in a rear so the rent become payable but actually the landlord or the owner did not receive the rent alright and of course according to the wording under the statute because it emphasizes on payable then we say that in a year which is obviously ninety ninety one the year in question in nineteen ninety one then you still have to assess the landlord or the owner in respect of that six months rent because although he did not receive it but the rent satisfy the word payable the rent was still and is payable okay so in that case and for nineteen ninety one the six months rent should be included in the estimate of av first it ' s only up to say in july ninety one when the landlord or the owner learn that the tenant the ex-tenant left hong kong then we say that in this case he can satisfy that he prove to the assessor that the rent so in a rear become irrecoverable  okay so then he can make use of the section seven big c subsection one okay and then claim deduction of the irrecoverable rent but now the year in concern is the following year which is the year ninety one ninety two okay and the remaining question obviously would be when you look at ninety one ninety two  you are entitled to claim irrecoverable rent so you well let ' s assume that this is ninety one ninety two so you can have the deduction okay here the remaining question is whether the income this subtotal would be sufficient to absorb the proper rent or not okay so then you have you have to read the rest of the question and then later on you discover that well after the vacation the property uh was  relet on the first january only for the last three months only and then on nominal rent only so that ' s why they the income this subtotal will become only well uh thirty thousand isn't it by five thousand yes five thousand per month okay so you can only deduct thirty thousand only alright out of that six months in proper rent okay and then of course then for those unrelieve amount according to the section seven big c subsection three then you can what you can carry backward and set out against the most recent year av okay and of course in this case other than you got the nominal rent when you relet your property you also have the tax payer uh that is the tenant the ex-tenant return to hong kong and he agree to pay the rent in a rear in the past back to you but by free instalment okay and then you you you also have the dealing section that if the rent is subsequently recover and that has been written off before then the subsequent recover recovery of rent will deem to be a consideration and and item for the av purpose so that ' s why in addition to the this fifteen thousand you may also have to add uh one third of the rent recover okay so that ' s the computation of the a net av so i don't know whether this is your particular point or not or perhaps uh you can point out well which uh item you you can't understand then i can elaborate more on on the issue  yes
