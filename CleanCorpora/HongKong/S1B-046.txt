<I>
 
good morning
this is jonathan fenby welcoming you to this the latest in our
saturday morning interviews lock here on radio three
i ' m editor of the south china morning post and sunday morning post
and each saturday morning i talk to leading figure in hong kong
about uh himself or herself about what ' s on their mind this weekend about
their life career and how they see the future of the territory
i ' m very pleased to have my guest this morning democratic party
legislator law chi kwong who ' s uh part of the party secretary
representative for the social welfare profession and also the democratic
party spokesperson on health and woman issues
 one-word hello a woman speaks a
woman ' s issue 
 yeah 
uh we don't have any one inter legco who is female 
for the for the for the democratic party 
 laughs 
 
 the 
so that ' s for you
how did you get into politics 
uh i have been participating in a social movements in helping
people to fight for more uh uh a a better welfare for the for the uh uh
under privilege
i always been playing the role as a more like a a 
one-word of assisting helping uh uh discussing policy and things
like that
but but since nineteen ninety early nineteen ninety uh we are
facing the election in nineteen ninety one 
at that time i i al i always discussing with
friends and said that uh it ' s i i do consider it ' s very important to form a
democratic party as such and to unite all the different small groups 
 together so that we stand a chance of uh winning
the election in nineteen ninety one because of the limited number of people
we have and the limited resource that we have
if we don't group together and uh resolve the
conflict within a party rather than among groups
 
 uhm 
 yeah uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
how many groups were there at that time one-word
 
they were they were over the place 
 numerous numerous and they all over the place
but there ' s such several major groups major
groups but but then uh in in a past experience in terms of uh district broad
elections uhm uh urban council election
because they they are all not to together so so at the time when
they decided i i would go for election and then sudden discover another group
have another representative standing the same same
same constituency then
then it ' s very hard to resolve at that stage 
once you make all those de decision go through all the processes and
then sudden realize that there ' s competition from a friendly group
 so the the best thing is to have all those things
resolved before decision was made 
so so the party is something i ' ve i would consider as essential
so that time okay let ' s let ' s get together and then started uh
forming a a party so we form the united democrats of hong kong at that time
i i was particularly uh tut sort of responsible for
the uh organizing in terms of policy research the researcher and how
how they can assist the party in forming uh pla platforms uh
election platform so the nineteen ninety one election
so from that time onwards i i i was in the party
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 same yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
you were you were organizer 
part of the organizer yeah 
 
 yeah yeah yeah 
and at that point coming to your background you come from
did you see the formation of the party and the party if you like
sitting down roots has been largely concerned with livelihood issues 
rather than with uh make a political matters 
i i would say both are very important uh
 running up to nineteen ninety seven we all know that uh to to develop
a more uh open and a free society is very important for the
transition
and for political party which will stand firm on this issue it ' s
very important 
we know that people will will start changing their position from
time to time and they when they get closer to nineteen ninety
seven
so we should have a party which which have a substantial force
 consolidation of power within the community which can stand firm 
 and that would give very important confidence for people in
hong kong who ' s who who would know that at the time of this difficult time
there are are people who are consideral in terms of uh number
and power in in in in uh hong kong which would stand firm on this issue
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
are we two words uh 
 certain principle like democracy open 
society uh free competition things like that
 uhm but the same time we are the group of
people in the seventies and eighties who are primary concerned with uh
livelihood issue so so so so so they they they is a uh uh
uh one-word of two concerns together 
uh because of this group of people who are or the same time concern
about uh livelihood issue at the time concern about issue
like democracy freedom and uh and and open society
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 one-word coming for one-word
 background 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
you know television interview few weeks ago uh tung chee hwa was
asked about livelihood issue
he said was what ' s most on people ' s mind as against 
political liberties
he said the first was more important one-word 
he he personally place the first more important the second
do you think any conflict between the two
i mean it seems to me actually they they are different 
uh to certain extent it ' s true if if we talk about uh people ' s
concern they are always more concern about about their
own livelihood issues
so when you ask them what are the issue they are more concern but
uh when you ask the people about what are the major concern of the transition
 that will change 
uh if you ask people about interest or concerns about the
transition then they will talk more about freedom
 they ' ll talk more about demo democracy
and this sort these are the things uh they are more concern
but if you talk about what what what are your concern in your daily
life
they ' ll talk about livelihood so so it depends on the question you
<{5 ask 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 the way you ask it
 but it ' s also is there a link in the in a an open a
free society it ' s more likely that the tensional replace to uhm
disparities in in welfare and labour and living condition and so on
in fact the two there ' s a connection 
 yes 
exactly exactly
uh without a free open and and a democratic society it ' s very
difficult to protect those livelihood issues and to the 
particular the weak yes 
yes indeed and uh and also wou when when there is a more
democratic society then people will the the voices of those under privilege
will be more outspoken will be will be heard and discussion in society
so they are they ' re closely related and and that ' s why we
are the group of people who are concerned with both issues 
 
 uhm to one-word it among the weak 
the strong voice 
 don't you yes uh 
how do you think hong kong gov in terms of looking after
the under privilege the poor the weak 
 uhm 
well i would say from time to time i feel shameful uh as a person
in a social welfare field
from time to time we see people in who are suffering
from time to time we see all these hardships and yet we we are
not just doing enough to help them
and uh thinking in terms of hong kong as the eight eighth
largest business community and all all those uh uh numbers so
and so in in the world and yet we have such a group of people still living in
 one-word in in a commute 
i think it ' s some sometimes very shameful
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
oh are you put your one-word you always got
to have in this society a number of people who are on the margin outside
society even is small a number class 
well in very society there exist a group of people like this
 but it depends on whether that uh the income discrab
 disparity so that in enormous 
in hong kong is particularly great is great is grow from
point point five eight something for the uh uh uh one- word
 efficient
 and and it ' s it ' s i i i i the the the
number that i know of like for the us is point three something 
 and uh and uh still they have lot of one-word 
homeless united states and they in in you talk about
the income disparity in hong kong you will expect their their state of of
living is very poor
imagine a person who walk uh who work from seven to eleven 
 uh uh and yet earning something like four to five thousand
dollars that is incredible and yet if they have to live in a
room uh what we call wooden partition room a hundred square
feet
now the rent go ups to to three thousand dollars
 
i i visit macau uh uh two days ago
and uh and uh for three thousand dollars they they can have a a a
one thousand square feet flat already but here in hong
kong you can only only have a one hundred square feet wooden partition 
 room 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 one-word is grow isn't it grow to
something as the same one-word yes 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm
is the one-word development of the
economy here to run down manufactory and so on
is that actually increasing the pressure on those who would have
a job in manufacturing in the past
there is less job and they ' re say mid age they 
mid age and counter that to a new job opportunities 
yes that into easy one of the uhm the cause as if all these
uh hardships among the uh lower class
and i would say it ' s because the the the the demand for labour
 uh now is particular skill towards service industries 
and for the lower part of the service industry the pay is always
very low 
and the the this this the monthly pay for for jobs like working in
mcdonald and and the fast food shop had haven't been 
uh we finds in the past five to ten years it ' s
 still the same rate
 
 yeah 
 two-words 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm
but it ' s higher so that rate here and say some competing
economies in china for instance 
 oh so so much higher and and yet the
cost of living but the cost yeah in terms of wage yes but but in terms
of cost of living in terms of purchasing power of that 
 particular low wage 
 
 yeah one-word in terms of of cost 
living 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 is that all for the company so cheaper to do
the job somewhere else 
oh yes yes yes yes yes 
 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm
so what is your uh the attitude reduce about the budget on
social welfare
i was using the word one-word you probably
use something stronger 
i would say it ' s a very mean budget uhm
we we have all these money save save in our in in in in the government and
yet
there there are so many livelihood issues of the particularly the
poor the disadv it is advantage and yet they are not being
adequately look after
uhm may may be it ' s because it ' s a transitional so call
transitional budget and uh the chinese government do not
like to see a two digit growth and so they they artificially 
yeah yeah sunday 
and i think it ' s basically artificial to cut it down to below
something below two digit
 and uh but but then but then a lot of things 
that we have planned to to improve like social disable service of the elderly
service of the families
they have to reduce the growth 
uh even below the growth in terms of demand
so we will expect a growing shortage in some of the services
longer waiting list and heavier workload for everybody in the welfare
uhm because we we artificially try to reduce a growth rate when
the demand in fact grow much faster than that
for like the cssa the growth rate for those who are unemploy
 getting in to this social welfare is something like
seventeen percent last year sixteen percent for the low income groups fifteen
percent of the single parent families and well something
lower for the elderly still eighteen percent
the growth are so phenomenal and yet you try to
cut the growth rate which doesn't really match with the growth in
demand
and the growth of need of the very the the the lower part of
the of the society
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 two-words basic call uh 
one-word 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah 
uhm uhm
do you think i mean that was striking uh the extend the the
try the bread reaction and legco to the budget with you and the liberals
 were finding yourself uh speaking almost the same language for once
there
do you think uh anything will change 
or is it is this budget is that set and that ' s it 
well my wish is something will change uh but
 the the the sixteen will vote on it
 on the ninth and the tenth we will debate 
 on so everyone will will be talking about about the the budget
 and it welfare part
but i but what i ' ve been trying to persuade the other legco
members uh from liberal party from the other other the the left and the
right is that there ' s not enough just to talk about it just
 to say you are not pleased you are not happy with it
you got to do something
 because well that we we have uh a executive lack
government and we have to convince them we have to do something rather than
just saying for the past few years already we ' ve been talking about
increasing the cssa standard rate for the elderly and uh
that was starting from nineteen ninety four we almost setting enormous
 view about how much we should rise
 and yet up to today three years later we still
taking about
that is we are not happy with it but we ' re not doing
anything
 
 what ' s it command comes up two-words 
the 
 sixteen 
 yes 
 debate yes 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
so what can be done 
well you have to use some sort of threat like
uh you you will vote down the budget 
 
 uhm 
 is that you vote down the budget is the whole
you try to amend parts of it 
yeah this this ' s a option this ' s a option the 
men well amending part of it is basically symbolic rather 
 than 
 
 uhm uhm 
 well unless you get what you want 
yes and that ' s we ' ve got what we want uh voting down the
budget is the same thing
 we know that uh the gov this particular
transitional govern is only uh three three three three months to
go uh 
and and uh even we vote down the budget it won't stop it
still have the emergency money to to to go around play
with until until the the first of july
but but that is a very important symbolic meaning we have to tell
the government of how determine we are in asking for a reasonable increase
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm 
this is jonathan fenby talking to law chi kwong on radio three
this saturday morning
if you were suddenly you woke up tomorrow morning and you
were the financial secretary what was the first two or three
things you do 
 uhm uhm 
ha ha that ' s a very difficult question because i never dream of
that 
 laughs 
 
uhm uhm
but i ask you because one-word people
criticize legislators criticize the executive and say should do this should
do that but if you actually in their shoes 
oh definitely i would i would immediately increase three
hundred dollars for the elderly per month which only
increase the spending by point one five percent which is a
very small which is small
it ' s only one ten percent of the error that every
year the government make on spending 
so so i would do that that in in uh definitely
the second thing i would do i i will uh uh definitely review
the whole tax system
i think that is a more uh more important issue
uh i i do not think the current tax system is fair and uh
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
or would you like uh graduate tax because
the tax system more or different company tax 
 uh uh more a more graduate and more grad uhm uhm
 
not to to progressive but but now i ' ll consider
it ' s slightly regressive at the upper end 
uhm people who earning uh five uh fifteen thousand per year per
month i ' m i ' m sorry fifteen thousand per per month and
someone who earn uh two hundred thousand per month is uh
pay the same rate
 and i i i i think there should be a slight
difference there 
i ' m not talking a big difference but i i do consider
 it ' s a slight difference
 and uh some element of improvement here in the
income tax should be should be there
and i also in in the in the profit tax the the problem right now
we we have is we we have uh uh uh uh the the profit tax slightly higher than
the average rate the standard rate for for the 
income tax so there ' s incentive for people in the upper end try to
shift the the the tax burden in order reduce the tax
i think there should be some some changes over there
 
 uh 
 uhm 
 per month five 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 income yeah 
 uhm 
uhm yeah 
 uhm uhm
