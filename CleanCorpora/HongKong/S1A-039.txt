<I>
 
so western are you playing at the ritz today 
yeah four o'clock till five forty-five
 
what are you going to play 
well i haven't really though about it yet
you know sometimes i just go in sit down look at the crowds and see
 what kind of crowd i have and then i just play whatever i like
 
so you take requests 
not if they don't give me a three hundred buck tip z ' s
unclear speech overlaps with a ' s laughter 
there was one time that there was this one guy 
actually only two weeks ago there was just one guy who came round to
me and he looked very pleased and he will he said he enjoyed my music very
much and he gave me a ten dollar tip
 
oh gee what an insult
what do you mean are you are you are you are are you i mean it
must be hotel policy that you are not supposed to take tips anyway 
yeah that ' s true
i don't i don't work for tips anyway but you know sometimes when
people really insist on giving me a tip even if it ' s ten dollars i still
give them a plain smile say thank you very much one-word
 
 
 i think if someone give me ten dollars as a tip for
playing music or am i just give back and say you must need this more than
than i do 
well i think you ' ll never know
these people will come back and they will see you again and you
don't want to offend them 
that ' s okay with me
it ' s part of the business
 
yes so and so 
in my opinion
 
yeah 
there was one time there was this one guy who gave me a five
dollar coin and asked me is there anywhere to put a tip
 
 huh gee 
 a few words 
oh uhm musicians get no respect 
well it ' s not true
there ' s some very nice people
it doesn't really matter very much to me
you know like if they give me a tip or not or if they give me big
tip or not
you know there are just some very nice inter interesting
people that i played for and
 
come on
you don't really feel that way 
i do sometimes
 
give me a break
they ' re just the audience
they don't know anything about music 
that ' s not true
 there was one time 
 
 they usually remarkably ignorant about music 
uhm they could be ignorant but they have ears
they hear
i mean they don't have to know what you play
they don't have to know know know whether you are brilliant in the
technique or not but they listen to you play and they enjoy it and just stay
and then they ' re listening some of them
 i thought 
 
 yeah i guess 
and actually sometimes you never know that there are
people who really know music
there was one time that there was this guy very good looking
guy sitting there with a ce cello right next to him
and it turned up he played in some international symphony orchestra
 
which one do you remember 
i don't remember
i only remember he was quite good looking
and there was another time that there was this woman who came up to
me and told that she really enjoyed my music 
i said thank you
and she said uh no i really i really mean it
i run some kind of a opera house in in london 
and i listen to lots of
 
 huh 
some kind of opera house in london 
uhm well uh yeah come on just leave it 
 
 are there are there many different kinds of opera
houses in london
is it like a like a old opera house or uh chinese opera house
what sort of opera house is it 
oh well just opera house okay 
uhm uh
 
i think she was pulling your leg 
no
 
no i don't really
so after all these see how many years has it been now
it ' s been a year and some months two years and some months
 since you you quit your job and and became a full-time
musician 
 yeah 
yeah
 
is it good
you glad you did it 
uh i think it was a very good decision 
i mean it was it ' s something that i always wanted to do but i
just never thought it was a wise thing to do because it seemed to me
that music wasn't a very secure job
it ' s still not secure you know i just go on the two
month 
 
 but you ' ve done quite well 
that ' s true
i ' ve been lucky to a very great extent
 
 uh 
of luck but you ' ve done quite well 
that ' s true
so i ' ll keep doing it and see how it goes
 
yeah 
i don't think i can ever go back to go back to a nine to five
job anymore
 
really 
i cannot imagine myself getting up at six o'clock
getting to the shower get dressed
dash off to the bus stop
squeeze into the bus with everybody else 
 
 how about a twelve to eight job instead 
a twelve to eight job is about the the hours that i ' m working
now
yeah i i work pretty flexible hours now and it ' s nice so i get
to play in different things
lots of time you know i get three different things
going on in one day 
so i can play in different places play for different people
 
 yeah 
it ' s nice 
yeah 
how about you
 
what do you mean by how about me 
well i thought you will wanting to get more playing jobs
apart from your part-time job 
 
 of course i do but a few words 
get jobs you get 
well that was last thing to play
 
i don't want to talk about it 
 was it that bad 
 
 do you want to 
i don't know i will never go back to play music full-time because
it ' s just i don't like to rely on the people that that run the music
business and the business involve
i don't i don't like personally find find it most of the business
had very little to do with what i think is beautiful about music
so i prefer to to you have to get the job and play 
for money but only for fun 
 do you 
but do you have to rely on these people to get your jobs
 
well almost invariably you do
the only i mean you have a very unique situation because you 
are a contractor and you you find what for others as well as yourself so you ' re
essentially you ' re the boss
uhm but i don't i don't i don't like to like to do that
 
 for people with no business skill like you
 
i really think that but i do not like to do that 
you have to be ripped off right
 
i could have been a business person but i just chose not
to 
 oh well just face the the fact you know
you ' re you ' re not one of those people with the with the
intelligence and the business skills
then just face the the truth and be ripped off
 
oh it ' s true i i i have standards and morality too high to
permit me to be a band leader like you 
yeah
 
you know another point is that you know there there these
trade-offs and and now although i haven't been like playing some of the
weirdest gigs in my life in hong kong i i still like to be able to choose and
when i play music for a living i had to take every job that came along
because i never knew when the next one will be even though i work for a while
it was you never know until it ' s going to dry up 
yeah
 
i mean you you you have very been been very lucky in sense of
having long term jobs with with hotels that that that keep you working for
six eight twelve months of a time
most musicians don't have that uh that kind of life style which
i i don't know i think it ' s it ' s good for you 
well yeah but that ' s that that comes back to what i ' ve said
earlier
i still find it pretty insecure
i mean long term what do you mean by long term is what six months
eight months twelve months
that ' s long term
 
for a musician that ' s very long term 
sometime like you in a symphony you know which is you know is
boring for a while 
 oh well 
yeah maybe i should start thinking about running in other fields
what do you think
i mean apart from my music business as a 
 
 i don't know 
i think you should you ' re so good at the music business and you
should continue and you 
 yeah i ' m not saying i ' m giving it up
i ' m i say maybe i should diversify get into some other business
like uhm tut selling nu skin products uh
 
no i think instead you should diversify within the music
profession 
what
 
for example a friend of mine in los angeles runs a well sort of a
a complete party business that includes music and other entertainment
and and you ' re experiencing you know organising things for the
hotels
you found magicians clowns and all sorts of silly things
but what my friend does is he he bills his product as as a sort
of a complete uh entertainment uhm business and he will he will throw a party
for you uhm for a appropriate compensation which includes food catering
entertainment uhm setting up and cleaning up the whole thing
he ' ll do the whole thing is completely integrated
and he just he ' s he ' s very very successful not only that he
always books his own bands for for you know for music for the entertainment
parts of the of of the parties and so you works a lot has a lot of fun and he ' s
he ' s he ' s doing quite well i mean you you can do something like that i i
don't know whether that ' s right for you but something like that is still
uses your talent and your contacts in music without having to get into a
completely new business 
yeah that might not be appropriate for hong kong though
i mean it i know it ' s an example but it it seems like hong kong
people met if when they entertain they would much rather rent a place and at
some nice hotel
all food prepared 
 
 i think the hotel does everything 
yeah
 
but even so the hotels then what do they do
they they give the the food and beverage manager who who runs
around and organises things like like food and entertainment and then
invariably calls someone like you to organise the music 
yeah
 
i mean if you if you if you got to be known by the food and
beverage managers and someone who could organise the whole thing then then
they would you ' ll just have more people working and and of course you ' d
make more 
i in fact to be doing some of the stuff at the moment but not
very regularly yet
it ' s too hard to get into some hotels because they ' ve already
got a particular agent or particular department in the hotel
handling that and because they ' re not willing to change to new new people
 
 sure 
well but you ' ve been quite successful in the last couple of
years gaining new accounts and that sort of thing and you haven't even hardly
tried it all you just sort of wherever you ' re playing you know you see if
they want somebody to do this stuff
and they say always say yes
seems like you ' re quite good at that stuff 
 well i ' ll do it and see see what happens 
i ' m i ' m not too old at the moment so i can afford
doing more work 
 
 try to do something like something like this 
 i don't know you are pretty old 
uh aw thank you
 
uhm definitely you know usually in your upper twenties 
yah i keep doing it for a while and see what happens
may be i don't want to do it after all
i ' ll give it a try for a matter a couple of years and then may be
i ' ll decide to go to acting or something
i ' m a good actor
 don't don't ever underestimate my acting 
 
i used to act a lot when i was at school
 
 be serious 
 yeah right 
acted like a student 
maybe
 
well so what ' s else is new 
uhm i might take up a new job
 
that ' s we we ' ve just talked about that
that ' s not new
what ' s new 
 uh 
new let ' s see
i have been probably working so hard
i don't think there is anything really new for the last week
or so 
 
 have you seen any good movies lately 
oh yeah
i saw that uhm what was it called
uh huh what was it called 
 
 must have been great
 you can hardly remember 
 yeah before i saw uhm four weddings and and a
funeral
 
did you like it 
uh it was quite funny
it was a little too long though
 
really 
yeah that ' s what i thought
 
i thought i saw i didn't like it quite well 
oh
 
i thought it was quite funny and sentimentally
appealing without being maudlin maudlin 
 yeah 
what
 
maudlin
m a u d l i n 
what does that mean
 
uh now you ' ve really asked me a difficult question
 uhm that means it ' s like that means is kind of like
 like too syr syrupy and sappy 
 well i see okay i i understand now 
oh so you are telling me that uhm you native english speakers
don't usually know what words mean when you say them
 
well uh you know what it means but giving a formal definition is
harder 
so what ' s sappy 
 
 sappy is is is uhm well is 
is is sentimental in a in a very uhm in a very base kind of way
you know sort of primitive sentimentali not primitive
sentimentality but but really overdone sentimentality 
 maudlin 
 okay okay you give me you tell part of the mo
 part of the movie which particularly gave you that feeling then
i ' ll relate that 
 
 no it didn't give me that feeling that ' s why i
like it 
uh o okay 
 
 it was sentimental but it wasn't maudlin or sappy
all right okay okay 
 
 i like it for that reason
and it was funny i mean i always like the way brits 
speak 
you know that they are very funny i mean that that for instance
the the toast the the toast at the weddings in this movie were hilarious
no american would ever say anything that funny i mean it is it is
very sort of uhm understated wit that i like
the americans are more brash you know just
they you know they are humour is more kind of in your face 
 but brit humour is very s very subtle
ours is probably not subtle on the other hand or probably you
know you know
every plumber in london probably says oh that old joke again but
for americans it ' s very is very funny 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 hah 
 yeah 
so what do you say when you propose a toast
 
uh well i actually i ha haven't do that in the 
weddings and uh one time i completely forgot i that i had to do that i
was the best man and it didn't occur to me uh i should have a toast prepared
and so uhm all the sudden i mean it was a big giant reception and
all these people were standing around and and there ' s going to be a toast
that i ' m standing there with some friends talking where we were quiet and
trying to be you know uh not not be loud so so people giving the toast
wouldn't be a problem uh for them
and i ' m standing there in this crowd and all of a sudden the
groom comes up and says excuse frank are got a toast to make here
it was very humiliating and that toast was a complete disaster
 i mean 
 oh uh 
 what did you say 
 
well i was first of all i hadn't thought about this at all so i
didn't make it well the toast in like ten seconds
so of course as you know said how much we all care for the bride
and groom and how happy we are for them and you know we should drink to their
health and all this stupid things that you always say 
 but i mean if i had time to think about i would have talked about
how you know first met paul who was the sex offenders uh rehabilitation
programme he ' s come a long way since then and that you know now he ' s got
his drinking problem you know under controli i am sure he will make a good
you know uhm uh uh good husband if not parent
we still worry about that
and their marriage will set on like that would people
would enjoy that laugh
you know that it was a complete disaster
and the only thing that everyone was talking about that was how
the the best man forgot to deliver a toast 
 oh what ' s 
 yah 
that ' s quite funny
its ' uhm i think most for the time these things are only funny
for the people who who know the the couple
you know for people like me say i go i go play in a wedding uh it ' s
one of the most boring jobs
 
then how about how about chinese weddings
do you have like do you have like a a a best man give a toast or
anything like that 
uh let ' s see
they have the invited guests to go up to the stage with the newly
weds and talk about what great people they are and how lovely the are and
everything
 
rarely make fun of them and 
yes well yes some oh yeah when you go to those chinese
banquet in the evening sometimes they have all these wild games
it de it depends on the crowd but i think most of the
younger younger people now they would go into this stupid game of uhm
teasing the the bride and bridegroom
like you know asking the girl to wear some kind of a grape in
front of her of her of her chest and ask the bridegroom to go pick up the
grape in front of her chest and something like that
 
really 
yeah
and there ' s even there more other games that ' s really funny
they al always pick up pieces from the chicken dish dish
 from the night
 they will pick the head
 
 uh huh 
yeah 
one of the wings
uhm a piece of chicken breast
a drum stick and the tail the butt of the of the chicken
 
i think tail was 
and then they will put everything in the on the plate and
blindfold the bride no blindfold the bridegroom to ask him to pick
one piece from the dish
whatever piece he ends up picking he has to kiss that part of the
bride 
so let ' s say if he ch if he pick up the
chicken head then he will have to kiss the bride ' s head somewhere
 
 uhm 
on the beak 
uh yeah
and if it ' s the tail then who knows where
 
i guess everybody know that ' s her tongue
well so that ' s uhm that ' s sound interesting 
well that ' s interesting for the people but uhm when you go
play in a in a function like that 
 
 oh yeah it should be boring for you just sit 
 there and watch 
 you have to sit there and watch all
this 
 
 see that for a hundred times 
yeah and when you are sitting on stage trying to look very
pleasant and very very very please and everything when they talk about how
they met each other in uh you know like five years ago and how they how they
uh you know start to like each other a lot more and the last five 
years oh 
 
 oh they go through all of that 
yes
 
uhm 
sometime they even show you pictures of the of the couple
when they are kids
 
yeah i guess is see this is this is what i consider kind kind it
is really over the top
i mean i ' ve been to weddings in the states that have been like
this i went to this one wedding i i was not the best man or usher of this
wedding day
and hah they had this horrible thing
they had in the middle of the ceremony they had a a tenor and a
soprano singing this duet from the west side story musical
it was the one uhm where they uhm make up our hand one 
hand that sort of thing two-words our hands one
hand
yeah a one hand is already one hand but anyway it was it was
really uh uh i almost had to throw up
it was quite awful 
 uh yeah yeah yeah 
because they sing so badly
 
no they sing wonderfully but were so sappy and uh maudlin and
wasn't it
you know i mean they are getting married already it was going to
incline the cry be sentimental as are already doing it
and then they sing this really moving love song from this sort of
you know remake of romeo and juliet
and so anybody who is at all inclined to blubbering and 
one-word and a few words is awful
it ' s to me that it ' s over the top
i mean it ' s kind of like if you watch a a bad television show
you get the the same sort of you know they push all the right buttons
lots of this work 
yeah most people make it too much like a sometime of a show
now
you know hav having wedding parties and stuff
 
yeah 
it ' s like they have they have they are obliged to entertain
everybody 
but it ' s okay
if i get the job i ' ll still do it
yeah 
 
western have you ever driven a car 
as a matter of fact yes i i have
i i drove illegally
 
when 
when i i was in holiday in vancouver a friend of
mine brought me over to one of these empty parking lots and
i had some illegal driving lessons
it was good fun
i i loved it
it was very easy
i had a an automatic
 
 yeah 
 oh yeah 
oh it ' s automatic 
yeah so it was just like you know put
 
just steer it 
turn it on and just steer
yeah but an another time i was given a standard or how to
call it
 
that ' s manual sort 
 yeah and it was very hard
i just couldn't i couldn't keep my hands and my feet to
co-ordinate
and i was so i was so nervous you know
my friend kept telling me lif lift your foot up half-way
and then and the uhm
how do you call it i don't remember
you know the clutch should not stop you know you have
to you have to move your hand and lift your foot at the same time but not all
of your foot only half-way up
 
 oh yeah 
all right 
and then i just i got so uh so tense that i could hardly do
it
 
i think it it ' s hard to learn how to drive when you ' re you ' re
not a kid 
i ' m very young by the way
 
you are 
yeah
 
okay 
i ' m only twelve
 
i see 
yeah
 
well so uhm the uh the thing is in the states everybody drives
when they are really young and 
like how old
 
well i think i was driving by the time i was fourteen
 not legally but you know the parents like take you out
see everyone there has a car
everyone in the states have a car
even very poor families have cars compared to here like only one
to twenty fam twenty people have car here 
 really 
uhm
 
such a different 
and there ' s nowhere to drive here
 
no place to park a few words 
yeah there are proper places for you to park if you pay three
thousand dollars a a month to rent a little place for your
car
 
 yeah 
yeah i heard in the paper last year that there was a parking
space for sale in the middle in the mid-levels
it went with the flat and not all the flats have parking spaces
if you want one with with a flat they will cost you something
like a million dollars hong kong
and uh for the for the parking space paid 
and cos it was saying in the south china morning post they were
saying the the the cost of a of a parking space in mid-levels will buy you a
really nice house in australia 
 just for the park lot 
oh i ' m sure
and the other day i was reading some magazine and they were
interviewing this uh japanese violinist 
she now she has got a house in australia and she said the house
that the rent that she ' s paying no how did it go
the money that she spent on the house in australia can only afford
one third of her flat in hong kong
 
 wow that ' s crazy 
yeah
well kitten you ' d better move on and don't disturb us here
 
so your cat is very noisy 
well they have been hiding for most of the day while i was
teaching
 
oh yeah 
for the b the boy is okay
the boy is more friendly more adventurous not uhm likes meeting up
with new people and all that stuff
uhm you kept yourself very busy
playing with the kids whereas the girl was hiding most of the time
and she hissed at th the kid when he tried to look where
she was
 
really 
yah
she was very timid and trying to act as a lion if
you try to approach
 
 yeah 
so how was your piano teaching today 
it was okay
yeah i struggled through long day
i started at nine forty-five and finished off at one thirty almost
two o'clock
 
how many students did you have 
i taught five today
 
wow that ' s a lot 
yeah five in all
yeah it would be a lot easier if they had practiced more
you know they just came in and they are honest with you told you i
haven't practiced
why
well we were watching tv till very late last night
and they kept yawning and dozing off all morning 
ah yeah it ' s teaching is is so hard especially teaching music you
know it ' s not like teaching uhm say english you know that some kind of a
rule that you can you can go by
and and yeah thing like spelling you can just force yourself to
memorise
 
uh huh 
you know with with music that you if kids are not really into
it or enough talented it ' s so hard
 
yeah i know what you mean 
you want to kill them all
so far i ' ve been i ' ve been uhm controlling myself pretty well
i haven't killed them yet
 
yeah well that ' s probably a good thing
i think you ' re your a few words bodies 
no i ' ll probably be doing it like all those crazy guys and
crazy women
put them in the bath tub and deep-fry the bodies first
 did you read that news
 
 yeah 
yah i did 
yes that was one woman
i think she she killed her husband
she put the husband in the bath tub
 
yah 
and then poured boiling oil over the body
 
she must have used a lot of boiling oil 
well i don't know how she did it
she might have cut it cut the body up 
 
 well let ' s not talk about this 
let ' s talk about something else
it ' s too one-word 
no there are all that always crazy people in hong kong these
days
 
kept worrying the world i think 
 yeah 
the other day i was playing at pacific place and there was this
little old woman maybe fifty years old
she came over to me i was playing some song
and she said okay i ' ll sing along but she started singing a
different song
 
oh great 
uh so when i was playing one song she was singing another
song
 
perfect 
and then i finished and she said oh you ' ve finished okay let ' s
sing another one
and i start play one song and she started singing another song
again
 
jesus
it ' s brilliant 
yeah crazy people
 
i find myself going to pacific place probably to eat i
don't know why 
 yeah they ' ve they ' ve got lots very nice
restaurants there
a nice combination
 
yeah i visit whenever i have guests come from out of town i ' ll
take them to the the is it the funan garden sichuan garden 
 it ' s the peking garden 
 
peking garden right

yeah

and that stuff
 
well i have not
i haven't done so
i have not ordered peking duck 
well yeah usually come in a whole duck and they will
demonstrate how they cut the skin off from the duck 
and then they get little pieces of uhm sort of pancake 
or crepes what do you call it to wrap up the duck to eat with
 
 uh huh 
 yeah 
do you eat the skin 
yeah
 
really 
yeah it ' s hugely fat
 
hugely fat wow

i don't eat that very much myself
i found it just too greasy yeah
 
 too greasy
