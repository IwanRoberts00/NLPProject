 
""
stan thanks very much for coming along with this morning
""
it  ' s great to see you
""
thank you very much indeed 
""
""
oh i  ' m happy to meet you kingsley
 
""
uhm i would
""
the reason i ask you to come along was because i just join the uh
senior common room committee the scr committee
""
and as you know i got uhm  i got a meeting with them later this
week to discuss the business plan
""
so i thought i may talk to you about it first and then uh you could
 fill  me about some of the  the details some of the developments
that  ' s been going on uh in in in the last year or so
""
uhm maybe you could just give me an idea stan
""
what  ' s what  ' s the general picture like at the moment about the
the finances and so on of of the scr 
""
""
well the uh the finance situation in scr is not  doing too
well honestly
""
uh ever since well you know hong kong having uh a depression for
last few years and then you had incident of the uh nine one one incident and
that really uh psychologically withdraw a lot of people from from us too and
then later on i mean for the last few months sars problem which business down
around forty percent     uh which is not too bad in comparing
with other   one word  outlet though they down about
sixty seventy eighty percent as you   can  see on tv or read on
newspaper    
""
so we are struggling in in that sense we are   
""
yes 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
so how about the uh how about the profit uh profit or loss 
situation uh
""
what  ' s the general picture being in the last few years and as far
as uh  showing the  pro  profit
""
are you supposed to be  a profit making organization or or 
as the philosophy changes there so it was it  ' s originally a non profit
organization and it  ' s now become a profit making organization or maybe you
can give me a little background uh   about  that 
""
""
 right  
""
yeah
""
that  ' s a very good question kingsley
""
uh we are not we are a non profit organization in in in in that
sense but we do want to have a balanced budget because don't forget we are uh
financially independent 
""
we have a subvention from university and you know with no rent pay
and other maintenance help and all that
""
but uh real  moneyize  we need to have pure some kind of
reserve     for whatever happen like in running a  f& s
 busi   you do need that kind of reserve because for example of
sudden a major equipment breakdown    and  that is a major
cost    
""
and no one could help you so we have to dig it out from the reserve
""
so if you look at the back of one of the pages uh
 
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
of the business report 
""
""
of the business report
""
  that  ' s  it show uh uh the last twelve years i  ' ve
been here uh eight years we are making some money and put in the reserve
""
that  ' s why the reserve build up by one point some million dollars
as up today    
""
but these four years including last two years we  ' ve been having a
difficult time
""
  that means  we were in the red    
okay including this year and  probable  the year to come
 
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
uh but you still have a reserve of over million of hong kong
dollars   is that right  
""
""
 yes we do  
""
yes we do
 
""
so the general picture is i guess that uhm until about the the
asia turndown which is ninety eight then the scr was doing okay basically
""
""
""
uh you can say that   yeah  you can say that 
 yeah 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 so   it  ' s really since ninety  since  the
last four years or so but uhm since uhm since we go into uh  to uh lost
 anything  period 
""
""
well uh if you want to dig out this chart    
""
the actual surplus deficits the budget for the last twelve years
""
uh  in even in year two thousand and nineteen ninety nine we  ' re
making money
""
  we  have a a a reserve left   okay 
""
uh just last year and this year     and would last
year was like point eight thousand and two hundred eighty thousand deficit
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
two hundred eighty   thousand 
""
right 
""
""
 right  
""
this year would pretty well expect the same
""
a little bit less because the last few months were pretty awful
because the sars problem
 
""
right  yeah
""
how what what how  ' s the membership uh developed over the over the
last uh few years
""
how many how many members do we have in the uh senior common room
these days 
""
""
well we have over thousand and 
""
honestly uh  we  in my business plan it mention that in uh
year nineteen ninety seven there were twelve hundred and twelve members 
  
""
and today in two o o year two o o three that  ' s eleven and forty
""
  so  there  ' s a slight drop   of  the
membership
 
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
and the majority those members are  uh academic majority was
our teachers or other all kinds of other people as well as administrators and
uh an office staff and uh  staff 
""
what what what  ' s the background of the membership 
""
""
well you are really you are really uh stated that the most
them uh
""
the members  consil  of uhm  i mean sorry consist of
different type uh of senior staff     means professors lector
doctor high administrator office people well   people  of high
rank and contractual staff along they are involve teaching and  in in
university certain grade and above   they  they entitle to
become our   member 
""
of course in last few year we also open up membership for like
 one word  membership alumni membership and also 
one word  membership   which is  non academic staff
membership we give them a quota   which  in
""
we try to expand the membership that  ' s why we include of them 
 we  ' re not  supposed to but we did anyway    
""
yeah
 
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
so uh  yeah so  ex 
""
so maybe uh seventy percent academics and thirty percent the rest
 percent  
""
""
true  one word 
 
""
yeah i see right
""
so stan what are the main what are the main points that i should
uh
""
what are the main points i should uh look at and uh and take
notice of your business plan this year 
""
""
okay for this year uh there  ' s two major area we should look
at
""
one is cost saving    
""
cost saving means uh  the manager would work closely with the uh
 with my left and right hand that means the bar captain and the chef
""
  both  twos are the one who order from the supply
  okay 
""
we have i have to monitor closely   that  we are
getting stuff they  ' re value of money    
""
okay or a very good price    so  in a long run
that would save that that means cost saving because   we 
getting thing cheaper     than what it is now
""
  of  course then you need a lot of pushing and a lot
of convincing   to  the supplies and all that
""
so that  ' s saving right that
""
and also the major problem as i consulted with other counters in
the business
""
when they look at the uh countering statement they just said wah
you know 
""
in the year time the uh the volume of business okay  
  is over ten million dollars   okay  in the year
time    
""
but the uh staff cost is seventy percent    
""
seventy percent   believe  it or not
""
i mean if you take that out in any other  one word
 in hong kong no way they could run it   like that 
""
but because we do have subsidy or uh subvention from university
and its rent free and other maintenance we we get it from nothing  
from   uni  university like a lot of help from university to
support us
""
but still the major  the major problem lies on the staff cost
    which in a way i  ' m kind of happy because  kind of
happy not  hap  personally i  ' m not because i get my salary cut like
most of people because as you know the university pays scale is linked with
government   civil  servants   pays  scale
and we have a six percent cut in the next two years
""
  three  percent this year and three percent for
the year to come     which help to do i mean which help
the scr because   that  ' s  cost saving right there
""
and uh i did suggest to the committee last year in my last
business plan and 
""
at that we should really look at the staff cost and like 
three words  institute in hong kong university in other independent
uh department
""
they  three words  especially they ask they
request or they submit a ten percent staff cost cut    
""
okay because they were not doing too good themselves a year ago
two years ago   uh 
 
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 what   place is this sorry 
""
""
 three words  institute
 
""
what is it    one word   
""
""
 it  ' s   some kind it  ' s something like space
 
""
oh i see   alright  
""
""
 yeah   yeah
 
""
yeah 
""
""
and  they pretty well run the same way as we are
""
they are   financial  independent   they
 got some support from university    
""
and they they had the ten percent salary cut    
and they request that wah the cost the uh  the committee    or
their  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 what they   teach in their institute 
""
""
i have no idea   not not  i i don't want to give
wrong wrong wrong   information  so i  ' m not sure
""
but uh it  ' s very much like   space okay 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 i see  
""
well teaching extra  one word  courses  
 or or  questionnaire yeah  
""
""
 something like that and they have ask for   ten
percent cut so   in order  to balance the budget you  
know 
""
so you can see that
""
for example if i tell people which i have told many time to other
people friends of my in the industry that i pay right now the scr  ' s pay not
i pay sorry
""
scr pay eleven thousand a month for a cleaner   and 
they  fee out 
""
  as  a university graduate even  nowaday  in
hong kong don't get that kind of salary    
""
some of them may  otherwise     
""
okay so you can see the difficult  the how difficult it is to
run   the  scr would have a balanced budget
""
  that  ' s all   the time now   you 
see the present time
""
and uh so i mention the cost cutting so this is it
""
two major area is the staff cost and of course cut down the cost
of supply  and say  we would be   would be  order
stuff
""
we try to be  very  careful   we get  very
little money so that  ' s   two  issue we have to look at 
  
""
on the other side there also uh uh  we have to think a way of
increasing business   okay 
""
so i have some new services here hopefully to increase business of
the scr in future    
""
for example we do have to spend a bit of money in modifying the
snooker room which is  hardly used
""
  it  ' s  a beautiful space and i suggest to turn
it to a cyber cafe     but it was kind of turndown
""
and now we have a proposal to change the big seminar room 
 which  i think it might work   with  a rental fee
of course
""
  and  then we provide  one word
   service there 
""
so but that cost  would  maybe uh two hundred thousand
dollars so whether the committee will approve it or not does in the future
but the suggestions there    
""
also we should think of some new services
""
for example something to attract the member to come back and use
it more frequent    
""
uh for example the noodle bar   which is  a a
fresh noodle bar we call that means in the canteen from monday to friday we
would do a fresh noodle bar with the choice of uh ingredient for mere twenty
five dollar with a big bowl     which is i done a research
around which for  qualitize  and  priceize  would be 
   the the thing to buy     you know
""
because it  ' s fresh   and  you have a great choice
and   it  ' s  only twenty five dollar would feed you well so
  as  one   lunch 
""
okay and  everything is set up there it  ' s been   out
""
 
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 so   that noodle bar is  opened  at
lunch time only   or  
""
""
 lunch   time only   yeah yeah 
""
everything is set up like the uh the stove been built and the uh
air conditioning uh at that point at that  the first tape ends 
 
""
 i see right  
""
uhm  what  ' s make you think it  ' s going to make a profit
""
 are you sure  if people is choosing to buy noodles at
twenty five dollars a meal   then   one word 
and you only serving at lunch time then they may not buy the other lunch from
you but you make the better profit or not 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uh yes or no
""
but the the noodle bar have a better profit margin than other
dishes you know
""
  and  it  ' s easy to make and the  one word
 hardly end of wastage
""
  it  ' s  not like cooking up a chinese dish or stream
fish for example
""
  let  ' s  say we we we have twenty uh fresh fish to
be served stream fish today     and we only serve fifteen
""
  the  other five pretty well wasted   for
 the uh  subs   one word    merely
""
""
but for the fresh noodle bar we can use it again tomorrow without
any kind of bad effect okay
""
and the profit margin is much higher than selling fish and other
sea food other dishes the chinese dishes
 
""
 and  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
right 
""
""
yes
 
""
so what kind of noodles are you selling now 
""
""
we would have uh  we probably have uh three different kind
of noodle like the  oily  noodle the wonton noodle and  one
word      and also ingredient choice in noodle
would be like fish ball and uh  uh shrimp   dumping  and beef
ball and  and  wanton  wonton    
""
what do we call yeah so people have a choice
""
  they  can have just a bowl wonton noodle  
or  they can have uh noodle with three different kind of ingredient
""
all for the same price     and it  ' s fresh you
know   people  can see  see them being made right in front of
you   so  people like the idea you know
""
it  ' s like the fresh pass the bar in the bar area we serve every
friday night
""
we prove it to be very successful    yeah 
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 right
""
i   think it  ' s going to be three sort of information
""
one was the uh converting uh snooker   room 
""
second was uh doing the noodle bar     and third
one 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
and the third one we  ' re go uh we we
""
this is we go to try uh delivery service    
within campus only     and a take out menu so people can
download from the website and   send  us a fax and   
pick  up order
""
and when they arrive the order is there     for
them to pick up  within  it  ' s fast and convenience   
""
""
aiming at the present time university staff especially academic
staff are getting busier   and  they had more work to do
""
so they had less time for you know for leisure lunch or sit there
  for  forty five minutes an hour to have   lunch 
like they have before    
""
instead a lot of people told us and the staff like the staff and
myself that they they they get very busy   and  they need to
have lunch
""
  a lot  of them bring their own lunch to save the
uh you know coming up and order it
""
  but  if you can provide a fast service of food
  and  good food of course and they will come up and pick it
up you know
""
and also delivery service  are cost  a minimum to it and we
will deliver a certain given kind   to  other depart to any
department or members of staff     within a campus 
   okay
""
  that  will save that be time saving for them
    and also a group of people in the office would have we
would have a new item like the rice box   in chinese  
faahn hahp   this refers to a lunch box 
""
  uh  lot of people love that uh you know uh would
would love to have something like that for lunch    
""
so uh we will provide that in the near future once it is approved
by the committee
""
then we will have  faahn hahp   this refers to a
lunch box  or rice box to deliver to different department   or
 you know i can when i say department means because one person cannot
order and have a staff a staff of mine to walk like to   twenty
minutes  to deliver one rice box so that  ' s  that  ' s  
need a minimum  yeah 
""
well  that  ' s hundred and fifty dollars
 
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 one  
""
 so may need two three people or something like 
""
""
yeah some i see   hundred  and fifty dollars more
   one word   more order 
""
""
 exactly  
""
 yeah  
""
probably around ten orders
 
""
oh i   see  
""
""
 so   a department group ten people very easy for
lunch and they can fax even beforehand what kind of ingredient they want and
we  ' ll deliver it on time    
""
so to save them a trip to go outside   or  taking a
taxi for dim sum elsewhere   in  uh western district you know
""
of course providing them we are giving really uh good rice box and
of the rice itself   and  the container   and  the
ingredients also have been fresh and nice   yeah 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
does it mean you go to employ new staff to do this or could you
get  two words  staff
