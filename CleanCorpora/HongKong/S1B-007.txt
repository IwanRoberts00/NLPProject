<I>
uh so uh you are aware that some some people uh from
english department to find those do some recording here so uh just keep quiet
and you are uh don't make too much noise uh we ' ll one-word
uh today we shall introduce the so call uh three dimensional
conservation equations 
now uh now this is the equation uh governing the fluid 
frozen later on uh we shall use this equation to investigate the
growth uh using these three equations
and uh you can see that this equation is derived from uh law of
conservation of mass one-word and energy
uh in your first year you might already uh come across this equation
but it ' s in one dimensional form but this year we shall look at it from a
three dimensional uh approach because generally speaking all the fluid motion
are three dimensional
so we look at it from a general point of view and then later on we ' ll
simplify this equation into two dimensional one dimensional and we apply this
equation equations to some particular case 
okay let ' s uh start with this uh continuity equation first
uh continuity equation is actually the law of conversation of mass
and to derive this let ' s look at this cubical elements delta x delta y and
delta e z and let ' s consider the mass struck entering the six surfaces of
its in it one-word element
now uh on this surface on the y e z plane look at this uh delta y
and delta e z
the mass struck entering this is equal to density times the
velocity times the area okay
this is the mass struck entering and the mass struck leaving this
 uh the opposite surface are parallel distance delta x is equal to
 the original where your road u plus a great of change of this road q
which we write because it ' s just in the x direction so so be around road u
round x times delta x
now this represent the increment if you cancel out delta x the
delta x it means that this is the original road u plus a increment of delta
increment of road u
so this is the value at this side and then uh we have to multiply
this by the area delta e z delta y
so this is the mass of entering mass struck leaving here
and so that uh like all the six surfaces the mass struck
entering this q uh delta x delta y delta e z these it more critical element
should be road u delta what y delta e z and road v
v is the component in the of the velocity in the vertical direction
or in the y direction
we write v to represent the velocity in the y direction
and then there is a similarly there is a value of w velocity
component in the e z direction 
so uh these three term add up is the mass entering it ' s cubical
element while the mass leaving this cubical element is the original value
times the great of change of this along their distance so uh we have these
three add up is the mass leaving the mass leaving uh the element 
so the mass entering and the mass leaving should be there will be a
net value the net value is of course is equal to the mass leaving the
element 
the net value is equal to the mass leaving and minus the mass
entering which uh should be equal to this value
now so there is a incre if there is an increase on
mass in the element the the volume of the element cannot change it must
be delta x delta y delta e z
so if there is an increase in mass in the element there must be a
increase in density of the element density the element will be heavier and
heavier with time
because if what flows in and what goes out are not balance there
must be an increase inside is that right
the increase can only take place with an increase of density of the
mass inside the element
so this is a round road road is the density
round road round t is the uh increase of density or increase of
mass and this increase of density times the volume is the increase of mass
inside the element
so we can now write the equation cancel out all the terms the
result is round road round t plus round road u round x plus round road u
round road v round y plus round road w round z is equal to zero and this
is known as the known as the continuity equation or this represent the
law of conservation of mass 
now this is a scatter form uh of writing out this equation
in the cartesian coordinate
now in ve very often in literatures we do not need not
like to write this in a very complicated manner so we use the rector 
symbol or the tenser symbol uh 
in the rector symbol now this is written as the dot
product of this dell operator and the velocity rector v okay
so uh don't be scare by this symbol because it just try to help you
to write the equation in a simpler manner 
or in tenser location you write the equation in term of
round x the sub k and you you sub k where this represent
that they had the velocity in the x y e z directions okay
so again is either the tenser location or the rector
 location you can regard it as just a kind of symbols mathematical symbol
so as to simplify the equation or you can write it uh very easily literature
when we are going to express the same thing and in when you
learn you your the mathematics you know that the the symbol of this dell
operator is actually go to the i j k rector times the re 
respective one-word while the velocity component 
rector as uh also the i j k rector of u v w
so the dot product of this is exactly the exactly this uh
continuity equation 
and sometimes you may also write the dot product call the 
automatic call it divergence of this uh one-word 
 rector v okay
so anyway uh no matter where you see this equation uh you see
either a complicated equation or this simplified form it just represent the
same thing law of conversation of mass okay
so uh this is the equation of law of conversation of mass uh which
 the density is included in the in the one-word 
so this means that uh the flow may be compressible or
incompressible
the equation will be true either the density changes or not 
for the case of incompressible flow where the density do does not
change uh you know what is the situation most of the flow density is
remaining constant
most of the fluid flow we ' re study the density is constant unless
its velocity very very high as high as greater than mark number point three
otherwise we treat the flow as what incompressible
don't don't just say if you ' re looking at gas and then you think
that gas is compressible so the flow is compressible
this is wrong okay because what
only when the velocity is reaching mark point three then the effect
of compressibility is getting important and mark point three is what value
the velocity of sound is what around three hundred and thirty meter
per second so point three is one hundred meter per second
and one hundred meter per second is around what three hundred and
sixty kilometer per hour
so even the highest speed train travel at the speed less than that
isn't it
it ' s only when you ' re talking about aircraft the movement of
aircraft missile that the effect of compressibility is important
so most of the fluid flow we study including gas or liquid
liquid is of course incompressible for most situation
so the fluid flow as incompressible so the equation actually we do
not need to include this density in because density now become a constant
this means that in the cubical element it can there cannot be
increase in mass so the result is what flows in must be equal to what flows
out okay
so the this become the volume flow rate entering the control volume
is equal to the volume flow rate leaving
so let ' s eliminate the density from the equation so we eliminate
the density because take out and from the from the one-word
 
so you can neglect this value and for most of the flow we ' re
studying uh we can look at it from the two dimensional point of view
because very often the end effect is just a small proportion of the
situation so to simplify the equation again we should assume that for most
flow situation there will be no valuation in the e z direction
so we leave we again eliminate distance uh w and then now the
equation is the two d equation or two dimensional equation is just round u
round x plus round v round y is equal to zero
so this is the equation which we shall encounter most often
it ' s just two dimensional that is only variation in the x and y
direction okay
so uh any equation or any velocity if it satisfy this
continuity equation when it substitute into the equations and to make the
 one-word or the one-word 
differentiation
we found that the result must be zero
if it ' s not zero this means that is wrong okay
this is the first criteria that we must satisfy of any pro 
okay
what flows in must equal to what flows out
and in your year one you usually use it in a pipes which is one
dimensional that is to say what entering the pipe must be equal to what
leaving the pipe this is only one dimensional okay 
so but this year we shall study mostly in the two dimensional
approach a long pause 
now and it is possible to absorb this equation by
introducing a function call a scale function call sine a greek letter sine uh
where if we define the velocity in the u component or in the x component as
round sine round y and the velocity in the y component as round sine negative
round sine round x or this is the definition of sine okay
if we define this that way you substitute u and v into the
continuity equation if you substitute in you just find out that result
you can cancel out the two terms and the result is zero okay
is that clear
you uh because u is equal the continuity equation is round u round
x plus round v round y equal to zero so you substitute here into that is
round what round u
u is round sine round y and then v is negative round round
sine round x
so this is the same so that ' s equal to zero this means that the
definition of this scale formality just give out the result equal to zero
which of course satisfy the continuity equation
so if there exist a function of sine we we call this sine dream
functions
later on i ' ll give a name call dream function because it represent
the dream line of the flow okay
so uh if you it we call this dream function if there exist such a
dream function uh defined that way then uh the result will satisfy the
continuity equation uh as we have shown here 
now uh we have introduced the equation in uh cartesian coordinate
of delta x delta y and delta e z
of course it is it they possible to derive the equation in a
cylindrical coordinate of r one- word and e z component
okay
why we need cylindrical coordinate why
anyone know
 a circular plan
yeah because many of the flow are pipes flow uh of cylindrical
shape so if we can have the system in cylindrical coordinate uh when reduce
the equations we will get a better or easier resolutions
so in cylindrical coordinate it ' s possible to draw these elements
into uh in cylindrical coordinate of r delta one-word 
and then delta r and delta e z and then again you obtain a mass balance of
 of mass conversation of mass over this element
uh uh we ' re not going into that because uh it takes uh it mean
the same meaning and it take some time
in fact uh the the diverge dell dot v this operator in
mathematics they can have some sort of transformations so it doesn't matter
whether it ' s cartesian coordinate or cylindrical coordinate or even
cylindrical coordinate
it ' s uh you ' ll look up some mathematical table they have a
equivalent transformation okay
so in rector symbols is this one but in different
coordinate they have different equation that can be found in many
mathematical cable of this dell dot v
the dot product of this uh gradient operator and the velocity
 rector okay
so it just take different form the physical meaning is exactly the
same is just uh the continuity equation and occur also in incompressible
flow we we do not need the the density term 
and also it ' s easy to reduce this equation into two
dimensional or one dimensional it ' s for example if there is no variation of
the velocity in the one-word direction
so this means that round something round one-word
 is zero if there is no variation in the radial direction or r
direction
this means that uh round v round r is zero
no variation one-word round something round
 the uh this is if there is no variation
so it ' s you can also reduce it into simpler form but the
dream functions for this cylindrical coordinates uh may take different
forms because that depend on whether the flow is axial symmetric uh if it ' s
axial symmetric means it is sym symmetrical above the e z axis okay
so if we have a circular body of this shape and the flow is x will
be the same uh along this axis so there will be no vary no variation in the
 one-word direction
so it ' s symmetry symmetrical above this x uh e z x axis while
in two dimensional flow it might be written in polar coordinates uh where
there is no variation in the e z direction
