mr deputy president  ships leaving hong kong have been

mr deputy president  since the government has in the past
been unable  al  to allocate adequate resources  to implement
certain promised social welfare projects  will the administration inform
this council of the following
""
a  what measures and steps will be taken in the future to ensure
that adequate provisions are made available for the timely implementation of
social welfare policies promulgated in the white paper
""
and b  how to ensure that the interim targets outlined in the
white paper on social welfare into the nineties and beyond for various
services will be accomplished by nineteen ninety-five ninety-six as promised
 speech-by-deputy-president 
""
""
mr deputy president  i shall answer the two-part question
seriatim  
""
as announced by the governor in his address to this council  on
seventh of october  the current expenditure on social welfare will be
increased  by twenty-six per cent  in real terms between now  and
nineteen ninety-seven 
""
there will be an immediate capital injection  of two point three
billion dollars  into the lotteries fund for the secure funding of a major
improvement in our welfare services between now and nineteen ninety-seven 
""
this capital injection will ensure adequate provision for the
timely implementation of all the major social welfare targets  set out in
the white paper on social welfare for the years from nineteen ninety-three
ninety-four to ninety-six ninety-seven 
""
this arrangement will not preclude government  from allocating
additional resources  for implementing other social welfare policies in
future 
""
government will provide the necessary resources  to ensure that
the interim targets as outlined  in the white paper on social welfare 
will be implemented as scheduled 
""
as mentioned earlier  funding has already been secured  for
meeting the key targets not only for the year nineteen ninety-five ninety-six
 but for the period up to ninety-six ninety-seven 
speech-by-deputy-president 
""
""
could the secretary inform this council how projects  which
are not covered by the social welfare white paper but have already been
approved by government  and have hitherto not been allocated funds for
their implementation  are to be funded  speech-by-deputy-president 
""
""
mr deputy president  the package announced this year in the
governor  ' s policy address  will ensure  a twenty-six per cent increase
in real terms  in social welfare funding from now until ninety-six
ninety-seven 
""
the real increase for next year for example is seven point six per
cent 
""
substantial amount of new money is thus assured every year in the
period  up to ninety-six ninety-seven 
""
the administration  ' s top priority is to meet key targets  in
the white paper 
""
funding for other improvement measures will be justified  and
funds will be sought  through the resource allocation exercise  in the
normal way   several-speeches 
""
""
mr deputy president  uh indeed  the growth of
expenditure for next year does not only cater to two teams  of social
outreaching work  but an additional four outreaching social work teams for
next year  rising to a total of thirty teams  by ninety-five
ninety-four ninety-five  that is the entire white paper target provision
 member's-question 
""
""
mr deputy president  i think time does not stand still 
""
the provision of social services will have to move with the times
if there is a genuine need to meet service uh in  pa  a particular
area 
""
the  provision of services in new towns for particular groups of
people will have to be reasoned  and if there is a genuine case  i will
seek the necessary advice from the necessary advisory committees before
implementing  member's-question 
""
""
uh mr deputy uh president i think there is a slight
misunderstanding here
""
in the past the lotteries fund was chiefly used for capital  uh
expenditure but the  special injection of funds of two point three billion
dollars into the lotteries fund  uh will be mainly used for recurrent 
with  associated capital expenditure 
""
i hope i have clarified that  speech-by-deputy president 
""
""
uh mr deputy president  i think the lotteries fund
injection is a one-off capital injection  and against this one-off capital
injection is both the capital element and also uh uh uh element of uh
recurrent expenditure for a large number of uh uh increase in services
""
there  ' s still some uncertainty involved in this capital injection
uh could take in account inflation and other costs that may be changing over
time 
""
can the government uh inform this council whether it is uh
determined uh to consider other measure to boast the  capa  uh the
lotteries fund should it prove that it  ' s inadequate to meet the full targets
of the uh social welfare white paper  speech of the deputy president 
""
""
uh mr deputy president  the basis for the two point three
billion dollar injection into the lotteries fund includes one point six
billion for a new  s  direct services  and zero point seven billion
 for other services currently funded from general revenue  so as to
relieve funds to meet in part the social security payments 
""
the capital injection may appear indeed to be much higher  than
the increase in recurrent spending 
""
this is because the capital injection required has been derived on
the basis of assessed money of the day 
""
we anticipate that  when the funds are exhausted from the
lotteries fund  they will there will be capacity for the commitments to be
met  from the general revenue  several-speeches 
""
""
mr deputy president  in view of the changing international
practice mentioned in the answer  will the  se  secretary uh agree
that it will be desirable and will he undertake to see whether it is feasible
 to upgrade the standards for the cross harbour tunnel to be in line with
the newer standards of a hundred and twenty-five parts per million 
speech-by-secretary-for-transport 
""
""
mr deputy president  in the second paragraph of his of his
reply the secretary for transport stated  that all ventilation system of
the tunnels were inspected regularly 
""
are these inspection carry out by  rele  relevant government
department or independent agency 
#> and what action government will take to ensure that ventilation systems
are in good running condition  speech-by-secretary-for-transport 
""
""
deputy president paragraph two of the reply states that 
levels of carbon monoxide are monitored continuously in all tunnels
""
it is known that carbon monoxide leaves the human system very very
slowly 
""
would the secretary for transport inform this council  whether
 h  uh he has a uh can give a better indication of actual levels found
in the tunnels  and whether  pe  it is safe for people to travel in
and use the tunnels repeatedly in the course of a day such as uh in the case
of a bus driver  several-speeches   tape stops 
""
""
 some parts of recording missing  secretary inform this
council whether the administration would encourage the bus companies to
operate only air-conditioned buses  on routes which pass through these
tunnels  so as to avoid the air quality problem  and at the same time
attract more people to use public transport instead of driving their own cars

""
""
thank you mr deputy president
""
i must admit that i fail to uh understand the the reply because all
these are technical terms two hundred and fifty parts per per million during
any thirty minutes

i want to ask a simple question

say if the air in this room has a content of carbon dioxide of two
hundred and  fi  fifty parts per million can we last for thirty
minutes sitting here  without  conducting  any health problems 
several-speeches 
""
""
mr deputy president  i move that the amusement game centres
bill be read the second time 
""
the bill introduced today seeks to establish a new scheme for
licensing amusement game centres  in order to provide better control over
these centres 
""
there are currently six hundred and forty-one licensed amusement
game centres  five hundred fourteen of which are adult centres  and one
hundred and twenty-seven children  ' s centres
""
they are controlled by provisions under the miscellaneous licences
ordinance 
""
licence conditions are imposed on amusement game centre licensees
by the commissioner of television and entertainment licensing  under the
approval of the governor in council 
""
in may nineteen ninety the court of appeal held that a special
licence condition  relating to age restrictions in amusement game centres
 was invalid because the condition was not made by way of regulation 
""
the court considered that when the legislation provided for the
governor in council by regulation to make licence conditions  there was no
power to impose or to establish licence conditions by any other process 
""
this was so notwithstanding regulation nine of the miscellaneous
licences regulations  which empower the commissioner to impose special
licence conditions  under the approval of the governor in council 
""
as a result  only two out of eighteen licence conditions imposed
on amusement game centres licensees are valid  and they have been included
as regulations 
""
these two relate to the transfer of licences and the operating
hours of the centres 
""
all of the others sixteen special conditions were ruled to be ultra
vires and are thus unenforceable 
""
due to the vires problem amusement game centres have increasingly
been operated in a manner which conflicts with the former licence conditions
""
""
consequently unapproved machines and games of an indecent nature
can be found in many centres 
""
age limits are also ignored 
""
there has been public concern over these problems 
""
there is also a need for more effective and stricter control 
over amusement game centres  coupled with much tighter supervision of
licensees occasion by the rapid changes in games machine technology  and
the increasing complexity of the industry 
""
we have therefore decided to separate amusement game centres
licences  from the miscellaneous licences ordinance 
""
the amusement game centres bill  will empower the commissioner
for television and entertainment licensing  to impose licence conditions
""
""
in order to tackle the existing management problems evident in many
centres  the licence conditions will include a number of regulatory
provisions 
""
of greatest significance will be the conditions to prohibit the
installation of any game  which has not been approved by the commissioner
 and bar entry to adult centres to people aged sixteen and above  as
well as to restrict entry to children  ' s centre to persons to the age of
sixteen only 
""
it will be an offence if the licensee contravenes any of the
licence conditions 
""
to have a greater deterrent effect  the bill also provides that
the penalty on second or subsequent conviction  will be heavier than that
on first of conviction 
""
under the miscellaneous licences ordinance  the commissioner was
empowered to revoke or refuse to renew a licence 
""
warning letters were issued to the licensee to urge him to improve
the management  before revocation or non-renewal of a licence was
considered 
""
however many licensees simply ignored these letters  and showed
no improvement until they received a final warning 
""
to ensure the operators observe the license conditions
conscientiously  the commissioner will be empowered to suspend  revoke
 or refuse to renew a license  under specified circumstances  if
license conditions are breached 
""
the suspension of a license  will serve as a serious warning 
that if there is no improvement in management  revocation of the license
will be considered 
""
suspension and revocation of a license  are measures which
should go a long way to protect the interests of the public 
""
an independent appeal board will be set up to consider appeals 
arising from enforcement of the legislation 
""
the board will be chaired by a person qualified for appointment as
a district judge 
""
the bill contains provisions  to allow existing amusement games
centres  '  licenses granted under the miscellaneous licenses ordinance to
continue to be valid  after the enactment of the new bill
