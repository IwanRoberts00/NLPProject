 uh huh  
""
  aw 
""
""
 aw  
 
""
in america 
""
""
aw
""
""
aw
""
""
i see
""
""
uhm
""
""
and we are now doing a project on uh american english also
 
""
oh yeah 
""
""
yah
""
we have to analyse the features of american english and it  ' s
rather difficult for us
 
""
why 
""
""
because we are not familiar with the american   culture
 and we are not the native speaker
""
""
 yes  
 
""
but you  ' ve been to disney 
""
""
huh
  
""
 two-word  i just went for  a   a
week 
""
""
 just for a long  
""
  a week   
""
yes   very  very short time
""
""
 a week  
 
""
oh okay
""
that was enough for american culture for one week 
""
""
  so 
 
""
 what   so difficult about american
""
you see it on television all the time and at the movies
""
i  ' m sure you see more of the american culture than you do with
british or other culture 
""
""
uhm uhm uhm  tut   i think uh the culture between
american and   british  is quite different because i have also been
to london too
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and uh i think uhm for british people they seem to be more
conservative
""
they  ' ll their style of working
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and uh the the way people dress they seem to be more
conservative than those uh americans i think
 
""
uh uhm no i don't i i cant  '  agree with that really
""
it depends how much of it you  ' ve seen 
""
""
pardon
 
""
it really depends how much of each of it you  ' ve seen 
""
""
uhm may be
 
""
haven't you even seen skinhead or a punk you know in london 
""
""
uhm not really
 
""
no 
""
""
not really
 
""
but you know they exist 
""
""
yah i know
 
""
you know what they look like 
""
""
yah
 
""
what do they look like 
""
""
quite strange
 
""
in what way 
""
""
uhm their way of dressing because uh i  ' ve been to  s 
the soho   but only  uh during daytime   because  i i
think in night time there will be more uh punks or uhm other ladies dress in
a very very what in way
 
""
 uh huh  
""
 uh huh  
""
in a very   in  way 
""
""
 but  
""
yeah
 
""
in a   very  
""
""
 fashionable     trendy 
 
""
 yeah    hou yeah  
cantonese=very-funky   haih mai   cantonese=right? 
""
""
""
 hou yeah 
 
""
so you think that is conservative do you 
""
""
uhm no but
 
""
no but 
""
""
but in general overall
 
""
in general 
""
""
yah in general
 
""
  but england was the  england was the was the
birthplace of punk
""
all the best music comes out of the uk 
""
""
 it seems to me  
""
uh huh
 
""
yeah   all the  musicians they are not conservative are
they 
""
""
 uhm  
""
it  ' s only what i i think about it  beca  i i  tut 
just feeling
""
i just feel british are more conservative
""
i don't know
 
""
may be on the surface what about what about inside 
""
""
inside
""
i don't know
""
i  ' m not familiar with both culture
 
""
uh okay 
""
""
and how about you what do you think
""
""
well i have the same opinions with with you
""
""
uh huh
""
""
uhm
 
""
as 
""
""
uh yes  as you
""
""
uh okay
""
""
yes uhm because i have seen a lot of  mo  movies from
hollywood  tut  and also some from uk uhm and they and the image they
present to me seems that uh british british people are more conservative
""
""
yah
""
""
yah
""
uh   i think  i think their their the the subject of
their of the movies are more traditional
 
""
 actually  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
but for the hollywood  ' s  mal  uh movies uhm i think
they the  s  the subjects are more uh they have more varieties of uhm
subjects
 
""
what in america 
""
""
yah
 
""
they do now
""
some of the best movies is to be made in the uk i think 
""
""
uh yes uhm  tut 
 
""
after all they are only movies they are not real life so how can
you judge something by movies 
""
""
yeah but uh but from the imagination
 
""
imagination 
""
""
yes
 
""
okay but don't you realise that a lot of those movies that were
made in hollywood were made uhm or adapted to the screen from books written
by people in other countries 
""
""
some of them
 
""
so they aren't really american interpretations
""
it  ' s somebody else  ' s book or story aren't they 
""
""
uhm   may be 
 
""
 and the   only reason they are so there are so movies
made in hollywood it  ' s because they got more money than everybody else 
""
""
  uhm 
""
""
 yah  
 
""
that  ' s a classic hong kong attitude isn't it 
""
""
yah
 
""
money means quality    but it  ' s not true  
""
""
 uh   no
""
""
but many people thinks so   i think 
""
""
 yes  
 
""
there are many people in hong kong 
""
""
yah
""
""
yah
""
""
people in hong kong are more realistic i think
""
""
  yah 
 
""
 realistic   
""
""
  yes 
""
""
 yah  
""
""
actually actually uhm i think money may also means technology
 
""
uh 
""
""
you you if you don't have enough money  then uhm may be
the image  the scene of the
 
""
sure but that  ' s just the image what about the story 
""
""

""

""
""
uhm no but it helps
""
""
but technology can improves things
""
""
yes
 
""
like what
""
like a story 
""
""
not really in film  in many aspects of life
""
technology really improves life i think
""
but technology requires money
 
""
uh yes and no
""
where does technology come from in the first place 
""
""
science
 
""
and what is science
""
science is all about money 
""
""
 ngaai

""

""
""

""
""

""

""
""

""
""

""
""

them all at nine dollars twenty 
""
""
uh huh
 on the same day
""
""
""
""
on a same day 
""
""
yes
""
""
so quick
 
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah
 
""
cos it  ' s a worthless stock i think
""
there  ' s  no  there  ' s nothing to company 
""
""
yah
""
and and uh have you bought any other stocks
 
""
yeah i bought a lot of stocks before 
""
""
how about the hongkong bank
""
have you bought it
 
""
no 
""
""
why
 
""
not interested in that 
""
""
for long term investment many people are interested in
hongkong bank
 
""
who  ' s interested in long term investment in hong kong 
""
""
most parents i i  ' ve know uh my friends and their parents
want to invest in hongkong bank   shares 
 
""
 uh huh   
""
""
yah
 cos everybody else does
""
""
and uh one of my friends  '  parents bought it at a  fif
 fifty dollars something  
""
uh huh 
""
""
and they  ' ve not sold it even uh it rise to hundred and uh
twenty   or a  hundred thirty yah
 
""
 uh huh  
""
right 
""
""
they think it  ' s long term investment
 
""
yeah but that is only uh two and a half times the original
investment   isn't it  
""
""
 yah  
 
""
okay so if you buy tom bot shop com shares at a dollar and
seventy- eight and you sell them for eleven dollars you make ten times the
money in a week 
""
""
yah
""
you are interested in  st  buying stocks
 
""

but i think it needs much time to do research if you really
want to   gain money 
 
""
 yeah i know    one-word  spent a
little time researching and 
""
""
yah
 
""
and it  ' s a risk    as well  
""
""
 yah  
""
but it  ' s the quick way to earn easy money
 
""
it  ' s a quick way to lose easy money     as well
""
""
""
 yah  
""
yah
 
""
think about the people who make money are not the retail
investors the people of the streets sometimes they get lucky and make money
sometimes they lose money
""
it  ' s only the people who do it professionally and do it everyday
who end up making any money
""
  but  where do they make their money from  people
like you and me 
""
""
 uhm  
""
or depends whether we are fortunate or not
 
""
well yeah but every fortunate person there are two or three
people who aren't fortunate 
""
""
and now i  ' m being unfortunate
 
""

""
""
