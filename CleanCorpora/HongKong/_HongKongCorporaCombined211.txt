good evening ladies and gentlemen i ' m glad that from the onset the proposition side has agreed with us that stabidity stability should be uppermost in our mind during the latter half of the transitional period but this stability how can we achieve this and they have also mentioned that changes if there should be must be within or within confines or in accordance with the basic law  and so far they have stated an american committee style system which in fact itself is not a real american style committee system and it it should adopt the real american style committee system it is definitely without the confines of the basic law which ruled the stabilized de delicate situation of hong kong at the moment  and throughout the debate our side has repeatedly mentioned this that the real american style system should include the power to initiate bills lik including the power to initiate bills concerning public expenditure this is part and partial to the committee system and i ' ve already talked so long about this so i ' m not going to go on it anymore but ladies and gentlemen be reminded that we have mentioned about it and also the american style committee system what we think that it would introduce by introduction of the american style committee system it would bring with it revolutionary changes what we want at the moment of course there maybe some weaknesses in the present system all systems have its weaknesses but we need is to strike a balance between changes and stability and the proposition side in fact has not proved very clearly that the present systems weaknesses are so strong that we need to bring into the hong kong situation a totally foreign system to mak to remedy these weaknesses they have mentioned about political expertise but do we need to  i uh to copy the american style committee system to educate our legislators also they have talked about the power of some of the  officials in fact by the power and privileges ordinance nineteen eighty five  in section nine subsection one the power ini to summon officials to give information and to stand its weaknesses are in fact extended to standard committees and by subsection two are extended to all other committees as well and also they talked about effi inefficiency in fact our side has mentioned that inefficiency is definitely not a very great problem because by the number of bills which passed throughout the year it is just good indicator that efficiency is definitely what we have without one-word find other ways to improve or to further enhance and also monitory powers ladies and gentlemen we have mentioned that to monitor government is not only the work of the legislative council in fact we ' ve already advocated in purpose like relaxing or repealing the official secrets act but they have not responded throughout the debate that this is in fact an incremental change that would be better than bringing in into hong kong a totally foreign and revolutionary committee system ladies and gentlemen as we have mentioned from the very beginning stability in the transitional period a smooth transition is what should be uppermost in our mind  they ' ve talked about the characteristics or the advantages so called of the american style committee system that permanent uh permanent structure from uh formalization staff and open government in fact these are only means to serve the end that is to enhance the functions of the legislature as we ' ve mentioned legislation checking the government and also controlling the  one-word  ladies and gentlemen during the latter half of the transitional period i should say that revolutionary changes should be avoided of course made in america is a label that usually guarantee for good quality but at this stage what we need is made in hong kong which suits the uniqueness of the situation thank you  good evening ladies and gentlemen at this hour tonight i think all of you including me are already very tired and especially exhausted by the confusing arguments of our opponents well let me thank them for their research on the constitu  on the uh american constitution and also their research on the american style committee system i want to say that your research is not wasted however it is my utmost responsibility to clarify our points once more first the american style committee system as said by our captain has mentioned repeatedly many many times we are not introducing the power of initiating bills and killing bills into the hong kong legco the reason is clear it is because these are actually delegated by the american congress mind you the american congress if if they are to be introduced into the hong kong legislative council are we going to change the whole legislative structure in hong kong sure not it ' s insensible  and moreover our opponents have raised the following points first that is about the legco it says that he says he said that the legco a  accountability is a strange analogy to the ca to the american style committee system however in basic law article sixty four it states that we have to make legco to be accountable to the government how it is to be done that is by strengthening the monitoring role of the legco by having an efficient and effective expertise being built in the legco  secondly they said that they want evolution not revolution and they want stability yes we agree with that however we are not radical but in fact we are rational and incremental we are not changing the entire present system but do something to improve the present system in the legco by introducing the american style committee system into it  they also mentioned that we sorry excuse me we have to mention that changes are necessary to prepare legco for the addition or for the additional power given to them by the basic law after nineteen ninety-seven without such preparation in fact will be far worse than having a structure that utilizes expertise well interestingly i just come across the slogan of the hong kong u students ' union which says we care we voice we ' re so glad to see that because these students from hong kong u do have the same attitude with us yes but i want to add one more we see we care and thus we voice  and thirdly about the point on the thirty minutes minute sorry the thirty-minute meeting of the legco well thirty minutes meeting of the legco doesn't mean anything of efficiency mind you it may only mean no insight and no in depth discussion on the issue what you know about the legco and what you know about the reality they uh the reality is that because there are in fact one hundred bills queuing up there for scrutinization so that ' s why they need thirty minutes thirty minutes from actual data you see that the number of ad hoc groups increases from forty eight in nineteen ninety to ninety one to the number of seventy one this year  let me repeat the points that we have raised before ladies and gentlemen first the american style committee system in fact i don't want to waste time to drawl into this because i feel you with an open mind have already understood that well let me bring you to the hong kong context that is the problems that we are facing first we do not have sufficient expertise being built in the legislative system to deal with the problem  second there is relatively low efficiency in tackling with these  problems in terms of time and resources and third the monitoring role of the legislative council to check on the government is not strong enough however if we have the american style committee system being introduced into hong kong legco such problems can be served can be solved the characteristics of the american style committee system are permanence formal structure and style as well as openness to public these will bring about advantages of effectiveness expertise and accountability these advantages in fact totally and rightly solve the problems in hong kong that now our legislative council is facing and these are already explained in full detail by our speakers ladies and gentlemen our argument is clear we don't want to contradict the basic law and we don't want to antagonize beijing government even our governor chris patten believes that there is a danger of confusion and muddling in the roles of executive council and legco at the present stage so please we have no other option please there is no other choice but speech interrupted by chairlady  thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen i sum up from the captain what they  have said who should do the saving so let me give you an analogy on this a couple right in front of me are coach doctor  changrin and mrs changrin  what if doctor changrin is saving all his money that  what if mrs one- word is on the other hand taking out all the money from the bank account doctor one-word saves but she is taking so as a result the bank account will be zero the real truth behind saving is both parties must cooperate that what we are promoting today in today ' s motion cooperation is the main goal and i sum up from the second speaker she asks well make your own bed you lie on it that ' s fine yes that ' s true but ladies and gentlemen environment is global  re  may i repeat environment is global it is not a bed to a particular nation yes you can lie on your own bed and forget about the whole world but environmental issues are threatening you and me globally what i hear some of them from the third speaker is that they are contradicting themselves because they said that they will not confine themselves to monetary terms but summing up from him though it is all from monetary terms so please don't confine ourselves to the monetary payments sacrificing one form with another is a form of payment already  so what is the example if the third world countries could export more tax  one-word their need to sell the timber would be less desperate if europe ' s farmers were not protected then the land values would be lower so as a result they would have less incentives to farm intensively  so ladies and gentlemen the world belongs to everyone of us the problems also belongs to all of us here firstly recognizing that the major environmental problems of the developing countries are not necessarily of the same nature as those of developed countries the pollution ga greenhouse gas emission deforestation endangered species they are all difficult to solve and are all different from one country to another india is facing the serious problem of endangered species and the us is facing serious problem in greenhouse gas emission ladies and gentlemen there is an old chinese saying that every family has their own set of bible there is national air there is national water and there is national environment nobody understands the chinese air the chinese water the chinese soil better than a chinese man each region understands its own problems however your first speaker says that the air well we can provide expertise well even if you have the expertise are one-word  indeed technology you will still have to ask the chinese to let you in  so therefore we can cooperate together to go hand in hand to protect our global environmental assets so look here today the usa says that they want to mend the ozone layer the brazil goes on threatening the whole world that they are chopping up seventy five thousand hectares of forest every year so ladies and gentlemen we need the cooperation of all parties we need all parties to sacrifice that is to pay finally ladies and gentlemen if this motion is going to stand today the scenario would be the developed countries pay for all environmental protection in other words all the others are free free like a bird free from any responsibility our developed countries will pay for us so they don't have to pay anything it ' s so sad ladies and gentlemen heal the world make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race  with this i thank you
