uhm i think a few months ago one of the faculty members actually called us okay at the reference counter and then uhm i guided this faculty member all the way to order a thesis online in the proquest okay and then after two minutes okay after two minutes time he called me back and then he said oh you know antonia i ' ve already got the thesis downloaded into my pc already okay it only took took him about two minutes time to get the thesis so if you are if you desperately would like to get hold of the full text okay almost immediately you might consider you might wish to consider getting the online version okay because it is pretty quick okay so if you would like to get it okay click on order it now and then it costs you twenty nine dollars and fifty cents and mind you this is not hong kong dollars this is us dollars us currency okay and if you would like to get it then you just proceed with the online order okay key in your credit card number and all that and then you know after two or three minutes time you will be informed as to how to download the thesis out of the web okay right so any questions so that ' s for proquest okay so that ' s actually i think the uhm web the data databases for uhm thesis okay now so let ' s proceed to the uhm second batch of questions okay uhm that would be on hong kong uto okay so you click to the second page of the exercise sheet okay i ' d like you to go to hong kong uto okay so if you go back to the homepage click on the hong kong ul digital initiatives and then go to hong kong university thesis online okay you ' ll get to this page okay so may be i ' ll give you uhm five minutes to complete both question number one and question number two okay a long pause  okay so uhm what have you learnt in this hong kong uto exercise okay several things do remember use the and operator again okay i ' m very longwinded but then that ' s very important okay so do not type in higher education in guangzhou okay should be higher education and guangzhou okay use and the operator okay and then of course you can specify the field for searching okay because you ' re not too sure whether you know the words higher education and guangzhou would appear in the title or in the subject okay so the safest way would be select anywhere okay right and in fact you can also specific the time period okay and in the case two thousand one to two thousand one okay because we know that the thesis was published in two thousand and one okay so basically if you follow this you should be able to get the answer right which is marketization of higher education the case study of guangzhou hong kong uh china okay so basically if you type in higher education in guangzhou you wouldn't be able to get this record okay because you can't find this phrase in this record can you see okay so once you ' ve got it okay there are actually two copies of this thesis okay one placed in the education library and the other copy in the special collections okay for uh thesis by education students they usually have to submit two copies for us one uhm to be uh placed in the education library and then the second copy in the special collection okay for other faculty students okay we usually will have only one copy which will be placed in the special collections only okay so if you would like to consult the thesis jot down the call number okay in this case is m ed zero one l one one one okay now basically the call number of our thesis is built on the programme name okay or the master ' s or the uh degree programme abbreviation in this case m ed master in education and o one would be would be the year st uhm which start at two thousand and one okay and if l one one one actually is a code that actually comes from the author ' s name okay the author ' s name is lai begin with l so we have l and then one one one is actually generated by computer programme so that means for the year two thousand and one we have one unique thesis for this call number only okay if there is another student with the last name begin with l the uh that thesis will have a different l number okay right now basically uhm basically for each record we have two link as well okay uh one is for table of content and the other one is the abstract okay if you take your time to uhm click on the pdf icon for table of content will actually get the table of contents displayed online and also the pdf for the uhm abstract okay this will actually give you more information as to uh the content of this thesis uh for you to decide on whether this thesis is relevant to relevant to you or not okay so instead of just relying on the subjects indicated in the record we can actually get a lot of more information about the uhm thesis before went upstairs to get the full text to read it okay now the last uh database that we are going to talk about is uhm index to thesis okay the database that uh focuses on the thesis in great britain and ireland okay now to go to this database you can follow the instructions i have given you in the exercise sheet okay which is very complicated i would say okay so i ' m going to show you a more simple way to access this database okay so if you stay with the screen for the hong kong uto at the very bottom you will see a link for relevant websites okay click on that you will see a list of websites and in fact from this list you you will also see proquest digital dissertations right over here as well okay and the same time you can also see index to thesis okay now the other databases okay mostly the other databases were actually the thesis will also be contained in the proquest already okay so actually proquest will actually help you to uhm search the other resources as well okay so basically index to thesis and proquest will be uh pretty sufficient okay so let us click on index to thesis okay to access this database so in the future you do not have to uhm you do not have to remember the name of you know proquest digital dissertations or index to thesis you just go to one single place which is the hong kong uto page go all the way down and then click on relevant websites from there you ' ll be a able to access all these databases or dissertations okay now our two thousand and two subscription okay is not activated yet okay but we can search the older materials okay so if you click on search button on the left okay you ' ll see uhm four different search method okay we have quick search simple search standard and advanced okay uhm my favourite search interface here okay is the standard search okay so click on the standard the reason why i prefer the standard search is that here you can select the field for searching on this side okay right so like click on any field and then in the search box i can actually uhm type in my search statement okay so i ' ve one question for you for index to thesis okay that is okay what is the name of the student who wrote the thesis about the personal and social development of s student leaders of hong kong universities okay now because this uhm thesis was done in uh uk uh university we ' ll select it back to the thesis this database to search okay so i ' ll let you have two minutes to find out the answer a long pause  okay so all of you manage to get the uhm tut title right okay so you will find that actually this uhm database the search interface with this database is not as sophisticated as the proquest okay you cannot order the thesis online here okay so if you have a favourite if you have spotted a favourite thesis in this database you cannot actually key in your credit card number and then get it online or anything like as you have done in proquest okay right but anyway if you found a good thesis from this database you can actually get it from the interlibrary loans okay now very quickly i ' ll go through okay uh for those who are not aware of the online form okay i ' ll very quickly go through how you can actually get the thesis online uhm through or order the thesis online through the interlibrary loans uhm service okay from the homepage if you go under e-forms select iliad okay which is the interlibrary loans request form okay from this page since you are a hong kong u student okay click on this link then you can key in your information okay now uh the information that you have to key in includes your name okay

try to renew your books online okay under uh view your circulation record in dragon okay all right so you submit the information and then you have to carefully read through the copyright declaration and then accept it okay if you would like to accept it okay uhm uhm okay now actually because i ' ve been to my record already okay if this is your first time go into your record you will have to uhm confirm your personal information okay and then once you confirm the information you have to click on add account okay have you ever gone into your account okay right uhm you click on add account and
