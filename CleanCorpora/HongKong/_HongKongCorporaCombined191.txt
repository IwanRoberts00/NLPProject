well a very good evening welcome to the macau jockey club ' s taipo racecourse  once again we have uh sand racing this evening ten races on the sand surface the going  normal watering and runners behind the barriers for race number two this is the roscommon handicap class six gallopers over fifteen hundred metres  and favourite throughout number five fruitful always just ahead of number four beautiful dancer  uh just quickly our commentators selections for this second event we will bring you a replay of race one in around fifteen minutes time  franko lau in race two likes four five six  beautiful dancer to defeat fruitful always and siu yik  harry troy has gone the way of one universe to defeat five fruitful always and six siu yik as we get the blue light  i ' ve gone the way of uh five fruitful always very unlucky two starts back  and then performed pretty well last time had his chance but again i think must be considered the top three banker in the race number five fruitful always  one universe i think is the danger very well graded i would have tipped him on top but he is only a a small type only weighing around nine hundred and fifty pounds carrying a big weight one thirty two pounds so  on that score i ' ve had to put him second just because of the big weight and he ' s only a lightly framed horse  and i thought the value in the race was number nine house of fortunes  he is coming into the race fit where a few of these are coming in first up for the season  and i thought his past couple of runs haven't been too bad and uh i think he ' s uh one of value that can actually figure in his race so i ' m going five one and nine  uh siu yik  a lot of support for him first up for the season i thought he would just improve a touch with the run  there ' s no doubt he ' s coming in with a little bit of improvement in him  quickly i ' ll go through the changes for tonight ' s programme in the first really clear was out replaced by the second standby sunny ' s legend barrier ten and danny beasley rode  think uh the danny beasley factor also sees uh number six siu yik very short in this event coming up  no changes in race two in the third number six preston is out no replacement race six number six preston  race four is clear in race five take out number one full steam he ' s replaced by the first stand best come barrier eleven and ricky lei takes that ride  one changes in race six  in the seventh we have a riding change number three evolution k s lei takes over from the suspended jackie yip  race eight and nine are clear of changes  and in fact so is race ten so that brings you up to date with all the changes for tonight ' s programme  for this second event it ' s twenty nine fifty  in fact now sorry thirty dollars for number five uh fruitful always beautiful dancer  he ' s been solid throughout on thirty four fifty  fifty five dollars for siu yik universe was a double figure quote earlier  he ' s down to seventy dollars and number nine house of fortune is around from twenty five down to fifteen  so he ' s just being specked a little  we ' ll be joined later on by franko lau i ' m the captain steve mooney we now get the red light for race number two as we cross over to harry troy i like the chances of five one and nine  thanks steve and a very good evening everyone as the runners start to load for the second of the night  favourite throughout has been fruitful always  good effort last start  a little support for the top weight universe  and well supported has been number four beautiful dancer and likewise siu yik  number six the mount of danny beasley now a little bit restless in gate four is explorer  they ' re off and running  came out okay explorer slow into stride was money come in the early part it ' s universe striding forward to take up the running  booting up on the inside there to go with him is his stable mate beautiful dancer  a little bit deep best tiger right on the backs of them house of fortune ' s not too far away fruitful always  followed then by money come he ' s recovered he ' s midfield the rails to his outside explorer  followed then by siu yik as they go by the twelve hundred  drifting back was rapid stride and victory together is the tail ender  into the back we ' ve got a line of three on the lead and it ' s beautiful dancer just showing out a narrow leader from three deep money come universe with the seat in the centre of them  followed then by fruitful always going forward and he ' s going to be prominent  on the back of them house of fortunes travelling well  followed then by siu yik in the lime cap going forward but a little bit deep rapid stride as they go by the seven hundred  followed then by one taking off from the back and that was uh uh explorer followed then by money come and he ' s starting to drop back now money come  and victory together is the tail ender  five hundred metres out we ' ve got a line of three on the lead  we ' ve got beautiful dancer in the centre money come and crowded a bit deep on the outside is fruitful always  followed then by universe just behind them a little bit deep siu yik and house of fortune ' s right there they straighten for the run in  in front beautiful dancer a little bit tight for best tiger fruitful always raced up now and took the lead away  running on fairly well universe but fruitful always inside the final two hundred dashed away  fruitful always nicely clear from beautiful dancer  running on universe when the race is all over but nicely clear fruitful always and kept going by robbie burke he ' s going to take it the prize fruitful always first  it ' s going to be close for second beautiful dancer just in advance of house of fortune  close up universe  followed then by explorer then came siu yik money come best tiger did weaken away he ' s finished near the tail of the field and just forward of him was rapid stride with victory together  and we straighten up for the run in and it was beautiful dancer in front but taken on very quickly by the favourite fruitful always  running on well universe oh checked out of it there house of fortunes  now he ' s in a photo for second and he was checked out of it by beautiful dancer so you ' ll hear more of this  universe running on just fairly down the outside  and not too far away siu yik who just seemed to run out of condition over the final stages  but a nice ride and an easy win to number five fruitful always  got on the speed pretty early was on a line of three when they straightened up and he takes the prize  now it ' s pretty close for second beautiful dancer  and house of fortunes and house of fortunes badly inconvenienced so great chance of reversing that they do have the enquiry sign up already  it ' s five four nine and one as they stand and the winner number five fruitful always a five year old bay irish bred by ezzoud from adacama and robbie burke riding for p k wong  and number nine house of fortunes is second  uh rather number four beautiful dancer is second for the moment  peter lau for stephen leung  and number nine house of fortunes in third francie naude for william lai officially fourth number one universe  so that ' s five four nine and one after the running of race number two  and no doubt you ' ll hear a little more about the incident inside the final two hundred  i just wonder because uh beautiful dancer was always holding that rails position  and house of fortunes was getting that run behind him i just wonder if he was just always holding his ground uh  beautiful dancer rather than uh house of fortunes being inconvenienced  there was probably never even a run there i think but uh the stewards will probably sort that out of course  five four nine the numbers that count but obviously an enquiry due to the fact that uh house of fortunes did have to check at around the one hundred and fifty metre mark  race three tonight is the listowel handicap class five gallopers preston is out no replacements  the early favourite is the topee super transformer  now let ' s have a look at this as you can see he is always hard up against the fence here uh beautiful dancer so i really doubt there was actually ever any room there  steve that ' s a that ' s a little bit late there was definitely room for him uh that ' s a that ' s a mile too late  and he was badly inconvenienced so  he ' s definitely he ' s definitely had to check there ' s no doubt about that  yip yip that ' s a that ' s a good way too late he was away from the rail and  there was room for him and he started to sneak up from about shortly after they straightened so it ' s a shame we just can't get ah ah another look at that from ah a bit further back to the top of the straight  so five four nine are the numbers we ' re just trying to try and sort out that uh  try and get that uh head on replay a little further back but unfortunately we ' re running out of time we have to go to a commercial break so  five four nine are the numbers as they stand at the moment  one thirty eight point three is the run time   commercial break  welcome back live to taipo racecourse we bring you the news that there is an objection uh at this stage obviously it looks to be third against second house of fortunes  uh against beautiful dancer five four and nine across the line  and hopefully we ' ll be able to bring you another uh replay of that head on shot which saw uh house of fortunes lose quite a bit of ground the question is if the run was there we ' ll he should be getting that second position  but we ' ll just uh hopefully see that head on replay in a minute  they ran one thirty eight point three  the winner should be safe tony wong and robbie burke with fruitful always  and it is third against second just confirming as you can see on your screens  officially fourth was number one universe  so the favourite winning the second  good ride too by robbie burke  and now just awaiting these replays to give us an idea of whether this objection will be successful  it ' s all counting on if the run was there because if it was there it ' s certainly uh lost uh quite a bit ground probably uh well over a length and being only a short head between the second and third horse it ' d have to be a big hope  but first of all we ' ll need to have another look now here uh this will give us a good idea  now you can see beautiful dancer in the orange cap  at this stage he ' s travelling behind beautiful dancer who ' s on the fence in the white cap  and on the outside of beautiful dancer here is best tiger now as they turn for home  you can see he does uh roll off half a horse here uh beautiful dancer peter lau
