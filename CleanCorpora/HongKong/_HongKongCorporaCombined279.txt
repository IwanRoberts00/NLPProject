the front pages of the monday papers were splashed with the sad faces of mrs anson chan and mr tim fok hong kong has failed in his bid to host the two thousand six asian games what is the cause of the hong kong ' s failure could we have won if we have done more i have no answers to these questions but i am sure that hong kong is grateful for the efforts of mrs chan and mr fok a success would have confirmed that our confidence is well founded but a failure i believe could do hong kong as much good as a success instead of looking outwards with confidence it is time for hong kong to look inwards to reflect on our strengths and weaknesses should we be awarded the games by two thousand six we will have a world class stadium at the site of the old airport and all our sports facilities will be upgraded it will take the same time for hong kong to replace all our diesel taxis air pollution is a problem we can better understand than how to bring in a major sports event but for various reasons the air quality of hong kong is not improving as fast as we like it to be the major cause of air pollution in the urban areas is our fleet of a hundred fifty thousand diesel vehicles nearly all the commercial vehicles are diesel fueled these include the taxis mini-buses full-sized buses trucks and other heavy vehicles together these vehicles contributed two third of the mileage covered by all road using motor vehicles in hong kong everyday the exhaust emissions from the diesel engines are the major sources of suspended particles sulphur dioxide nitrous oxide and ozone these exhaust emissions reacts with the exhaust emissions that are coming into hong kong from our neighbour to produce the alarming smog effects and dramatic reduction in visibility in the winter months our neighbour must not be blamed for our air pollution the main sources of pollution remain local the smog serves only as a reminder of the problem neither is visibility my main concern my main concern is the health effects of air pollution these pollutants have been proven to cause attacks of asthma progressive deterioration in lung functions nose allergies and even cancers it has been shown recently that admission to hospitals caused by asthmatic attacks and acute deterioration of patients with chronic lung problems increases with the worsening of air quality sulphur dioxide has been shown to associate closely with lung cancer the exhaust emissions from diesel engines have been classified a probable cause of cancers by the world health organization the ill effects of some of these pollutants are cumulative and impact most severely on people already suffering from chronic lung diseases there are no safe levels for these pollutants to a doctor allowing the unsatisfactory air qua quality to persist is like allowing a treatable cancer to remain untreated in his year nineteen ninety nine policy address the chief executive mr tung chee hwa announced a programme of measures to reduce the exhaust emissions from motor vehicles since then it has become the government ' s policy to gradually phase out the diesel taxi and replace them gradually with the more environmentally friendly liquid petroleum gas lpg taxis the phasing out will take up till two thousand six to allow for the usual life span of a diesel taxi and to allow the time for setting up an adequate number of lpg filling stations this will solve about one quarter of the problem the test on lpg and electric mini-buses will go on till next year a decision will then be made on the fate of the diesel mini-buses it will take most likely another seven years to replace them some diesel vehicles will remain on the roads in particular the heavy vehicles to decrease their environmental impact various stringent requirements on emission control the euro three which is the latest european union requirements will be applied starting next year to the new diesel vehicles owners of old diesel vehicles will be encouraged to adopt remedial measures such as by installing the particulate trap and the oxidative catalysts all commercial vehicles will be subjected to an advanced smoke test as part of the annual ro road worthiness inspection the fine on smoky vehicles will be increased to a thousand dollar the replacement of regular diesel with ultra-low sulphur diesel ulsd will reduce the emission of suspended particles and nitrogen oxides the introduction of ulsd has been encouraged by concessionary fuelled duty even though the fuel companies have been criticized for not passing on the full benefit of the tax concession to consumers it is satisfying to see that the only diesel available now at the fuel stations is ulsd to ensure that ulsd will be used enforcement action against the sales of illegal diesel has to be stepped up i appeal for the franchise bus companies to switch over to the more environmental friendly fuel is stepping up of control measures since last year warranted the answer is yes both in terms of the overt effects and the health effects of air pollution in nineteen ninety one visibility fell below eight kilometres for less than five percent of time in nineteen ninety seven visibility fell below eight kilometres per for ten percent of the time over the same period of time the annual mean roadside measurements of respirable suspended particles and nitrous oxide have progressively increased exceeding the one-year air quality objectives set by the environmental protection department the only important achievement is a reduction in sulphur dioxide level excess health risks were noted even on days when the measurements were below the current set of air quality objectives controlling the exhaust emission of the diesel vehicles is addressing only part of the problem the stationary source of air pollution remain to be tackled these are the power stations and other industrial activities standards of emission control for these sources have to be set up or reviewed and vigourously enforced more stringent control on the sulphur contents of diesel for industrial use is in order  controlling air pollution requires the political determination of the government to push through the measures within a reasonable time frame and often for the input of resources it will certainly help if hong kong people are not merely passive beneficiaries of an improved air quality but also become part of the solution the very least we can do is to use our motor vehicles only when absolutely necessary turn off the ignition when the car is stationary and keep our cars in proper state of maintenance let us make hong kong a city not only fit for the asian games but also a city fit for the healthiest of all pursuits  in november last year the dutch parliament approved the bill to exempt doctors who perform euthanasia under strict criteria from criminal prosecution the bill will become law if it were passed in the upper house of the netherlands and the country will become the second place in the whole world to legislate on mercy killing the dutch ministry of justice maintains that the bill does not amount to the legalization of euthanasia but to decriminalize euthanasia in certain circumstances a doctor in the netherlands currently performing euthanasia must first report what remains a criminal act to a regional review committees of doctors and lawyers this committee advise the public prosecution service which only then drops the case if the doctor is judged to have followed the specific criteria the new bill allows euthanasia performed by a doctor not to be treated as a criminal offense if the criteria are followed the regional committees will be able to dismiss the case if the bill were to become law even though the public prosecution service could still launch its own criminal investigation doctors has spoken off the psychological significance of no longer being guilty until proved innocent the bill defines the criteria under which the performance of euthanasia by doctors will not be treated as criminal doctors must be convinced that the patient ' s request is voluntary and well considered and that the patient is facing unremitting and unbearable suffering have advised the patient of his or her situation and prospects and have reached a firm conclusion with the patient that there is no reasonable alternative at least one other independent physician must have examined the patient the royal dutch medical association welcomed the approval of the bill by parliament the association believe that netherlands will benefit from the possibility that patient can request euthanasia from doctors in situation of hopeless and unbearable suffering politicians hope that the new leg legal clarity will boost the rates of reporting and thus able to put euthanasia under better regulation currently less than fifty percent of an estimated three thousand six hundred cases of euthanasia a year are reported but both protestant and catholic communities fear that choosing to die will become a normal practice whether the netherlands will benefit from the legislation remains to be seen i believe that they can learn from the experience of australia the northern territory of australia is the first place in the whole world to legislate on mercy killing only to have the law repealed nine months after it has taken effect the provision of euthanasia for the terminally ill was legal in the northern territory of australia for nine months between july nineteen ninety six and march nineteen ninety seven during this time seven patients all with cancer made formal use of the act and four of them died under the act a report was compiled on these seven patients and was published in a leading medical journal the act stipulated that two doctors had to agree that a patient had a terminal illness that would result in the patient ' s death in the normal course and without application of extraordinary measures but one of the finding of the report was that and i quote the potential length of future life of a patient with cancer can be very difficult to judge accurately and differences of expert opinion were evident in two of these cases one case was a fifty-two-year-old woman with cancerous skin condition who had well controlled pain but itchiness had resulted in intense scratching followed by skin infection eyelid swelling with closure and a persistent ear discharge one cancer specialist gave the patient ' s prognosis as nine months but a dermatologist and local oncologist judged that she was not terminally ill other doctors declined to give opinions after a national television appeal an orthopaedic surgeon agreed to see her and certified that the provisions under the act had been complied with she underwent euthanasia on the second january nineteen ninety seven the act specifically requires a psychiatrist to confirm that patients do not have a treatable clinical depression according to the report however four of the seven cases had symptoms of depression including reduced reactivity lowered mood hopelessness and suicidal thoughts confirmation of depression was not easy because the patients saw the psychiatric assessment as a hurdle to be overcome before their wish to die is granted will the hong kong people welcome legalizing euthanasia i do not have an answer to that but i believe that it would be a most interesting debate if the subject were brought up in the legislative council hong kong doctors are very cautious on this issue we value our profession as one that is to save life rather than one is to take away life euthanasia if taken to mean giving or not giving treatment with the intention to kill a patient is not acceptable i believe to the majority of doctors in hong kong we however can accept stopping useless treatment a treatment is useless when it will not have any effect whatsoever on the patient and won't affect the outcome whether it is given or not it is not the doctor ' s intention to let the patient die by stopping useless treatment useless treatment is stopped simply because it is useless even then what is useless treatment can still be a matter of great controversy a social debate on euthanasia can lead us to into a reflection on the meaning of life the sovereignty of life death and whether we have the right to choose to die the last month of the lunar year is an auspicious month for reflection reflection on death can be a most refreshing experience and i must assure you that you won't die earlier by so doing
