year no you came back in uh what time you came back september october october october october november decem  december jan yeah is half year right  and you ' re still jobless  octo december three words     not  not exactly just may be four four months five months okay uhm no you came back in october it ' s half year from now october november december one word    you really need a job  right okay  but   i ' m going to work hard to get a job try hard okay but i don't think being an gent in gent   an insurance agent is good idea  i ' m going to try hard  i am going to try hard okay okay i believe you thank you very much but if you get the licence for the insurance what licence insurance licence insurance okay but i don't know may be after a month a week huh may be after the weeks they send a mail two words   yeah they ' ll tell you you fail in that yeah but i don't know i may fail paper three i didn't study one word   but okay if you pass huh if you pass uh huh both of them are you going to be a agent yeah i think so you are sure aia uh huh at least they give me uh eight thousand pay at least basic salary  eight thousand   eight thousand  yeah basic salary or advance payment   basic salary  basic sala of course basic salary no you have to check you have to check a contract yeah it ' s basic salary right uhm shit i don't know i told you i worked in pc i ' pci ' one word uh the contract they wrote is four thousand advance payment so if you don't pass the exam in three months you have to pay back them four thousand dollars  uh  of course you are part-time job okay no no no my friend was supposed to be full-time  oh an interjection  and they have to pay back one have to pay back four thousand bucks and the other had to pay back eight thousand bucks   uhm uhm i don't know i think i don't need to pay back right  really i should ask my boss  i hope so   no but   do i need to pay back if i don't pass the exam no it depends o what what kind of basic salary they depends because if it counts on the quota you are working if uh uh uh uhm on the bills you ' ve done  uhm  uhm uhm so you may not get eight thousand dollars may be you need uhm fifteen thousand dollars of fuck insurance uhm in order to get the eight thousand dollars or no no no they tell me is some kind of allowance not the basic salary i don't know  it ' s proportional  so that ' s it our four thousand dollars was called allowance as well you have to check that you have to ask him if i didn't meet the quota   can i get the eight thousand as well  oh   okay  uhm because th those insurance agents is not trustable i ' m not going to trust any insurance agent anymore i tell you then did you give uhm pay her pay him back the   of course not i passed the exam in one take all right i ' m a genius i ' m too fool probably is of course you don't move and you eat okay that ' s why i ' m too full yeah and you ' re fat   and i ' m too fat yeah i ' m getting fat oh of course okay i just really want to stop the conversation okay uh damn what damn why nothing just like when you think about if you got a friend like you how happy i am  uh   huh  why nothing just so happy too happy too happy for having a friend like mine uhm why too happy you are so beautiful genius uh huh yeah thank you thank you for your compliment you are very nice uhm of course you ' ve been so sarcastic uhm uhm uhm uhm i don't know it was   i want one word  uhm  four words  well actually it was funny how i get to know you because i don't know you the night we were in karaoke okay i was out right i don't remember i don't know it at all i just talked to carmen   carmen   yeah  we didn't talked before  yeah  uhm uhm and then the reason i talked to you because you came back to hong kong really no i talked to same time in australia uh through william and fung really uhm no you were talking with carmen i guess no because you ' re only interested in talking to  carmen you are not interested in talking to me  a few words  no i ' m not like the guy if i ' m not interested in you i ' m not going to talk to you i ' m not that that kind of people okay   oh really uhm uhm uhm i don't think you did talk to me we did uhm no i ' m not shy did we talk when we were we left perth and then we were touring around uhm and then yeah because william called every night  and you ' re studying with him  no   huh  yeah did we talked in the phone uhm no i don't remember   yah yes because y you called carmen whenever william cut down the phone with me and then  you hook up  did   did i  yes because i remember that night was carmen ' s birthday and then william called then he said it was carmen ' s birthday let uh tyno called her and you just say oh okay and really called carmen yah  really  did i  i just call   yes and there was one night we were in kings in the market you were calling her uhm uhm yeah and there was one night in casino  really  but i don't remember yup of course because you ' ve been calling her too many times  don't remember   too many times okay too many times no but that was funny you two s were studying right uh huh so then how come you have time to call us why not because you two should be studying okay the old story should a secondary student go to dating okay what uhm tut what was it there was a some kind of topic is like uh should a secondary student go to dating out with a girl or boy uhm uhm something like that uhm uhm just like what you want to say yesterday but you are going to call it carmen too much right no i mean i mean like you and william as well not me only william   i don't mean you really mean too much i was just kidding i know i understand i ' ve got it okay but not me only william i was studying so hard you know oh really uhm uhm uhm you ' ve sleeping in the computer room of course computer room is not a classroom or lecture room okay  yeah you were   it ' s just a leisure time but you were supposed to be studying for what i don't know y you two failed all your subject no no no you two pretend to be sick and delayed the exam yeah that was william yeah i don't know okay there was a policy for the most of the student uh huh when they studied too hard uh huh that ' s why they ' re going to sick uhm uhm that ' s why we need a mc okay uhm you ' re going to be have the same tut like experiment later uhm may be what you will be have same experiment later when you have sick but you ' ve got to go to attend the exam yeah then you need a mc   yeah but i won't sleep in the computer room sorry look i ' m so tired that ' s why i ' m sleeping okay  okay okay but you shouldn't go to the computer room to sleep you should stay home stay what stay home stay home yeah what was it  s i know you were tired so stay home and sleep don't you understand that my home is far fuck far away f  from the uni then why did you go to the uni good idea  why did you do to the uni  where did you live  where did you live uh late night may be no where did you live far far away from the uni lo a phrase-final particle  i know where ' s the the the place yorka what what what is that yorka yorka yorcha yorka is not yuccha yorka yorka yorka is like one-word in perth okay  which side  which side  north   west side  uhm   west west west okay northwest yes whatever i don't know never mind you can check it on the internet it ' s really far isn't because william used to live in  northbridge and it ' s really close william moved already i didn't live with william later yah he used to live in muslim park and then he moves to   he moved to   move to ve very far away from the uni a little bit not that far a little bit  muslim park i lived in muslim park but not with the uh clermont uh clermont  ecu but with mallory i know mallory  mallory is close to where william used to live  two words, etc  uh the first avenue uh avenue uh uh uh northbridge oh yeah yeah first avenue so is not that far muslim park going to northbridge is not too far just half hour half hour but just driving car and if you go to take a train and then take a bus that ' s take you more than half more than one hour really yes because when you are travelling on the train   oh yes because you don't have a car  yeah the timetable yeah i know if they are not match you got away in it   a few words   stupid bus  i hate the bus in perth it ' s okay because you get a timetable you can check it what time you should go out   but it takes too long there was once carmen and i were in clermont uhm uhm we took the bus to molly uhm uhm took up one hour and fifteen minutes one hour that ' s why i ' m you are going to cross very much a lot of time to go in somewhere else we were cheated we had no where to go uhm uhm and then our guide stanley you remember his name which one stanley stanley yeah our tour guide no anyway uh that guide in our tour he told us to go to molly with the shopping mall uhm uhm and then i s we say yeah uh we ' ll go but he didn't tell us how long is going to take uhm uhm so we get all the way to molly uhm uhm   we stayed there for one hour  uhm   and then we have to go home before dark because we had a farewell party that night uhm  farewell party but we  and  so we took one and a half hour almost one and a half to get to molly stayed there for one hour and then one and a half h more hour to back to muslim  park molly molly is ve very far away from muslim park really really far away uhm from where near lo uh mallory yeah yeah is that far uhm may be you should drive more than more fifteen minutes  on uh  the way we go to molly passed by ecu uhm uhm yeah that ' s mallory yeah but molly is way far more far away yeah i remember we have to actually g the bus actually go into ecu uhm uhm uhm whatever never mind w we are in hong kong now yeah but i miss perth  why   i miss perth uhm what make you miss perth i don't know we had happy times somehow  with who william no no carmen okay but carmen is in us now yeah so

you will say okay i ' m going to live without any excited oh yeah probably i don't know may be because i just went there for sight seeing uhm uhm yeah   or for the course and that ' s why i like it but may be if i ' m going to stay there for one year i ' m going to kill myself that ' s what i ' m thinking and if you ' re   yeah may be because uh the girls we ' re hanging out with are fun uhm uhm
