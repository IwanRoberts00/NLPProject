is that are are are many student go
 but 
 in my school there is no

some are
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
there is
i only know one principal in hong kong 
schools
her name is sister margaret 
 uhm 
 uh ha 
 sister margaret 
 
 you know her

$b and
$z laugh 
you know
 
how many schools in in hong kong are church school 
i haven't count but uhm 
 uhm i don't know the number
so many
there are many
 
half 
secondary school maybe seventy something
yes 
 in generally school there ' s more 
more this kind of school
 maybe 
 uh i have some 
 uh i 
 
seventy percent or 
i mean
i think sixty percent 
 no no no 
 
sixty percent that many 
 so 
no not so many
i don't think so
i i don't know actually
don't ask me
 
but you don't teach in a uh church school 
 i 
no no
i teach in government school
 
is that better or worse 
worse
 
why 
uhm
most of the government school is is worse
because they have to accept 
those student which is not accepted by other change 
school
 
oh
so you get poor students 
 no private school is not so good
you mean uhm
 yes 
i mean government 
 government school 
 public 
 public school is very good is it
oh no no no
 several words 
in uh
just a small portion is
 all of the government school is not good 
 aw 
 that that most are not good 
aw
 but some are really very good
 most are 
yes that some
a few
 they are among the top
 
 uh 
 uh 
 yes 
the band one school
 
but you have to have good test score to go to
the schools 
so most of the schools are further down 
 yes 
yeah yeah
 uhm 
 
so you miss the library class last week
even though you were there of this library 
why
why 
$b laughs 
 
uhm everyone want to give me excuses 
why
give you what kind of excuses 
 
 oh we can't teach well because 
the principal doesn't care the parents don't care 
 oh 
 what is the topic that that you talk about
last time
last time
 
summary 
 oh 
 yes 
just summary and give the uh topic of essays
 
yeah yeah
not many people have thought about their essays 
uhm uhm
i i have writed uh introduction
just leave it special
 
 but 
you know what three chapters are using 
 yes yes 
 no i can't decide on which three
 uhm 
 
 uhm 
i quite interested in in uh discussing about the
behaviour of student because 
in my school there ' s so many student like uh bad behave
but i ' m but i think that ' s one-word
 
 
 how how badly do they behave 
uhm
 
 do they drunk 
 during during the lesson they they talk
too much
or even walk around on the classroom
 
so they ' re rowdy
but they ' re not discipline problems 
 not discipline 
uh some of the student
 
boys or girl 
 boys 
 all boys 
 laughs 
because uh my school is boys ' school 
 usually boys are like that
my school is boys ' school
 
 wo wo would you prefer to work at a girls '
school 
no
uh i don't want
i don't want to worry 
 you will be a
you will be a star fair usually the first
unidentified speaker laughs 
 i don't want to be a 
 
 why 
 because in a girls ' school
most female
uh most male teachers would be the the
would have many fans
yes the little girl
they can start up the fan club 
 and
 laugh 
yeah
they like they like they like boys
uh
 
they have a cross sort out the male teacher 
 not not not really
maybe it is that not so many male teachers
yeah
yes
 especially the young young male teachers
 may not have occur on that 
 
but would you have better students in a girls ' school 
no
it ' s not the better
 
but they wouldn't be as rowdy
there wouldn't be discipline problem 
maybe
 not not quite 
 
 it ' s serious problem 
not quite serious 
 sometimes sometimes
but not quite serious
yes yes
they they talk and chat
but some are healthy noise is okay
i i don't want complete silence you know the first
unidentified speaker laughs 
that mean ' s they ' re sleeping
they uhm as long as they have some kind of discussion is okay
 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm 
uh or even they chat
uh sometimes i let them 
uh but there are no serious uh pro 
 
 uhm 
 because for a boy
they can talk so many dirty things 
uh which is the girl will not talk at
 oh yes 
 boys are like that 
 
so maybe the best school would be a co-ed school 
maybe
my first year is spent in a co co-ed school
 
but then you change 
 just for one year 
yes
i then
then i change the the school
 
why 
uhm 
i i still feel very frustrated sometimes
because the boys are really very naughty there
 
uhm 
but after i go to the girl ' s school
i think uh there is no much challenge 
 and
 laugh 
and i and i miss that school again 
 laughs 
it ' s quite good actually
it ' s not very naughty already
 
uhm 
i mean the original one
 yes 
if you compare of course
the girl ' s school now i i ' m teaching in is must have better
discipline
but uh they are more lively you know
the the the co-ed school is more lively
and it is so good
 
 uhm 
 more 
 uhm 
 uhm 
but you only taught at one school 
yes i just
 
and you ' ll teach there for thirty forty more years 
 you are starting your second year
yes i am starting 
 yes i ' m starting my third year
 
at that school 
no no not
now i ' m starting my third year teaching
 
at that school or teaching anywhere 
no no no
the first year is in the co-ed school
and then the secondary year in the school i ' m teaching
now and
 
 uh okay 
but you ' re
this is only your second year of teaching 
yes
 
what did you do before you taught 
i ' m just graduated
after she he he teach 
 after graduate i i 
i come to to my school teach
and after now is starting my second
 
but if you ' re
if you ' re twenty-six 
just twenty-six
just twenty-six 
$z laughs 
yeah 
$b and
$z laugh 
why you
you should be younger than me
 
yeah
because if you graduated when you are twenty-one and
twenty-two 
 several words 
 
okay
so you graduate when you are twenty-two 
should be ten twenty-two normally
 normally
yes i am twenty-two
 but i was late
i ' m late
i ' m older 
because i i send 
 yes because i 
my third year you know
and i ' m even younger than one-word the
first unidentified speaker laughs 
 i think you are younger than me you know
because you you just have your your 
second year teaching
 okay 
 uh ha uh ha 
 maybe maybe i i 
two-words 
 you take more in second
yes
yes uh second 
 i take more years in second years
 
so you get pass a test
pass exam 
yes
 
college exam 
so you took it
uh which extra year did you take
senior seven or something 
 si uh
actually is seven but i repeat repeat my uh form five
 
form five 
yes
 
because you didn't do well 
yeah uhm the 
uhm
 yes some some students is 
namely 
 
 you were lazy 
maybe at that time 
maybe at that time
but after i failures
i i try my best yes 
 no don't say that 
 he got a good yes 
just try uhm once again 
yes
 try again 
 
uhm
 but uh 
 this is always a good experience for students
 students would would admire that if you are able
to share with them
 and this 
 maybe 
 so that ' s why 
that ' s why i i never blame my student uh not
 not doing well
 because sometimes in some uh lower banding
or or or in some we say bad school
 of not doing well 
 you just tried i mean 
 
uhm 
the atm the environment is not encourage student to
study 
so uh this not not their fault
 
 uhm uhm 
yes but finally he he still survive you know
 yes that is a good
 
 uhm 
more important point is is you try
 just try it 
 
 uhm uhm 
okay
it doesn't hong kong univers 
hong kong have a policy
only five percent can repeat 
no
 is it uhm 
 
 no 
isn't there a policy 
no
 
it limit the number of people who can repeat 
 you can you can you can uh uh act as a 
personal candidates in the public exam 
 for expense 
especially for public examination
no one would border you
 you can try for uh ma for many times as
many times as you like
 yes 
 
but one of the students said in class
i said oh uhm
you can fail everyone
and they said no we can't fail them
because the principal says 
 oh this is oh lower form 
 oh but 
 for the lower form
not for form five
but he is not young at that time
he ' s already form five
 
 uh 
 oh 
 after form five
you can you can take many times the public exam
but even you are not in school
 
uh
how many people do that 
so many
yes you can try
so many
 
twenty thirty percent 
that high 
i have no two-words 
 two-words 
yeah
but i i know this so many student 
 are are try 
 they 
 but some would not be success
they will fail being some 
so he is very good already
he can survive and and success
 
 sure sure 
uhm 
you can try but not means you can success
 uh ha 
 
 uhm 
 yes 
and he could enter the ust
 
so did you go to hong kong u 
yes
 
what department 
physics
 
physics
and you went here 
no no no i ' m in cu
chinese u
 
yeah yeah okay 
 i i take statistics
 
only statistics 
yes 
it ' s just like we are doing an interview you know all-laugh
 speech by the first unidentified speaker 
i will come to your company all-laugh 
 
well i don't know what else 
 would you offer a place for me
 
how much money do you want
what is the first question you ask when you go for an interview
how much money 
i can't ask you know
 usually i will
 ask uh
yes i never ask
usually i answer questions 
 no i wou 
 i never i never ask ask 
 i ' ll waiting for the employment
uh an employer to say uh how much uh 
 usually employer will say introduce yourself
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
sometimes
just talk about 
 
 but for teaching jobs 
the salary always the same right 
 yeah 
government rate 
 yes 
 is standard
 
so the best teacher don't don't get more
no 
 don't get more
no 
 
is that bad
shouldn't the best teacher get pay more 
 no 
 but how can you define who who is the
best 
 how can you define best best teachers
 
uhm
that ' s problem
i don't know how would you define
you have to able to i think 
but i i i know in some private school
uh the paying scale is different 
just they count how
maybe in the form five teachers
uh they have to count how many distinction of the
student get
and some extra award will give to teacher
 
but just for the private school
 uhm uhm 
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
uhm
