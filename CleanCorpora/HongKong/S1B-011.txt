good morning we are group eleven and today we are going to
discuss the case in chapter fifteen the npc
""
let  ' s have uh first have a review of the case so as to refresh your
memory   two-words  
""
the northern  the northern petrol chemical company short for npc
was a subsidiary of northern natural national gas which decided to get into
polypropylene production for two reasons
""
first from production  ' s standpoint it was already making
polystyrene which is a precursor of and  one-word  for
polypropylene and therefore it could supply many of the new raw materials for
the product
""
second from market  ' s standpoint polypropylene could  subst 
substitutes for polystyrene which was expected to have depressed sales
because of high benzene prices and possible shortages
""
however there are constraint for npc to enter polypropylene
production mainly due to the lack of technical capability to carry out its
own r and d
""
as a result the npc came came to a decision that they try to find a
firm which it could gain the use of technology
""
it had come through three  it had come through three stages of
decision
""
first it approached the domestic firms in an advanced stage of
copolymer development
""
however it was un uh unsuccessful to reach an agree agreement since
firms wanted a secondary supply source in case of supply problems
""
and npc felt that it was incompatible with its strategies at as it
didn't want to be  shadows  of other
""
besides firms were reluctant to create another competitor by
sharing the technology
""
this lead to their second  the stage of decision to approach
firms abroad but it found that none had fully commercialized advance 
copolymer  production
""
under its third stage of decision npc decide that basf from west
germany offer the best potential since it was and remains one of the giants
among chemical companies
""
furthermore most of its sales were outside of west germany and it
had substantial us investment 
""
on the side of basf it was reluctant for market development of new
products because it had the cash flow problem and it felt that more attention
should be given to its main specialties which were encountering difficulties
""
it finally came to the negotiating  situation that basf was
willing to sell its already developed technology but not willing to continue
copolymer research and share future technology while npc wanted more than the
pilot plant advancement and try to continue be  convince basf to alter its
position to meet npc  ' s original expectation since it was reluctant to carry
out its own r and d
""
after review in the case we now go to question and section
discussion
""
""
uhm we would like to escape question one for discussion later
""
first of all let  ' s have a look on question two
""
what type of agreement and operating forms were in the best
interest of npc and of basf
""
although there are many types of operating forms not all of them
can fulfill the requirement of npc or basf
""
so let  ' s discuss those impossible operating forms for them first
""
""
the first one is franchising it included provision of a trade mark
and continue infusion of necessary in assets
""
besides in a sense the franchiser and franchisee act almost like a
vertically integrated firm because the parties are independent and it produce
part of the product or service that ultimately reaches the consumer
""
 obv  obviously npc and basf are would not going to use
either trade mark
""
moreover they are not going to produce part of product or service
that ultimately reaches the consumer 
""
the second one is management contract
""
it offers a mean through which a firm may use part of its
management personnel to assist a firm in a foreign country in general or
specialized management functions for a specific period of time for a fee
""
besides management contract is established in three types of
situation
""
a the old operation has been  ex  expropriate
""
b a firm is asked to manage a new venture c a foreign firm is
invited in to manage an existing operation more efficiently
""
however the situation of npc and  basf is not any of them
""
and the third one is joint venture
""
it is a kind of share ownership and it requires many resources to
join the two companies
""
although joint venture can be used it is not worthy and not
desirable by both of them
""
nevertheless there are some possible operating forms for them to
choose 
""
the first one is licensing
""
under a licensing agreement a firm  grands  rights to on
intangible property to another firm for a specify period of time and the
licensee ordinarily pays a royalty to the licenser in exchange
""
technology is one of the intangible property
""
in the case basf was willing to sell the technology that it had
developed already so basf prefers acting as a licenser to sell its developed
 alread  developed technology to npc
""
however licensing does not match the strategy of npc
""
npc prefers  one-word  operation more since
 one-word  operation involves a contract for construction
of operating facilities that are  independ  that are transferred for a
fee to the owner when the facilities are already to commit operations
""
in the case npc was willing to invest over one hundred million in
the r and d project to obtain technology but it was not willing to involve in
its own r and d
""
so npc was finding a firm from which it could gain the use of
polypropylene technology by investing in that firm  ' s r and d
""
as a result  one-word  operation would be in the
best interest of npc while licensing would be in the best interest of n basf
 a long pause 
""
""
now let us discuss the question number three
""
in the question it asked what should npc do if basf won't share
technology beyond the pilot plant stage
""
if basf won't share technology beyond the pilot plant stage with
npc there are several ways that npc can do in order to gain the high
technology
""
even it is quite a difficult task npc can give up the chance of
cooperation with basf and try to find another new partner that are willing to
compromise with npc under certain agreement
""
in order to have the development of polypropylene productions
assuming that npc cannot  finding  a new partner in a short period of
time
""
there are something npc can do in order to get more familiarized of
the technology of polypropylene
""
firstly it can establish company unit so as to monitor general and
technical conference in order to get more information
""
third npc can establish operational link with the individual and
operation that are apparently need the field of polypropylene production
since it will help a lot to obtain important and valuable information about
the technology that npc needs
""
fourthly npc can develop formal link with those academic and other
research organization at home and aboard so as to get the updated data and
innovation about the product of polypropylene
""
also npc can increase feasibility through participation in trade
affair trade fairs and contact with technical consultant
""
through this way more related firm can know the real need of npc in
case there is some appropriate partners appeared in r and d development npc
can be quickly informed
""
from second to fifth point they are more likely to be the effort of
npc inviting outside support in order to become more  knowle 
knowledgeable in the development of polypropylene production
""
but what happen if npc cannot find a partner even in a long period
of time in order to  to have in order to avoid the burden delay of market
entry
""
we suggest only way left for npc is to carry out of r and d by
itself
""
however as we all know that even though npc is willing to invest
over one hundred million in r and d it lacked the technical  ca 
ability in order to overcome this crucial problem
""
what npc can do is to gain the assistance of those expert who are
familiarized in the technology of what npc needed
""
npc can employ these expert by head-hunting  from those firm who
are producing polypropylene now  a long pause 
""
""
now let  ' s come to the question four
""
what  weaks  have the firms already incurred by going to
explore in their discussions
""
first of all their weaknesses are exposed
""
for npc its weaknesses are it had no advanced technology in
polypropylene and it had difficulties in carrying out its own r and d since
it would greatly delay market entry and mean risking legal complications
""
for basf its weaknesses are it had no growth in its products in
west german market it had difficulties in infusing german funds into us
operations
""
cash flow problems make it difficult to commit market development
of new products and its main specialties were encountering difficulties
""
moreover their strategies are exposed
""
on the side of npc it would further develop copolymer in us market
because it is forecast there would be a rapid growth rate in the demand of
polypropylene
""
it would further in  rose  for sales provided that it
continue performance and cost effectiveness were improved by the means of r
and d
""
and the finally it would invest over one hundred million in r and d
for polypropylene 
""
on the side of basf it would concentrate in products it had
developed and it would not make a commitment to continue copolymer research
""
in addition npc face a risk back itself that is if it could not
successfully find a firm from which it could gain the use of polypropylene
technology on acceptable terms it would waste its time and money and further
delay the market entry  a long pause 
""
""
now in question number five it asks npc was thinking to obtain
technology how might a search process have differed if npc had been trying to
sell a technology
""
there are quite a number of big differences for npc between 
seeking  so obtain technology and trying to sell a technology
""
first for  seeking  technology npc search firm from proximal
to distal as we all know npc tries to find an appropriate firm in its
domestic area first that is in united states like the example of hercules and
rexene division et cetera
""
after after having exhausted domestic possibility npc turned abroad
and find some company like those in japan belgium italy and west germany
""
all these countries that other  coun  all these firms in 
that country are further away from npc
""
they are the second choice of npc
""
it can be explained that npc want to have a more closely located
firm in order to ask for more technical assistance after the buying of
technology
""
on the contrary if npc try to sell technology it may rather prefer
to choose  some company from distal to proximal so as to decrease the
threat of competition
""
also before selling npc must pay more attention to see whether the
buyer will focus on different market or the same market
""
if the buyer target for the same market it is unlikely for the npc
to sell its technology for an enemy that will create threat against npc  ' s
own advantage in the market
""
second when  seeking  technology npc will search from
companies that obtain most advanced to those have less advanced technology
""
in the real situation npc first found hercules which must have very
professional knowledge in polypropylene technology since it dominate the
entire polypropylene market
""
after the fail of approaching those firm had higher technology then
npc approach other firms that were believed to have a bigger lag between
product development and commercial introduction of the products
""
in other words their technology will be less suitable for the need
of npc
""
if npc try to sell a technology the main concern of npc will be the
identification of technology its own technologies
""
if it has advanced technology it can try to find an appropriate
buyers from a more developed country
""
on the other hand if it want to sell less advanced technology it
has to target for a buyer from a developing country since in those developing
country the development of technology are still starting at the very
beginning
""
thus what their need may be from less advanced rather than those
advanced technology
""
to sum up the primary concern of npc is to provide suitable
technology to its target buyer  a long pause 
""
""
let  ' s come to the part of discussion
""
we will discuss the question number one
""
question is  how likely is this that the two firms will come to
a mutual agreement
""
any idea 
""
anyone has opinions about the question  a long pause 
 several words 
""
there are really points in a text that you  ' ll discover something
that uh for for stand for the point  ands  not stand for reaching
agreement and   several words 
""
if no idea i  ' ll call up some groups 
""
any volunteer   several words   a long
pause 
""
let  ' s have  group three
""
 group three
""
""
i don't think   that the 
""
""
 group three   are you group three
""
 yes
""
""
uh uh   i 
""
""
 uh   would you  pl  it please speak louder
""
""
i don't think that uh two groups will have uhm  mu 
mutual agreement uhm at the time being because uhm it is unnecessary for basf
to uhm invest in the uhm npc to have to operate with them because they have a
lot of problems to cope with
""
and   one-word  uh it cannot uhm see what uh
what the gain for the firm is not uhm so obvious because uhm  it has to
invest a lot of money in the research first  and  uhm  i think if
uh  uh basf is uh really in the pointed uhm to spend in the to see the
profit for its own firm first so uhm i don't think they will have a mutual
""
""
uhm uhm  you think that no agreement will be reached
""
""
uhm at the time being
""
""
any other opinion
