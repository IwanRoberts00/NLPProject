 all is fair in love and war  wrong the civilized world accepts some things can be done and some things not even in war the geneva convention of nineteen twenty five makes that perfectly clear the war crimes tribunal also makes the same point last week two auction houses sold four relics looted hundred and forty years ago from the summer palace in beijing the auctions angered the chinese people all over the world and embarrassed other peoples too they viewed the sale in the former british colony of hong kong as a deliberate provocation that also jacked up prices i ' m not here to talk much about the business sense of the auctions or the insensitivity of the auctioneers they said that the auctions were commercial and not political wrong trafficking in relics taken in war is not only commercial but also political and immoral the auctions reminded us of the humiliation our ancestors had endured in the worst time in chinese history these sales were an insult to injury we will never forget even as we try to forgive my job as a legislator is to consider laws to prevent the trade in loots obtained in war however any such law has to be practical and specific not unreasonable and broad any such law must observe international treaties and conventions as well as our constitution the basic law and any such law must properly protect private properties and hong kong as a heritage trade center basic law article hundred and fifty three empowers hong kong to legislate against some acts such as auctions of looted relics hong kong is a party to two treaties the nineteen fifty four hague convention and the nineteen ninety five unidroit convention the conventions seek to protect cultural properties taken in wartime any law that legislators consider must observe the terms of those treaties and also those that govern unesco a united nations agency and in line with the chinese national policy against traffic in wartime loot no one here advocates confiscating all relics in hong kong where there ' s a market for heritage items to legislate against the keeping of these relics would threaten private property and drive overseas items that we would like to see kept on chinese soil today many heritage items are held on the mainland in hong kong macao and taiwan these don't concern us in law what does is the wartime loot that got away from china and is making its way back through auctions any law that legislators enact must distinguish relics owned by collectors and those seized in foreign wars of aggression a lot of the wartime loot has changed hands many times over the years i propose that we put everyone ' s mind at ease we can do that by coming up with a crystal definition of wartime loot which alone is subject to legal control on trafficking and protection for private property we must encourage collectors who possess such loot to return these assets and receive equitable compensation if they cannot determine a price or cannot settle with those wanting to restore the relics to the country by then an auction might be necessary however i would strongly suggest that the sar government should not allow such an auction to take place here hong kong has the antiquities and monuments board which has experts drawn from the universities the board tries mainly to protect landmarks from destruction the government may consider widening the board ' s mandate to identify and safeguard national and hong kong sr heritage treasures ideally foreign governments whose armies long ago took the loot should buy back the items and return these objects to the chinese nation as a gesture the chinese people would appreciate the offer the united kingdom owns a heap of loot from its many imperial wars the british museum houses some exhibits which rightly belong to other peoples among these are the elgin marbles that the greeks have claimed against britain for more than a century britain ' s prime minister tony blair says his country is modern democratic and responsible i would like to think that mr blair is a man of his word and that his government should return the loot and compensate the loot ' s owners from his government treasury he can buy a lot of goodwill for his country and a peace of mind for the new generation of britons who wish to bid farewell to their imperial past i ' m also realistic i know it might take some time for the british government to act on mr blair ' s conscience i believe the chinese government chinese companies and the chinese people are willing to compensate the owners of the loot we ' re against taking back by force what belong to our nation from those who own things that others had taken out of china by force let me emphasize we ' re against putting the relics to auctions that hurt the feelings of all chinese who simply want to restore their heritage and who don't want to be taunted i wonder whether auction houses ever considering selling in new york or jerusalem loot that nazis took from the jews in the holocaust i doubt they would dare because international law and international opinion would not allow such a sale to take place the jewish people are right to demand the return of all the loot and also also the deposits some swiss banks have kept from holocaust victims the jews of today have to do this in memory of their own brothers and sisters fathers and mothers i applaud their endeavor for they have set a brave example for other victims of aggression the chinese ask for similar respect for our own kind we share the disgust at the auctions that were placed and also timed to cause the chinese greatest emotional pain we have a duty therefore to stop the traffic of wartime loot in hong kong i don't mean just wartime loot taken from the chinese but from all peoples this is the mark of our civilization even when the auction houses act uncivilized maybe the concept is hard to understand for some whose countries have not experienced loss in natural treasures to foreign aggression in the past few centuries britain was last conquered a thousand years ago china suffered foreign aggression even until recently the british people remember their sacrifices they keep the bombed out ruins in coventry as a monument we the chinese keep the summer palace as rubble to remind ourselves of our grief and shame we swear on the graves of our ancestors that history must never repeat itself today at last the chinese nation is strong and in strength we don't want our old wounds reopened the last thing we need is to have hong kong be a scar to the chinese people now and the way it had been for more than hundred and fifty years  dear susan the summer was very hot in hong kong so was the political atmosphere after the summer holidays school will resume as a teacher you have already been planning for the new term for some time i guess you must have been very busy the second election to legislative council of the sar will be held next sunday that is the tenth september would you discuss this with your students after the summer term begins in the past few months we have been preoccupied with the concerns for possible interference in academic freedom right of abode of the mainlanders rights of the university students in organizing peaceful strikes and demonstrations and quality of our legislative representatives most of these issues represented an underlying skepticism of the hong kong people fearing that the political authority has an in  invisible hand to extend the executive power yet undermine the degree of freedoms that we have been enjoying public debates on these issues would have both a direct and indirect impact on our choice during the legislative election during the electoral campaigns policy issues are seldom discussed rather personal image and political stance of the candidates are emphasized many candidates have to admit openly that they do not support the chief executive in fact the voters in hong kong increasingly incline to vote for the opposition rather than the so-called pro-government candidates  many young people very confused why and how does the culture of opposition develop to what extent does it affect voters ' decision in the electoral processes i guess it is the best opportunity for you to discuss with your students what the legislative council does and what are we voting for the major job of the legislators is to legislate all of the bills proposed by the government must be passed by the three readings of the legislative council before it can be implemented legally in our legislative system it is difficult if not impossible for legislative members to initiate a bill to be passed in the council constitutionally they are not allowed to initiate bills which have financial implications or policy implications in other words they cannot initiate a policy in the form of a bill they cannot change government policies by passing decisions on the re-allocation of the financial resources ultimately the major legislative function of the council is to pass to amend or to reject the government bills the weapon of the council is to veto government bills or turn down the requests for financial appropriation by the executive government in order to ensure that the legislators would pass the bills or the financial requests officials have to persuade the elected representatives and their parties to accept government proposals bargaining and compromise may be the result after all our legislative council does not exercise a genuine legislative power but a veto power the legislative council can always say no to the bills proposed by the government the hong kong legislative council plays a much strongering  monitoring role rather than legislative and policymaking role apart from the legislative and financial functions mentioned in the above the legislators could also initiate motion for debates any motions which are passed by the legislative council however merely constitute a political pressure or embarrassment government has no obligation to execute the views of the legislative representatives decided in the motion debates in addition to motion debates the legislators could also scrutinize public expenditure through the public accounts committee and give suggestions to government policies and consultative papers through the panels moreover the legislators can also use the question times to reveal administrative flaws monitor policy progress and ask government to provide more information for public consumption the system of effective monitoring is very expensive because the executive authorities are often required to compile information and respond to critical questions to the satisfactions of the legislators after all our elected legislators do not have to be responsible for policy failures similarly they do not gain credit based on policy success they are not elected to govern society but oppose to the government our elected representatives basically gain support by fighting against the executive authority what they believe they should do is to fight for the disadvantaged and grassroots what we need however are those people who are able to make policy to represent public interest but we only produce representatives who can at most stop the executive from not making any policy against the public interest we cannot elect representatives to make policies on our behalf and provide us with the leadership to consider alternative blueprints for hong kong ' s long-term development therefore politicians can easily position themselves by claiming to represent the interests of a sector or a class those who claim to stand for public interest in a general sense are difficult to position themselves because they never have the opportunity to become responsible for a policy whether successful or failed the system is unsatisfactory because it only produces opposition and thus encourages the development of a culture of opposition hong kong has developed a strong image internationally in that it always stands against authority which virtually includes standing against power and oligarchs but before we cast our vote next week we should also rationally consider a few points first hong kong is an economic and international city while we should have an effective monitoring system we should also maintain the system which encourages free economic opportunity and accumulation of wealth second we do not merely wish the legislative representatives to purely criticize vocally against the government but expect them to work with the executive authorities in the best interest of hong kong especially economic growth and sustainable development third the existing system is unsatisfactory as citizens we should have the opportunity to consider a few alternatives which suit us most what we need is an open and rational process of discussions allowing us to assess the pros and cons of each option available to us it seems that we still lack the atmosphere to do so now finally we should learn from our young people would you share with me the views of your students after you have discussed with them in the new term wish you well then jane
