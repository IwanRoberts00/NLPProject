""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
good uh 
""
talk   to  me don't hang up
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
""
okay so uhm what are taking up here
""
okay this is right home you have these uhm  insurance  
 one word   life uh whatever but is not making any
money right now
""
this been insurance the only insurance policy i had   my
life yeah  okay
""
this this uh yeah yeah
""
what  ' s this 
""
they are the latest statement  a long pause 
""
""
 yes  
""
 i see i see  
""
it scores million us dollars uh some insurance   so 
""
""
 yeah  
""
so every month i put into that uhm now is about thousand something
dollars  a long pause 
""
""
 insurance to each  uh a chop  one hundred usually
""
""
now uh i think uh you are making one hundred   ninety
ninety  seven  yeah yeah 
""
""
 yes yes insurance up to  
""
  eight  hundred eight eight uh hundred or whatever or
they are mention in
""
""
 ninety  
""
uhm uhm
""
""
oh to seventy two years old 
""
no ninety eight i see
""
and uh so so you have a permanent disability insurance which is up
to age sixty five
""
""
okay
""
""
life in basic life insurance up to ninety eight and it is a a
investment link insurance   policy  where they would apart from
charging you all the the the policy   charges  and cost of
insurance they would basically invest the rest    all the in in
those  two fund okay
  yes  
""
 yeah  
""
 in those two funds  
""
which uh not make any money
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
not loss a lot of money
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
so this is the  the is where i stuck now uhm it  ' s no point
to surrender the policy   because i just  loss all the money
""
""
 i don't know  
""
don't do that i mean   uhm uhm  i  ' m usually i mean
without without going through any details of your your needs okay i would
seldom advise okay     any anybody to give up the policy
because insurance policy takes time     to cumulate okay and
of course you need okay the the more difficult situation you are in the more
coverage you need
""
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 okay  
""
right now   it  ' s true uh ha 
""
""
 right right and then   and then and that  ' s that  ' s
that  ' s cause the problem okay because usually when people are poorly usually
have  good life      on top of own policies
""
so your work cover okay your   your  your your your
insurance needs are well covered all by the company and then by the  
  by the by yourself   okay  but once you you leave
employment for some time then then the whole thing change okay because that
part of the lot life is gone
""
but then it  ' s the time you need it more
""
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
i know i   know 
""
but now i don't think at any other insurance
""
""
 yeah  
""
yes   yes 
""
""
 so   i  ' m looking at    two words
 
""
""
 some medical   medical insurance    log
  right
""
yeah because because when you are uh health when you when you are
working with large company they will definitely have certain   degree
of uh  of health insurance   medical  insurance so right
and and
""
yeah it  ' s that that that  ' s the problem that most of us have
today
""
when we employ we seldom think think about
""
""
 yeah  
""
 it  ' s something yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
and as one unemploy then   it  ' s time 
""
""
 or changing   employment   okay  in
and you may have to settle with different terms    
""
you may in the you may have sometimes you may have to settle for
lower lower medical term for example i mean this  fat  those are
usually not the key elements   you consider  when you
considering an employment okay
""
if you can even if you can pick the choose okay   you
 won't okay you won't okay you won't take this as the  fir  uh
first   priority  but then it it it just changes i mean it just
reduces your your your quality of life or your quality of when you are when
you  si  when you   are  contributing a sick okay is that
you are going to a private ward you may have to share a single ward with the
sars   patient 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
 oh   imprison no imprisonment well hospital yeah
will be good one
""
""
okay so
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
oh okay
""
introduce to you
""
wilma komala    and uh  quinine tam
 
""
 uh ha hi   
""
""
hello   quinine  several words  
 
""
 nice to meet you    chinese conversation 
""
uh okay  chinese conversation  
""
""
 chinese conversation 
""
""
okay  several words  is just for investment
not for insurance
""
  that was  the   objective  of this 
po    just policy and they say  oh by the way you can get
insurance okay   okay 
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 oh yes   yes
""
""
so
""
""
and it  ' s investing into two funds is okay uh just looking
the name it will quite uh wouldn't wouldn't be able know exactly what the
fund are like
""
""
uhm   it was  capital  growth and global
opportunity   and  it was supposed to be like united states low
risk fund
 
""
 they were growth fund they were  
""
 yeah   
""
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm
 
""
are   you sure  
""
""
 was   was
 
""
i think this is  stock stock fund   or not not uh
 not uh bonds uh ha
""
  bond  fund something    investment
 stocks uh ha 
""
""
 some part was stock  
""
 uhm  
""
 it was a mixture  
""
yeah some stocks some bonds it was like uh is it bit like a
neutral uh like the  gei gam   these cantonese words refer
to fund  like have uh uhm
""
""
 two words  some of this yeah some 
 some small   inform  some information here   
   it  ' s 
""
capital growth usually would be equity   base 
""
so the concept is uh looking at   little  bit growth
   yeah  
""
and then the other one is a    is a global opportunity
 fund
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 uh ha  
 
""
  to grow    
""
""
 equity 
 
""
  two words  equity oh  
""
 uh   
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 i think not low risk   
""
""
it was uhm when i bought it at the time it was low risk
 
""
oh  chinese conversation  
""
""
yeah well  two words 
 
""
 chinese conversation  
""
""
 chinese conversation 
""
just leave it cause i need money
 
""
 chinese conversation  
""
""
 chinese conversation 
""
""
twenty us dollars a a year so it would be uh  
thousand six  but  hundred and sixty us five thousand thousand a bit
over a   thousand  one thousand two hundred  a long pause
""
""
are this capital growth fund is not right percent capital based
 
""
 installment premium  one word  two
hundred   
""
""
 yeah  
""
uh some bonds
""
""
some bonds   okay   okay   there  ' s
been bond 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
  two chinese words   
""
 chinese conversation  
""
""
 chinese conversation 
""
""
the other one is a the other is global opportunity assurance
equity   base  are they  
""
""
 is it uh    one word equity base yeah
""
""
""
so so so uhm so uhm that so not surprisingly the most 
 of  uh i mean it  ' s large equity base the last two years has keep
down a bit but funds take a   long time  to to   to
reach  the sea there   and and  the potential of of uh the
game also
""
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah i know  
""
 i know  
""
 that uhm  
""
i know i understand that but   it is  like uh the
time
""
  is it  depressing  that is you  say that uhm
""
""
 yeah  
""
 perhaps  several words   
""
 wi  wilma at the moment is working for hong kong
university in a in a language study   uh linguistic project 
""
""
 linguistics yeah  
""
uh   ha 
 
""
 uh   english project 
""
""
yes english department right
""
""
yeah
""
okay so basically what i would be looking for now would be like
sort of health medical   coverage  something like   that
""
""
uhm okay i don't have any i don't think     and uh
another side of it like uhm home insurance
""
""
 coverage  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm okay okay okay good
""
""
so uhm  it those  are the two main   things 
""
for an uhm okay the health medical be life get for myself and my
husband
""
""
 yeah  
""
good
""
""
 three words 
""
""
good okay
""
need your your your child is he here
""
""
he  ' s in the states
""
""
he  ' s in the states right
""
he is  one word  university   student
right 
""
""
 yeah   he  ' s   got  coverage over
  there 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah   yeah i i think i think  manner  i
think university none   mandatory  mandatory insurance coverage
   po   uh policy
""
""
 mandatory  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
so i don't think i need to cover him on on   health or uhm
""
""
""
 yeah yeah and   since he  ' s going to university
you   basically   si  you basically   join 
on your fund to suppose it  ' s education already you you   don't 
i mean there  ' s no need to think further for his
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
no he  ' s got this like that
""
""
if you get it on if you   if you if you retire you
get uh  you you get something return okay   if  you retire
 
""
 two hundred fifty thousand   
""
""
 yeah  
""
oh that  ' s   why i  ' m looking  at uhm hopefully i  ' ll
get a good return when i retire which is not   tomorrow so the so uhm
something like uh   ten fifteen years you know can't be worse
""
""
 hopefully hopefully  
 
""
 hopefully yeah yeah
""
it  ' s the long term investment anyway   
""
""
this is the latest statement right
""
""
oh that was uhm   a year 
""
""
 others  
 a year   ago 
 
""
 uh   uhm yeah 
""
""
yeah about a year ago
""
i should get another one since  but it looks  one word
""
""
so depressed
 
""
so depressed 
""
you select the fund by yourself or the    hong kong
 bank suggest you   to select this  
""
""
 yeah uhm  
""
 they they suggest   they say okay these are and i
say i don't want to as it i don't mind putting some in uh uhm faster growth
higher risk but i want   something  more stable so this is the
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
""
""
and it  ' s all is global like uh the risk is spread around the
world
""
""
yes i mean it is one   one  one one uh element
of function did they because they ask spread it out more than than when you
investing on your own   occasion 
""
so usually they they just spread the risk and therefore the result
in a lower risk
 
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yeah
""
""
yes
""
and then of course in uh now entire world equity market has gone
or high risk high high  two words  in the last two years
so so wherever you   are you have diversify  out of that 
 risk 
""
""
 it doesn't matter  
""
  doesn't   matter just like 
 
""
uhm is it  true  
""
""
uh ha yeah
 
""
i had  chop  down some rules out
""
is it running down
""
price  ' s going down 
""
""
yeah
 
""
yes 
""
""
i know i know i know  several words 
 
""
 chinese words  
""
""
i know i know   because   several words
 investment 
 
""

""
""

""
 several words 
""
this is life insurance uh plus the investment 
""
""
yeah
 
""
yes uh    several words   
""
""
 uh no no no uhm actually it was another   an
earlier policy that i got that in ninety  six i think
""
""
uh so you convert that into
""
""
and then i was they change the policy uhm i don't know uhm
  something  life to   uhm  to the  
civilized the
""
they change the name and then  the whole policy transmit over
 
""

""

traditional type of life insurance right
 
""

""
""

""
 uhm   uhm
 
""
yeah 
""
""

""
oh of course saving protection plus    
""
yeah that  ' s all i want    to  old policy 
""
""
 okay  
 
""
 oh target  prove    if fifty three years at
age hundred 
""
""
uhm
 
""
it takes a long time to get back your money
""
  oh it is okay  
""
""
 oh yeah  
""
i don't quite understand that that  ' s why you know like yup
""
oh this is the way that  ' s always done
""
okay fine
 
""
 chinese conversation  
""
""
yes it is    three words  okay 
 
""
 yes  
""
we also have this   product  uh ha    uh
ha     uh  ha
""
  you have  the protection amount and then the
others invest uh ha     uh in the unique fund 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yes  
""
 in main  
""
""
 yeah  
""
right
 
""
 chinese conversation  
""
""
 chinese conversation 
""
oh i see this one uhm  two words   
latest statement   yih lihng lihng yat ji   the
meaning of these cantonese words is from two thousand and one to  well
okay  four words    this  is after 
gau   this cantonese word refers to nine  uh nine eleven
 
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 two words     two words
  one year 
""
""
 so 
""
""
 one   one one thing one thing they they  
one 
 
""
 you   can change the fund actually you can 
""
""
yeah
 
""
uh 
""
""
you change into like a stable growth fund    
manageable  fund uh 
 
""
 yes uh like seventy percent   in bond funds and
thirty percent   in  equity fund
""
it  ' s much better   you know
""
i think  then uh ha 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 okay
""
so  
""
""
uh one of the i don't know i don't know whether they  ' ve uh
 or  one word  has 
""
i don't know  whether hong 
 
""
 you don't have to do uh  
""
 switching  
""
you don't have to do the switching
""
the new money you can uh invest in other funds   uh
""
don't do  switching because let it going up before you sell
  okay  
""
""
 uh  mihng baahk   the meaning of these
cantonese words is understand  okay okay  
""
 okay  
""
okay   i see 
 
""
 just stick   this uh ha and uh new money  
come  to the bank and then to   another fund  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 but one   one of the problem i   notice
here 
 
""
 this is   my   suggestion  
""
""
 uhm 
""
""
 yeah  
""
one of the problem i notice here is that this policy only only has
the   sufficient four funds four funds  so so   it it
 may okay it may make it a bit  di  more difficult to sort of
spread out your     your portfolio yeah    
yeah unlike unlike the uh aia situation
""
they actually have sixteen   fund like  our own 
 and  the fund are actually quite well defined
""
  okay  so we have like very stable fund like fixed
income fund    also     investment to into 
into uh saving deposits bank  deposits for fixed   uh 
interest rate okay so those those are quite stably uh increase increasing
  and then  we have uh income bond fluctuating bond only so
so quite well    actually  and  and and i think among
the funds some of them are actually quite well managed
""
you have learned fund we have uh equity fund   which is
 quite well to our   well  manage but this one is
actually  i think it  ' s a bit too tight maybe okay after two years they
may increase a few uh a few selections
 
""
 oh we have four funds to select  
""
 oh  
""
""
 to invest  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 oh okay  
 
""
 uhm  
""
""
 okay  
""
 uhm uhm 
 
""
 yes fixed    income fund is going up uh during
these two  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right right  
""
 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
right i have to uhm look at it    selection  
""
""
 but they   only rely on the hong kong bank uh
resources
