hi
television broadcast it in known to us as tvb has uh
an associated company tvbi and uh the
the job of that company is to sell and uh sell to new markets and
uh expand existing market for chinese language tv programming
uhm the general manager of tvbi is s k fung
and i have him on the line now
hello s k 
hello rhonda
how are you
 good evening
 
 i ' m 
i ' m good
thanks for for joining us 
you ' re welcome
 
uhm what programming are you selling in the region 
uhm mainly the drama and tele features that tvb
produces
uhm we now we license these programmes to other tv stations in
southeast asia as well as uh distribute it in the the form of video
cassette for home viewing
 
how many hours of programming a year do you distribute 
oh i think we distribute over thousand hours of these drama
and tele features a year
 
wow that ' s that ' s quite a lot
is that all uhm uh has they all been broadcasted on tvb in
hong kong 
most of them have
but we also produce a certain drama and and uh uh product that are
distributed in video form for oversea market that have not broadcasted on tvb
 
right
uhm what about market outside of asia 
we do that too
we distribute our programmes uh mainly to where there are asian
communities including chinese uh and a number of other asian minority groups
uh for which we have made uh other language version of our
programmes uh 
 
 what languages s k 
uh they include the vietnamese the mandarin cantonese uh
thai cambodian korean malay and then more
even more recently you know for the last two years we ' ve been uh
experimenting with uh english one- word spanish
 one-word version to our products for european and uh
latin american market
 
 uh 
right
uhm uh how do you sell it
i mean who do you uh to go knocking on the doors of all the tv
stations 
 laughs 
yes
we do a little bit of that too
actually for for the asian communities we distribute mainly to
established channels which mean that we sell packages of programme every
year to to the created licensee that we have uh built up relations with over
the years
and many of these operator either change their video
stores or they license to uh video dealers
say in the chinatown of uh the usa uh canada or the uk et cetera
 that ' s one channel distribution for the uh the
the european clan or the american clans these are
the would be the quotation uh communities
then uh we distribute soap uh a number of uh uh means of 
one-word 
uh we distribute to appointed distributors who have more programme
to sell to these clans that we do
because we will be
i supposed uh really uh one of these suppliers of uh 
two-words programme
because they would be the main stream quotation audience
that would be one type of channel so we distribute so we distribute
the 
or we would uh uh sell as a several you know tv market like mid
 tv in one-word or mid home and uh net tv
in the the us
we accept that our products to groups and then we talk to
buyers to combine 
and we also write to certain stations and send them catalogue of
our products
or we drop in and call on these stations
so it ' s a mixture of methods
 
 uhm 
right
you you uhm said you distribute a lot of a lot of dramas
is there uh uh uh description of what is the most popular product
uh yeah a specific description of what is the most popular product
to you uhm market 
uh it varies a bit uh for uh different countries and even
within countries sometimes for uh different audiences
say for instance uh for the uh chinese community that we sell to uh
overseas uh whether distanced southeast asia or say in uh advanced the
chinese communities in europe and in north america
they typically uh would enjoy more of uh the drama that are popular
in hong kong
because i think their taste are very similar 
whereas for uh some asian communities say for for example korea 
thailand or uh vietnam
then uh they prefer our costume uh kung fu type the costume uh
action type drama
they ' re supposed to be uhm more modern costume type drama
 
right 
and then for uh the western audiences that we are
beginning just beginning to sell to
and we are are beginning to opening uh open up more to them
uh i think that the our tele features which are movie
 link products that are more action orientated
they tend to be preferred
because a they are shorter rather than our long serial drama
so it ' s easier for a a quotation audience to sort of try
and get to enjoy it
secondly i guess action transcend dialogues
so the more action type the uh movie link features tend to
be preferred for these audiences
so varies quite a bit you know
it varies from the very traditional chinese to the other ethnic
 asians to the sort of quotation is to which pro 
which of our programme are preferred
 
right
uhm what uhm what ' s the most popular programme you ever
sold 
i think it is hard to uh quantify exactly like that
because for most of our major market we distribute in a
package which means that we don't sell just one single 
drama or one single movie
we would sell typically say a package for a given year
so many hundred hours of our programme and then we would we
send them
uh uh we send a licensee master tape of each of these uh programme
and then they in term then sort of duplicated locally and then
distributed to video shops
so it is a bit hard for us to say exactly which is the most popular
 but i would think that buy enlarge uh
among the non cantonese speaking market
i would say that our costume uh kung fu type drama tend to
be more popular
the the the one set were rewritten from sort of classic kung fu
novels that were written uh uh uh years ago tend to more popular 
 
and among the cantonese speaking market whereas i think that they
tend to be closer to hong kong taste
so those tend to be more the the melodramatic type drama
the soap opera type drama uh tend to be more popular
 
 alright 
 uh ha 
 right 
 right 
right
well s k uhm that ' s uh that ' s all we ' re going to have time for
this time
but i ' d like to talk to you again about uh your uhm animation
project 
so uh perhaps uh we can talk again in another few weeks 
 alright 
thanks very much 
 sure 
 sure
thank you 
 okay thank you rhonda
 
s k fung who is general manager of tvbi 
 
good evening and welcome to newsline
my name is maureen boyd
a main subject tonight is labour
the decision to import nearly fifteen thousand foreign workers
the brain drain and other related issues
we join tonight by the secretary for education and manpower 
yeung kai yin
then after the break we ' ll be joined by labour leader lee cheuk
yan and then by martin barrow chairman of the hong kong tourist association
but first let ' s talk with t l tsim about some of the events of
the week
t l
 one-word lady lily tang is now a baroness
 and she would give her seat in the house of lords
there were other honours for hong kong citizen
but one person who didn't get a honour despite prediction to the
contrary was the attorney-general jamie matthew
t l how importance honours system in a colony
and i ' m going to one-word on this by saying
that some seats uh may hold part they grew by the royalty of
hong kong people to the british government 
 yes 
no i don't think that ' s true
i have said on many government committees myself
i think people reserve on these committees do so
because they want to be able to contribute to uhm policy
meeting matters
and uh i don't think 
well perhaps there is the hon one here and there who 
who are are serving
because uh they think at the end of it they will get a a a a
 an nbe or obe
but but most of us are just glad to be there
however this syst system may change in the future 
uh 
 
 would anyone miss it 
yes i supposed some people may miss it
uh it it ' s nice to be known as an obe
for instance one of my friends just got one
and i haven't talk to him about it yet
but i ' m sure it ' s gone down very well
 
okay
now derek davis is the former editor of the fareast
economic review
and really institute and journalistic cycle right
 in hong kong has left the colony
but before he left he has some uhm parking shot about the
governor the chinese and some pretty one-word 
predictions about the future
he compare hong kong to a sandwich with the one-word
 making the bread on one side
the unskilled labour making the bread on the other
and the ham which is the middle class is disappearing
how do you react to that 
well i supposed i ' m part of the ham
and these lines are getting thinner
but uh this is not to say these lines cannot be replaced
we may have yuan nan ham from china before too long
but i ' m going to miss derek
he ' s always provocative opinionated but very interesting
 
okay let ' s welcome our guest now yeung kai yin
i just mention that our main topic is labour
but since you are the uh secretary for educational and manpower
maybe we can just squeeze in uh a couple of quick questions about
education
and first is that no chinese history after nineteen forty
nine is being taught in the schools
so what kind of preparation is that for young people facing
nineteen ninety seven 
i don't expect that question uhm 
but i think the curriculum development committee must be looking
into this uhm uh uhm in into this subject
history is always difficult to to construct as as a subject to
be taught in schools
and anything as recent as forty years ago need a great deal of
care care and handling
it depends also on the avail a availability of textbooks
and constant teachers
and if you go to europe for example i mean in france uhm 
some history texts stop fu stop short at the first empire
uh but as i said earlier the curriculum development committee
is doing something about this 
 
 are you going to take personal interest in
 two- words 
no as far as history is concern but as far as uh the uh
civic education curriculum said that this is concern
i know that the education department has done quite a bit uh
in uhm reorientating uhm subject 
so it ' s to bring the hong kong china relationship more into
focus
i know they ' ve done that into work that 
 
 into line or into focus
into no not into line
we uhm into focus
because we are concern with in passing fact on if on
an unbiased bases
one one of the things which you ' ve uhm changed is this
business of political education in schools
uh there ' s an audience which said this is uhm not
to be done
and the audience they expect to the end nineteen fifty
two
we ' re going to change that now
uh is this part of the grand scheme to change things before
nineteen ninety seven
no it isn't really that
the education recent education amended bill that are introduced
to the legislative council seeks to remove from the education 
audience 
all provisions prohibiting political activities and political
teaching in schools
these provisions are one-word 
they go back to the to the late forties nineteen fifties
you know no no longer relevant to our circumstances
we don't think that the teaching of politics in schools is is
necessarily a bad thing
we welcome it so long as the teaching is unbiased and
 that is as difficult as teaching history if am
i say so
because i ' m a student of politics 
and it is not easy to come up with a piece of writing which
is not bias in some way
uh either for or against a capital society
either for or against socialism
 uhm 
well uh i think you will find that uh we will be introducing uh
into the amending legislation of provision which en enables the
government to regulate uh uhm political teaching
uh and to as you said the guideline
now the principles under the main principle underline these
guidelines is that the teaching of the fact involved of a certain
political system whatever it maybe
uh present a true story a factual account and shows both
sides of the picture
 
oh oh we ' ll watching for that
let ' s change to the labour scene
uhm the unions in a labour of movement to against importing 
foreign workers
business interest says they need it a hundred
and fifty thou a hundred and fifty thousand
one of the figures quoted uh foreign workers just to code
now you are the government is a author
it ' s import fourteen thousand seven hundred workers surely that ' s
a compromise
it ' s going to uh sacrifice no one 
well it it ' s uh it ' s not necessary a compromise
we look at actual voluntarily reported vacancy
these drop from something like seventy odd thousand last
year to about sixty four thousand a few months ago
now within the conscious to set decision and set to
answer
we ' ve already got the skills for importing technicians and
craftsmen
we ' ve taken the conscious decision to renew that quota at about
three thousand
as it happens the ratio of vacancy reported vacancy at the level
of basic operatives
it ' s about three point four times that ' s of reported vacancy is
that the level of technicians
and if you multiply three thousand by three and three point four
times it happens to be about ten thousand
well legislative councillor tam wing chung who represents two
 of the worker constituencies would say that that way of dealing with
the figures is uh full of hopes
he said uhm for instance in in a piece one-word
 academic journal he said one the first quota was under
utilized last year 
two you you shouldn't just multiply that by three point four
because number of workers uhm may not in fact equate so needly
 into that particular pigeon hole
and he said unemployment been rising
it ' s now closer to one point eight percent
and he said unlike other societies hong kong cannot live with
a three percent unemployment for long
what do you say to that
i say several things to
first informal no scheme of this sort can ever claim a scientific
position
but at least there is a fair amount of logic behind that
i think we are reflecting a quota attend our 
one-word quota which bears some resemblance to the level of
vacancy between basic operatives and technicians uh workers at a higher level
of skill
uh it is a cruel estimate no one pretends that it is
either uh uh uh uhm absolutely right or precise
but then for scheme of the sort which we are not aiming at
the precise estimate
 
you are called in a paper it say you didn't expect the scheme to
significantly drag down wages for local workers
but it isn't that the point that local workers don't want to see
any reduction of their wages
they want a chance to share hong kong prosperity 
no this is precisely the point
it past scheme in the past we have not
we have fail to give any guidance to employers about the level
of the going wage
what we are now doing is to publish uhm the medium
wage call it average wages which the census and statistics department uh
surveys and publishes twice a year
now we ' re saying to potential em uh employers
if you are not going to offer wage at or above this level forget
it
at least the average wage bears close resemblance towards what ' s
going on in the market
but if i would come back to t l on the point about unemployment
throughout the ninety eighties unemployment has never been
much above uhm three percent
only in two years i think nineteen eighty two nineteen eighty five
was at top at about five percent
for hong kong for our stage of economic development
i think we can classify falling one-word at
about three percent
well uhm i think mr tam ' s point would be in a society which
does not have a lot of social security a lot of uhm public welfare to
have that kind of unemployment would not be acceptable in the longer run
you can have it for year maybe eighteen months
but to have it sustain over a period of time
uhm would would be uh politically unacceptable
i think we can uh be uh reasonably assure that if the economy
continuous to be as as as well manages it has been over the past forties
years
as there ' s no reason to believe why would for for as
long as we maintain the free market economy
then the past can speak for itself
as i said over the nineteen eighties uh unemployment has with
the exceptional one or two years not been above three percentage
 oh but do 
i i always work under the assumption that the economy is not
managed
that you actually allow people to run their own show make their
money and invest their money or take their money out of hong kong
that ' s one of the you know great strength of the hong kong
economy that it is free and open ended
now uhm however one of the problem of this kind of economy is
that when executives choose to leave multinational companies or local
companies
then you are you you are uhm in a very tight spot
last year the estimate is that fifty five thousand people left
hong kong
mainly of these maybe up to quarter are university educated
they have ten fifteen years management experience behind them
how do you propose to replace these
we think that uhm there are two ways in which i think we can
replace the loss
but let me first say that i don't expect the loss to be permanent
one
i mean don't forget that the really serious uhm that that
the outflow of of of experienced people did really start early until about
nineteen eighty eight
given about three or four years quite a few of these people
would want to would start contemplating coming back to work in hong kong
if things continue uh uh to go well because they would have
qualified for their foreign passport
they already were beginning to find more than a tackle 
coming back now 
 
 is that not one civil servant is come back though
well i mean if civil ser one civil ser if
civil servant has gone gone aboard uhm 
they they would probably be pensionless 
but that apart
there are two ways as i said early of of of replacing the loss
one is through uh doubling of our uh provision of first
year first degree places
and the other of course is a programme by which we facilitate the
return of investors of past emigrants
uh who who have prospect of coming back to to work in
hong kong
uhm in combination these two programmes would reduce our
 one-word 
but even then i even there i ' m not one-word 
 
yeung kai yin thank you very much for coming in
we will back in a moment with lee cheuk yan chief executive of
the hong kong confederation of trade union
