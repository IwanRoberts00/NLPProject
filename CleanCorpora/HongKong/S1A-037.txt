""

 uhm uhm

 was in form five     uh one of uh my english  
teacher  is very very kind to   me

and she always accept she uhm even uhm encourage me   to
 uhm read some  bo  story book and then after that write her a
write uh wrote wrote a report to her and then   she can  
gi  could she can give me some   mark  to improve my
  english

  so  i i keep on uhm  tut  keep on uhm
studying   this subject 
 
""
 uhm uh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh huh

 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 aw  
""
 uhm   uhm 
""
""
in fact uhm your situation is similar to mine
""
""
oh  unidentified s sound 
""
""
  yeah  uh but it started earlier
""
  it  ' s  in form it  ' s during uhm my primary six
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 aw   
""
""
  aw  so you  ' re   so lucky 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
yeah it uhm the teachers was very kind to   me 
and she was very   patient 
""
and since then i i even determined to be a   teacher 
to follow her example
""
    and then uh in form five there  ' s uhm there was
also a good   teacher  and and but he isn't uhm he was a little
bit uhm soft to   us 
""
he is not he was not so   harsh  but in form six 
   a an and extremely harsh   teacher taught us 
""
and she  t  told   us  to bring the oxford
dictionary   everyday     for  the english
lesson
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
 aw  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm 
""
 aw  
""
""
 aw  
""
pocket size
 
""
no no   no  
""
""
 no  
""
the thick one
""
  you think  yeah you know how   can  how
could we     walk uhm up fours uh walk up to uh the  fo
 fourth floor with a thick dictionary   everyday 
 
""
 oh uh  
""
 aw  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
yeah   uh    huh huh  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 what   is the purpose of that
""
""
for for just for the english lessons
""
""
aw
""
""
for for example uhm when we  di  uhm didn't know how to
uhm use that word or uhm wanted to check the meaning     than we
have to use it
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm may be i think that may be he want to encourage indirectly that
uh that you that uh you you should better to remember every word so that one
day you can use it you can not bring it to school
""
""
uhm yah may may be but i  ' m  af  i  ' m afraid  sh
 uhm her intention was not   so deep  as you think
""
she is she was so harsh   and   tut  and she
uhm and she was   famous  for her   harshness 
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 aw 
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
yeah   i 
""
""
 he   has the intention to abuse you
""
""
abuse that uh yes uhm  tut  she  tut  once uhm
once uhm she treated badly to a boy     who uhm wore
 unidentified speech  the boy   wore  a pair
of coloured socks   to  s  school  which is not allowed
  at that time 
""
then he  as  uhm  sh  the teacher   ask 
him to uhm uh walk around the classroom with his trousers a little bit 
 uhm   s  stick up     so that all of us can
uhm look at his colourful and beautiful socks
""
""
 aw  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 aw  
""
 there  
""
oh
""
""
i think   this 
""
""
 embarrasses him  
""
""
yah
""
i think this uhm  tut  this was not uhm what a teacher
should do
""
""
uhm   uhm 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
in fact may be she she is she is uh uhm she had a little bit
uhm mental problem
""
but but uhm i admitted that she was very good at english
""
  but  i think his mind has some problem
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
  uhm 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
yeah
""
have have you experienced such teacher
""
""
no and my teachers is very kind actually
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
so now you study comparative   english  
""
""
 yes   yes
 
""
so you are enjoying 
""
""
uh yah   because  uh it is more uh interesting
  than english 
""
 tut  english is very very  s  uhm   very
""
 
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah uh  
""
  one-word    so far 
""
""
boring
""
""
yah boring
""
  i  ' m 
 
""
 it  ' s   not 
""
""
uh huh it  ' s   always  said uh say something
about the grammar the  sy  syntax   the   
phonetics 
""
it is too boring i   think 
""
but comparative literature is uhm more about the uhm some issues
in   the   so  some social issues may be uh for example
  gender  uh the uhm the race or such as   uh such as
 yah it  ' s more interesting
""
and then uh help us to uhm  cri  think critically
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
 yeah  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh huh uh  
""
uhm uhm so you need to read many uh english novel and poem 
  is it  
""
""
 yah   yes but uhm but i find that after uh three
years in   this  field as i find that i  ' m i  ' m not very uhm
smart in uh reading some   book  reading the   book
 because my reading speed extremely  ex  uh very very slow
""
so uhm so this  ye  this year   i  take a a
film culture
""
the course call film culture
""
it  ' s uh mainly uh require us to watch movie
""
   it  ' s  more  e  it  ' s easier
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm i see 
""
""
but in fact english can be very interesting
""
""
oh
""
""
yeah
""
yup  e  even though i  ' m not interested in uhm studying
english literature     i think uhm english grammar  
  is of extreme uh extreme uhm extreme how to say that extreme uhm
curiosity     pe     perhaps 
""
i think i think uhm just with a simple sentence uh we can uh
divide divides a lot of theories and a lot of   interpretations 
""
and i think it  ' s better than comparative literature
""
yeah in in fact uhm it  ' s very difficult is it to uhm compare 
 the literature  of two different places or even more  dif 
uhm more places    
""
and i think it  ' s uhm difficult in the sense that uhm you have to
look at the culture   or </[5 uh the other   s  uhm social
environment   of that   pla  uh of those   places
""
""
but  eng  but for english grammar and you have uh you can
just look at the sentence   or  you can you can just look at the
word   then  you can make a lot of   analysis 
""
yeah it  ' s much simpler
""
and and after your analysis i think  tut  uhm i can get
much satisfaction from it
""
  yeah  don't you agree
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 oh ho  
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm aw  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
no it  ' s strongly disagree
""
what do you think about it
 
""
  uhm  
""
""
 do   you think english is uh you know uh you 
 you mention this 
""
  yah 
""
do you do you   like english 
 
""
 i i understand  
""
 i understand you  
""
 uhm  
""
i like english literature 
""
""
you like    
 
""
 yah   because uh i like uh i like the thinking
  uh  a-few-words   reading english  
literature  i can think of of what about     so when i
study i read english book   uh  i can think more   think
about    their source  
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes uhm and i think that uhm to do some to do just uh focus
the work on the uh the grammar the the sentence is very boring
""
just look at the sentence and i  tut  think about it 
 oh  such a boring thing that you can do
 
""
 but i know    unidentified-sound 
""
everybody  ' s character is different
""
so we cannot 
""
""
yeah may be miss  one-word  is a little
considerate
""
""
yah
""
""
yeah
""
but uh may be may be i i in fact i like reading books  
about  reading english literature
""
but i don't like to read it for   examination 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm   yah
""
i agree that
 
""
  yeah i  
""
""
 yup   uh i prefer reading it and after that uhm i
can think whatever way i like instead of thinking of how to answer the 
examin   unidentified sound overlaps  examination  
questions 
""
that i think it it will uhm discourage me   or  uhm
give me a burden   on  reading the book    then 
i therefore i prefer  st  uhm studying   sentences 
""
  sentences  or words i think is it is because i
think uhm why i uhm i  ' m studying the  so  the sounds or the words or
  sentences 
""
i  ' m doing it uhm not only for my interest and also for my
examination and there  ' s a direct relationships   between  what
i  ' ve done in the course and or and in the examination    
""
then  tut  i think uhm it  ' s much simpler   
""
""
yah for literature it  ' s too difficult for me
""
huh therefore i only uhm i have only chosen uhm two three yah
three courses     on english literature and the  othe 
and the rest are uhm on english grammar
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
  uh 
""
aw 
""
""
yah
 
""
i see 
""
""
it may be   it  it seems that it  ' s easier for
me
""
  and  i can survive longer
 
""
 it  ' s so  
""
  one-word   
""
uh how about uh after graduation what you will do
""
  continue  study
""
continue studying english grammar 
""
""
 uhm  
""
yah if if uhm if i can get the second a of course i want to study
uhm further uh to further my studies
 
""
uhm 
""
""
but uhm in fact i am now thinking of the plans and the the
topics that i would do for my  post  post graduate studies
""
and of course one of the areas is uhm english grammar  
especially  about  s  english   syntax 
""
and another area is uhm about hong kong english    but
 uh but i think it  ' s very difficult for me to to uhm    tut
    to  do researches on the latter field on hong kong
english
""
first of all uhm there have already been a lot of uhm works done
by the linguists on this area and and this put a put great pressure on me
""
yeah
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
oh what is your hong kong english is
""
so you uh i know because uh uh many korean they   cannot
 understand the hong kong english because that  ' s why uh our korean we
don't have much opportunity to uh practice english
""
we just uh high school we just uh study   grammar 
""
we don't have much uh opportunity to to meet a foreigner
""
so uh actually they can their listen uh our listening and
speaking is not so good
""
so many times they said to me our hong kong english is very uh
difficult to hear difficult to understand
""
  i think  you have uh uhm many uh accent
""
cantonese you have seven   nine 
""
yes   so  i think uh many english is influenced by a
  cantonese  tones   so  hong kong english means uh
   one-word   
""
  uhm  
""
  uhm  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 nine accents 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
""
 aw  
""
""
 yeah   uh in for me hong kong english means
uhm english used in hong kong   by  hong kong   people
""
""
yah and in fact this issue uhm this issue is very controversial
   
""
in a sense that many many people in hong   kong 
speak bad english.
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uh huh huh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
no no no no     better than   korean
 
""
""
 yah  
""
 it  ' s what  
""
no in in in fact it is uhm     it is discussed and
even accepted by many linguists
""
linguists that uhm many people speak poor english uhm and there
""
""
  com   
 
""
no no 
""
""
yeah
 
""
no no no
""
better than korean 
""
""
well i think that i think  s  the problem is similar
""
yah uhm i mean the situation in korea   is  similar
to that uh in hong kong in the sense that we don't have much   chance
 uhm to meet a foreigner and to speak or even even we can meet uhm a
  foreigner  uhm we  d  do not have the   courage
 to do so to just to walk towards him and to talk with him
""
i think the confidence is uhm is what uh being absent in hong kong
   
""
yeah
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
i think that you have more opportunity
""
you have english school more than our korean 
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
 
""
how about you 
""
""
uhm
 
""
how about you 
""
""
you mean
 
""
uh hong kong english
""
what do you feel 
""
""
yah   i  ' m the same  same as  sh  his uhm
 opin  uh her opinions
""
uhm yah because we the little opportunity to meet a foreigner
""
  and  even yah if we did as she as she said even we
have uhm we encounter a foreigner     uh we have not the
confident to speak to him or her
""
and i think that english uh any   language  you have
to uh you should  h  if you want to learn uhm uhm you  ' ve if you want
to have a good uh proficiency in a  lan  in any   language
 you have uh to have a  tut  good environment   to to
 keep a bit by bit to improve   it 
""
just for example if if you just uh meet a foreigner and  
then talk to him in few sentences  it do not  ca  uh can give you
any improvement because   just  a few   sentences
""
""
if you but if you uhm can live in a foreign   places
 foreign place   and then  everybody around you 
 is a  foreigner   then  you have to keep on 
te  talking english   with them  then you can improve it
 
""
 hong kong english  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm i see  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm i see  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
yah  a-few-words   a overlaps with z  ' s
unclear speech  
""
""
uh yah for example    la  uhm  in
learning the uh mandarin   putonghua  yah one of my teacher 
 said tell  me that uh he doesn't know he didn't uh he didn't know
uh anything about this   language 
""
but once he uhm he uhm when he one in a time he uh went to 
 taiwan for  a tourist   tour  tourism
""
and for three two or three months   and  than oh she
uh he his  pu  his mandarin is very   good  after he back
to hong kong
""
  yah 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  putong   
""
 uhm  
""
 uh huh huh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh huh  
""
 uh  
""
 oh really  
""
 yah   of course
""
so learning mandarin 
""
""
oh no
""
yah even for  s  but if you for uh for some people in 
 hong  kong uh learning  pu  mandarin uhm for example you
just uhm the take   lesson take the uh courses 
""
for for example for a long   year uh through a year 
he may not uh  s  can speak as well as the   my teacher
because  the environment is very important
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm you have many englishes school uh english primary school 
 english  uh middle school is it 
""
""
  yah  
""
yes     but i think that uhm that uhm my teacher
  is  is speaking in english so our uhm our uhm uhm mastering in
   eng   in uh  s  listening is better  
but  because we dare not to speak to uh   to talk to her or him
 so that our mastering in  sp  uh speaking not so good
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uh  
""
oh i see 
""
""
yah
""
""
i think uhm i think the expose to english for uhm only  s
 in english   lessons 
""
and we seldom switch to an english channel and to uh watch the
  news or to  watch a film except uh for example uhm uh some
specials something special on on   tv 
""
but uhm i think uhm we seldom use english in our   daily
 life
""
we seldom  t  talk in   english  it  ' s it  ' s
rather   odd  to speak in english uhm during our  day 
daily life
""
i think uh may be uhm for example if two of us speak in  eng
 uh speak in english uhm on our way to  s  school or uh on our on
our way to uhm   home  we may we may be treated as strangers or
aliens
""
aliens in the society
""
how come how come you two foolish   guy uhm  speak in
english
""
uh you are you are the chinese you are hong   kongese
 how come you speak in   english

it  ' s odd

 uhm uhm

 uhm

 uhm

korean school uh high school are   all  teachers are
all korean    but  university and colleges are different

  foreigner  but not so much chance

so we  one-word  don't have   much
 many opportunity    of  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 aw  
""
 aw  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm   but english   is it 
important in korea as as it in as important as in hong kong
 
""
 uhm  
""
english very   important  but uh but i think uh hong
kong uh you have a extra-need got   after  graduation if you go
to a foreigner   company   two-words  korean
not so   much 
""
but uh many student from middle school uh only learn english 
 but  actually they cannot speak english 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm 
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm uhm uhm
 
""
they cannot speak english 
""

uhm but  eng  english is a fact of life   
 is it

  yah  for survival

otherwise uhm otherwise if if we don't know any english words than
huh uh it it uhm we may lead a difficult life     isn't

 yah  
""
 uhm

like in   hong kong is different  
""
""
 yah  
""
""
 do you do you   do you find difficulties uh
when you come to hong kong to use english to communicate communicate with
other
 
""
ah yes some difficult because you have a tone you have a 
 cantonese accent

some uh camp name of   camp  ati     i just say
ati but you uh hong kong uh students say ati

i think you you learn uh your uhm it took i think cantonese is a
very difficult to learn   for a foreigner

 yeah too   difficult
""
  yes  
""
""
 yeah   but you can can can talk it

because i live in hong kong

yeah but even some of my foreigner   friend  uh
she he he or she   doesn't  can talk  ve  very  
well  can   cannot talk very well   in cantonese 
because   they  they cannot because they said that cantonese is
very is uh how to say rhythm is it rhythm

rhythm   yes 
""

 yah  
""
the   rhythm 
""
""
 or   intonation
""
""
yah the   intonation  is very difficult to 
  re  to imitate 
 
""
 uh huh  
""
 yes  
""
  yes  
""

 yah   yah i think intonation and accent uh uhm
are two areas that uh   foreigners  find it difficult in
