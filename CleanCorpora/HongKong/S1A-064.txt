<I>
 
i i i would i would agree to this
but uhm uhm i make no further comment 
 and
 laugh 
you can uh ask me anything you like 
oh would you mind me call you steve in the conversation
it ' s more convenience
 or you 
or you want me dis 
 and
 laugh 
 
 no 
 my lord 
you call me my lord 
come on 
 laughs 
 
okay i ' m just joking
you can call me steve
okay okay 
yeah the tape stops for two seconds 
what are you going to tell us
anything you like 
 give a lecture 
 laughs 
yeah it ' s begin
it ' s start
perhaps uh you can tell me something about yours
because i don't know who are you and
when did you come to hong kong
or why would you uh like to stay in hong kong
something like that
do you have a chinese wife or 
 laughs or something like that
 
came
i came to hong kong in nineteen eighty-six 
and uh i arrive here actually on august the eleven 
 laughs nineteen eighty-six which was one day
before my birthday 
 quite detail 
oh
why would you choose hong kong and not other place
 
the reason i chose to come to hong kong in nineteen eighty-six was
because
i had come here a a year or two earlier than that 
i really like hong kong
so i apply for a job in university
and uh i was accepted
uhm in those days they were accepting everybody 
 and
 laugh 
what do you think in these days
if the same thing happen
uhm this early year
would they accept you
 
i don't think so
actually i don't know
but uh certainly i believe that it ' s true that
in those days i think they have fewer applications for jobs
than they have now 
i think there ' re a lot more applications 
to work in the university of hong kong now than there were 
nearly ten years ago 
uhm
oh just different from accepting students you know 
 
in past years they do not accept everybody as their students
but nowadays everybody can be a hong kong u student 
 laughs 
 uhm 
 
oh i see i see
so the opposite is true for the students 
so for students it ' s easier to get in
but for teachers is harder to get in
is that it
uhm
now in your research
is is that
are you just interested in in the person ' s accent
in the way they uh uh what i
are are you interested in 
 yeah 
yeah uh we ' re just try to find out uhm
how a non-native speaker react to a native speaker
we our focus point is the hong kong english
because we uh sometimes people say that
we are speaking the hong kong english
but not the non-standard english
 but some argue that it is only the incorrect
english
 so we tries to find out the difference
between
uh so we have to a a native speaker to encourage the non-native
speaker to speak
and to uhm has a comparison
act as a comparison 
 
 oh i see 
 i see 
 i see 
what you want me to say thing is that may confuse you
no 
no
 
no
okay 
yeah
 
okay 
so you you you want me to just carry on a normal 
conversation 
okay 
 yeah yeah 
as casual as possible
 
okay 
yeah
 
uhm
you ' re asking me my about my my reason for coming to hong 
 kong 
okay 
 yeah 
yes uh
do you enjoy living and working here
 do you think hong kong is a a suitable place
suitable place for you to live and to work
 
 yes i do 
yes i do
i like it here 
really
 
yes 
why
 
well because uhm 
it ' s very crowded but it ' s very lively
and of course we lectures
uh do have a a very good living environment 
 hong kong is so crowded 
because you are wealthy 
 laughs 
 
why
be because we are wealthy
 yeah i i i think compare to most hong kong people
we are wealthy and we live well
that ' s true
 we have a lot of privileges
and we are very lucky to have those 
 and
 laugh 
it ' s true 
 yeah 
 so uh 
 long holiday 
lot of holidays uhm easy job
wealthy
good students 
 laughs 
really
do you think your students are good or are easy
to teach
 
 i 
i think they ' re easy to teach yes
i think there
for the most part quite good 
yes 
really oh
 
it ' s certainly our pcll students are are are good
the only exception i ever encounter is a person name uh tut
 grace 
 and
 laugh 
uh but uh i didn't heard
no they ' ve been all very good 
 yeah 
 
 yeah 
our students are good
and uh what else
uhm they work hard 
and uhm 
except grace
 
and they what 
except grace 
 
 except grace
no no no
they all work hard
i was only joking about grace
uh what else can i tell you about 
 then 
what what would you usually do during your leisure time
if you think that you enjoy living in hong kong
 
oh uhm
during my leisure time lately
i have been uhm just sleeping
i ' ve been very tired lately actually
because i ' ve been been working very very hard
but other than sleeping and eating
i play tennis i go swimming
and uhm sometimes i play squash
and uhm i play with my daughter 
go out to eat a lot 
always have a family day
 
family day
family everyday is family day 
uhm
so so wonderful
yeah 
 laughs 
so warm
yeah
this what i ' m looking for a warm family
yeah
 
okay 
then do you know that uhm tut 
many chinese or many people in hong kong are living in a very
poor environment or their family are 
what what what should i say
uhm in a uhm 
i want to say that many children in hong kong are looking for a
family like your yours 
but they can't
do you know that 
you since you you are
i think that you are in a higher level in hong kong
or uhm i don't know whether you know the uh
situation of them
or something like that
 
 yes 
 uhm uhm 
so which you ' re saying is that
because i i live a privilege life 
i don't really know how
how the poor in hong kong live 
 yeah 
i don't know whether you know or not
 i just ask yeah 
 
 oh you ' re asking me 
do i know how they live
uhm well i i ' ve been inside public flats
so i know what that that looks like 
you know public housing uh uh flats
and uhm tut i i uhm 
do i really know how they live
no i don't
because i haven't live the way they have live 
right no i don't know
but i know that a lot of people in hong kong really struggle
very hard 
 yes 
 uhm uhm 
then do you think that you are are 
how to say
you are lucky
yeah
 
do i think that i am lucky
absolutely i think i ' m 
 you understand me all speakers laugh 
 
 yes 
 of course we ' re speaking the same language
 
am i am i lucky
yeah i ' m lucky 
 yeah 
but the
do you think uh your lucky is uhm
because of your hard working or just you are born as a lucky
person 
 and
 laugh 
 
do i think that my my luck comes from hard work or just 
fate 
yeah
 
i think uh it ' s a combination of both 
interestingly though i think 
many hong kong people especially young people believe that 
luck 
actually uh uh no not luck
but success originate from hard work 
do you believe that 
 uhm 
no
 
no 
 and
 laugh 
 i would say
i would say that there would be a combination
 
 no 
it ' s a combination
yeah
but i i ' m i think i ' m lucky
yeah
sure 
but i still think that fate is more important than hard
working 
 laughs 
yeah
 
you think so 
yeah
someone can spend all his time on working
just like a cow
but he can't get anything
but someone can
if he if his fate is good then even he ' s lazy
he can have a life
or just uh a average life
yeah i think fate is more important
 
it depend on the person
it depend on the environment 
because the thing in hong kong 
if you work hard
i think you have more opportunity than elsewhere to achieve
basically you born in hong kong
you are lucky 
 laughs 
 
yeah i mean 
 yes 
just part of fate if you want to say
 yeah 
 
 that ' s true
so certainly compare to other places 
probably hard work place a larger part of a person ' s success in
hong kong than say in uhm 
i know one-word for example
or in canada where i ' m from 
because you can work very hard in in uh canada
and and not uh achieve as much as in hong kong 
 si simply because it ' s at the moment right now
there are more opportunities in hong kong 
it it 
 would you consider leaving hong kong
 
 have i consider 
oh oh uh
have i consider leaving hong kong after nineteen ninety-seven
yes i have 
 after nineteen ninety seven 
when ninety six or 
 laughs 
 i would 
yeah
 
 you you mean 
you mean when i ' ll leave 
i really don't know
what do you think
could you think i should leave 
uhm
actually i ' ve confidence in hong kong
 ninety seven were 
especially you know the legal profession 
okay you are very good 
 laughs legal profession
so why should you leave
 
 you have confidence 
 uhm uhm 
uh ha
oh don't you think the uh chinese government want want a
lot of westerners working in the university 
i don't think they would expel these people
because they need these people here in hong kong 
 
 you think so 
yeah
 
you think they need me 
yeah 
 and
 laugh 
they need the support of foreigners as china 
 
 uh ha 
but i would like to stay in hong kong
but i like everybody else
we like a lot of people
i have my concern telephone rings 
yeah so 
what about you
are you are you leaving hong kong
or planning to leave hong kong 
no 
i have no chance to leave
also i i ' ve confidence in hong kong
because uhm anyway i ' m a chinese 
i think hong kong should be uhm under the
under the control of chinese
but i don't think that uhm britain is a good uhm 
government for us
 yeah 
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
do you like have a a chinese government in hong kong 
 or you want a hong kong government
 
or do you want a hong kong government in hong kong 
 of course
then if i can choose
i would like to have a hong kong government
but i think it is quite impossible 
yeah i i think that
 
 yeah 
it ' s it ' s not likely 
yeah
it ' s inevitable for prc government to come in
involve in the ruling of over hong kong people
 
they already are involved 
uhm
they will actually rule us after nineteen ninety seven
uhm uhm
but but two-words the point is rather
they would
uhm continue our system our present system of our community 
economic uh political and legal system in hong kong with
that
would they continue or would they just try to replace
with a completely new idea of system
 
well i don't think they ' ll try to replace it
because they don't have anything to replace it with 
well they just can just create anything
 
 yeah 
well i certainly hope that does not happen
because hong kong has been a hundred and fifty years
involving slowing
and and it would be uh certainly unfortunate
if they were to uh change what what works so well
cause a lot of things do work well
except i i think except for the colonial aspects so in uh
hong kong
it works very well 
 right 
actually the prc government need uhm hong kong
as uhm international finance centre
 
uhm uhm 
and i don't think you just to
i don't think the government would collapse our system
 
well that ' s hope not 
it ' s beautiful looking outside all-laugh 
oh i ' m sorry
i forget to tell you one thing one important thing 
 laughs 
 
okay 
yeah 
 and
 laugh 
 
you forgot to tell me important
i hope you not playing that
no no you going to uhm 
to have the information about the speakers
just basic informations 
 
 oh information about the speaker
 you mean me 
so you want me to say my name and 
 laughs 
 yeah 
 yeah because 
 yeah 
 oh okay something like that 
 
 okay my name 
alright
do you want me to say that on tape
how about how about i do that on tape 
 several words 
 no no no
 
you mean i have to write it all down 
yeah
 
do i get any remuneration for this 
 laughs 
since it is the research project
 
alright 
you have to write this down
it ' s a charity
 
uh ha 
i ' m sorry that
i forget to 
 laughs mention this important thing
 
 so i ' ll i ' ll 
i ' ll i ' ll complete this after we speak
or you want me to do it now 
okay
as you like
 
because if i do it now
i don't think the tape would be able to hear it 
 and
 laughs 
right 
yeah
 
okay
so you can ask me anything else 
how old are you 
 laughs 
 
why i ' m i ' m 
i ' m older than you
i ' m older than you
 i ' m old enough to be your father 
 we ' re just looking at the form 
 i ' ve got
that ' s that ' s certain 
 and
 laugh 
how old are your daughter
 
my daughter is uh five 
oh only five
 
yeah 
it ' s lucky to be your daughter
 yeah 
 
 you think so 
why do you ask her 
 yes 
 laughs 
okay some other days 
 laughs maybe
would you mind your daughter to date with a chinese 
to have a dating with or to fall in love with a chinese
 
uhm i don't think i would mind
no 
 and
 laugh 
i don't think i would mind
no 
uhm
 
uhm 
have you ever tries to fall in love with a
chinese yourself 
 laughs 
oh yeah
then do do you thought
do you think it is interesting or uh 
 laughs 
you have
are you find uh difficulties in the communicate communication
 interesting
you describe as interesting 
 
i
no i don't have any difficulties in speaking to chinese
people
i don't think 
but uhm
 
yes i speak chinese 
yeah apart from 
 laughs the language
 uh you two have many difficult uh difference
 
 yeah 
yes
because there ' re a lot of cultural differences 
yeah
so how do you two compromise
or just conflict 
 laughs 
 
but uh there there is an easy way to to uh one-word
 solution of conflict between chinese culture and western
culture
and that is to follow the chinese culture 
but we are in hong kong
we ' re having all kind of cultures
and we can stay alive 
 laughs 
 
 yes 
yes 
no difficulty 
 actually since uhm we are chinese we
we still have some tradition i think
 it it is different from the uh foreigner foreigners
 you can follow your tradition 
 
 yes 
 you have the you have the
you have the choice
what kind of tradition you want to follow
and what do you don't
you can make your own decision
no one trying to stop you 
but do you want it
some examples of of the differences in culture 
okay 
 yeah yeah 
i think it ' s interesting
 
okay if you invite 
if you invite chinese people for a dinner
for six o'clock 
 and
 laugh 
they would arrive at six o'clock
and shortly after dinner they would go home
all at the same time 
but if you inv but if if you invite western people for
dinner
they would arrive
they would expect to be uhm tut uh
they would ex expect to have a drinks
usually alcohol in you ' re sitting around your drinking
you talk for hours
and then finally when everybody is one-word 
hungry
you ' ll all eat tut and uh during the dinner you ' ll
 talk about a number of things
and then finally at about midnight they ' ll go home 
 laughs 
that ' s one difference 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm
 
the other thing is if you go into a a chinese home
and the uh television set is on 
uhm nobody mind
everybody just let the tv go on
but if you go to a western home
they usually turn off the television set
actually if you go into a chinese home
they will turn on the television set 
 laughs 
if you go into a western home now 
turn off the television set 
uhm
 
those are just two very minor difference
the other th thing is if
if uh if you ' re eating
and a chinese person offer you more food
and you say no no no thank you
he thinks you mean you want more food 
 laughs 
 si so you eat more and more and more 
 laughs 
but but in in in western society
if you say no no no more
it means no more 
those are two differences 
maybe we are staying in this kind situation for too long that
well we ' re not appreciate this differences
we can't we we just not notice this in our daily life
 but maybe you come from completely western world
and then you come to hong kong the chinese society
you can see the difference
 just ignore them
 
 yes 
 yes 
there are lot of differences
and they ' re very amusing 
uh
 amusing 
 but do you know how to play mahjong
if you know then
i i don't think that the chinese uh will uh
will come to your home and then just have
uh just have the dinner and then go
 
no no
but if if uhm
if i play mahjong and set up the mahjong table
we have to invite them for four o'clock in the afternoon 
 and
 laugh 
and then they they ' ll be all afternoon
and then they eat dinner right 
so uhm
yeah i mean ord ordinary if if uh people have dinner
they will start playing mahjong early in the afternoon
and then play and play and play and finally they ' ll have dinner
so it ' s the opposite actually
it ' s the opposite of western ' s society
there ' s lot of uh play and talk before dinner
but then in in in in
in western society there ' s play and
play and talk mainly after dinner
 sort of
 one-word some some differences
western people do not play mahjong 
 laughs 
why do chinese people play mahjong 
 oh yeah 
 uhm 
why do people not gambling 
 and
 laugh 
it is just a one kind of gambling
 people several words 
 
 yes 
but it ' s a way for for people to 
exciting
 
yes
it was it ' s a way for people to interact 
it ' s a way for people to have social relations is to
play mahjong 
really
it ' s just talking exchanging their mind as during the
game
 
that ' s right
i mean if you just sit down with that chinese person
and want to have a conversation without doing something else
at the same time
sometime they get a bit nervous 
because it ' s very uncomfortable
not always
but if if if you meet a person for the first time
often
so they would prefer to have a structure like mahjong or
you know other things 
 uhm 
then do you know how to play
 
mahjong 
 yeah 
 
 yes 
do you do enjoy it
 
no 
oh
 you enjoy 
 
 no 
yeah sometime sometimes 
 i don't know how to play it 
 
 it ' s a bit 
uh i i used to play many years ago
but i i don't find that it ' s interesting
but a lot of people do
you obvious young to enjoy mahjong 
 and
 laugh 
but it but it is exciting 
 laughs i think yeah 
 
 uh ha 
how often do you play 
oh not so la 
 just a 
 
 once a month 
no
just a few times a a year
 
yeah 
only on special occasion
especially in lunar new year
 
yeah chinese new year 
 yeah 
because at that time i have money to all speakers laugh 
lose 
 laughs 
yeah
 
yes
so uh let me think
are there any differences
other differences between the cultures 
do you have uh some uhm problems or the uhm 
i i i want to know that uhm
what do have already mention is only uhm tut little
uh
is only little difference or doesn't matter anyway
 
uhm uhm a long pause and the door closes 
uhm uhm 
yeah i think
uhm it ' s it is easy to handle
but do do you have some problems that uhm
it is difficult for you two to compromise 
since you are uhm 
you two are come from different background
 
uhm you mean other other certain things in her culture
 
that i find very difficult 
 yeah 
yeah
 
no 
no
 
no nothing
but i can think of that 
and no nothing 
oh so
 
no i can't
i ' m sorry i can't think of anything 
is it because your wife is uhm is a very open minded
or is not a traditional chinese
 
no she she ' s uh quite traditional in some ways 
but uhm i think the most difficult thing is to learn the
correct way of behaving
 becau because if you don't behave probably it ' s
you know it ' s very embarrassing 
there ' re many examples
especially during eating 
if you do the wrong thing at the table
it you know it ' s very it ' s very uhm embarrassing for other
other people 
would you find some kind of pressure
when you ' re eating with these chinese people
 
pressure 
pressure
 
yeah
it ' s pressurable
but uhm uhm 
you know it ' s it ' s not it ' s not the same as eating eating at a
western table
manner is different
the table manner is different 
so it ' s important to be able to do the right thing 
right 
an example is uh i i mean is is to uhm uhm 
eat more rice and less sung cantonese
word for food right
 si sometime if you are very hungry
you just eat all the sung cantonese word for
food and you don't eat your rice
so that ' s uh very uhm very embarrassing if
if if you do the wrong thing like that 
do you have any other questions 
i think you should ask some
ask me some questions
i ' ll i should be involve in your project
yeah
yeah look at this one
then what do you want to tell 
 laughs 
what you want to know about me
 what you don't know about me
 uh 
we have been friends so long
 
how long have you been friends 
two years 
 laughs 
nearly three year
 
what did your mean 
well i mean
well in the one-word tut short times
about two or three years
we one-word tut getting along so
well
and we keep so close
 
uhm uhm
where did you meet
at the university 
yeah
 
yeah 
yes
 
how did 
oh we both play drama
we join the drama society in university
 we meet each other
 
 oh 
 oh 
oh i see
then what did you act in 
we were we work in the back stage
 
uh ha 
different kind of post
uhm i ' ve been working in the costume department
the sound department the light department
and acting as an asm or sm stage manager
 
 yeah 
 uhm 
i see that ' s interesting 
yes
we met each other
 
are you still doing that 
no retired
we too old for that 
 laughs 
old you only 
 laughs 
i ' m still young
we have the year one or year two students doing this
 
oh i see
so you didn't uh continue in in in the drama society 
 laughs 
you know the work load in the pcll course
 
uh i see 
and just final year student
you ' ll just cannot spare time out 
 ors 
 
 i see 
 i see 
so what are you going to do after your degree 
i don't know
uhm 
personally i want to work in the mass media 
but it is very very in uh difficult i think
especially i ' m not doing the communication course 
but only uhm english uh and chinese 
so i don't 
 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 you mean it ' s hard to get a job
or it ' s hard to work there 
difficult to get a work side b 
 
how many minutes is that
a half an hour so far 
uhm we 
 haven't 
yeah
 
 okay 
 already have it
already half an hour 
 
 already half an hour
so we we still have uh fifteen minutes 
okay so you ' re saying that it ' s hard hard to get a job 
 yeah 
yeah
because uhm
usually uhm it is it is not uhm 
the mass media would not uh recruit uh the their 
oh i forget everything
 
the mass media would not recruit what 
recruit people are on from advertisement
usually they introduce one by one
so if i don't know anyone in the mass media i
it is difficult for me to join the industry i
think
 
 i see 
so you have to have a connections 
yeah
it is not uhm as easy as for
for example the law
you can apply through any firm that you like it
but for mass media it is not as that
uhm uhm
 
yeah well
maybe you can find a job in another field 
 perhaps 
 what ' s your second best choice
 
yeah
what ' s your that ' s a good good question
what ' s your second best choice 
 laughs 
i don't know
apart from mass media 
 laughs 
i don't know
you don't have any other interest
except joining the mass media
yeah
 but 
 then you have to find some 
 laughs 
perhaps
but do you really like studying law
or do you do you
would you enjoy doing in this field after four years 
of study
 of course 
of course
beginning i was just
uhm i don't know
i don't mind what i ' m going to learn
i don't mind what i ' m going to do
but uh during the three years the three years undergraduate
course
i found that it ' s interesting and it ' s challenging
and then and i start finding what is the most interesting part
 in the course
and i would say litigation
i ' ll be interested in litigation in the future
of course uhm some tut senior uh colleagues told me
it ' s hard for young lady to work in the litigation field
especially civil litigation
because there are too many paper works
and you have to stay very late at the in the office
if you ' re go to to do litigation
but i reply by saying that
i ' m young i ' ve the energy 
 laughs 
what can i lose
just try uhm
and i i can anticipate those uhm difficulties and hardship
that
i think i ' m willing to try that
but uhm tut 
it ' s not my choice actually because
if i join in a firm
uh it is up to the partners to tell you what i ' m going to do
and not i and not me to tell them what i want to do
you know the difference
you know i just i just can't make the decision
uhm you may say how the fate 
 laughs 
how the fate is going to allocate me
 
well uhm 
so what field you ' re going to 
if you don't if you unable to go into mass media 
i don't know but uhm
i only sure that i ' m not
i won't be a teacher
i won't join the education field
 
oh i see 
 yeah 
 
 so that ' s the one thing you determine not to be is
a teacher
why is that 
 yeah
but 
 unchallenging you know
 
is it because it seem very boring 
not really
but i think uhm i ' m not qualify to teach others 
 
yeah i don't want to uh 
 laughs 
how to say ngh yahn ji daih 
cantonese word for chinese idiom in chinese 
 
 oh 
 you don't want to mislead 
you don't want to mislead
 yeah 
 
 you don't want to be what 
you don't want to mislead any children
 
oh i see 
 and
 laugh 
she always uh
she always told me that
she will be a very bad example for the
children 
he ' s not going to mislead them
 
 oh i see 
 yeah
