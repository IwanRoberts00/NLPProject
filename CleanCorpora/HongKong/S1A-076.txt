""
""
uh holly   uh  ha
""
you have you will applied for the russia uh trip
""
""
 yeah  
""
i will
""
""
yeah uh uh   right 
""
""
 but   i  ' m not sure whether i uh i was disadvantage
""
""
what is the requirement for this  uh enrolment
""
""
actually  uhm
""
""
yeah
""
""
the  inte  you have strong interest in russia language
and culture  is a must
""
  but   but since  they just select the
successful applicant from a draw
""
  and they  don't really care about you application
forms
""
""
 yes  
""
 yeah uh uh  
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
  yes 
""
uhm
""
""
 yes   
$a-and-$b-laugh 
 
""
what do you wanna want the cultural elements important
""
why is that interesting important
""
they get a narrow it down the people who actually culturally
interested or  before the end of draw 
""
""
no   unfortunately 
 
""
 so   in fact it  ' s not a must 
""
""
actually uhm in their application form
""
they ask you to write something about uhm why you join this program
""
and what you  one-word  expect to gain from this
program
""
  but they  won't read it
""
they are   just 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 won't   read it
""
""
won't 
$b-laughs 
""
  so actually just   they just use  uhm that to
have a record
""
yeah   they  don't really care about what you written
down there
""
""
  three words   
""
 uh  
""
so you may have a lot to  to to pray for every night to get 
 the  
$a-laughs 
""
""
 i   guess so because
""
yeah at first that i  i thought they would have an interview or
something
""
so i well i  ' m listening to the talk
""
i just thinking about what i should write in application form
""
  and   but  but then after she told me  that
will only have a lucky draw or something
""
and i decided ok i  ' ll just write a few lines full stop
""
""
 and  
""
  yes 
""
cos it  ' s just a random draw
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
yes
""
and it  ' s a waste of time for me to think of thousand of reasons
""
yeah they don't read it after all
""
""
so that uh you have told me that uh besides this tour
""
you want to apply for the aiesec some   were 
one-word 
""
yeah 
""
""
 x world
""
yeah  
""
x world
""
uh i  ' ve applied for the  uhm   for the 
 
""
 what  ' s the   x world 
""
""
x world is the name   of the  program 
""
""
 yeah the the name of this campaign   yeah
 
""
uh   ha  
""
""
 yeah 
""
""
 of   this campaign
""
yes and  i  ' ve applied for that program to italy  sardinia
 and in early  august
""
but i still didn't get any call or email from the organizing
committee
""
  uhm  to inform me what  the date of the  mee
 interview
""
and besides i  ' m not very sure whether i can
""
uhm i  ' m selected or not because i  ' ve got to pass the screening
""
and i would and i know that there  ' s keen competition   
but 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 so you   prefer a  a draw for that 
""
""
to prefer the  draw rather than the interview
""
""
no   no i  would i would still prefer interview
""
""
 uh yes  
 
""
uh ha 
""
""
yeah because  at least
""
well i think i  i can  uh i just think i would have a better
chance for interview
""
at least i can show them how sincere i am 
$a-laughs 
""
""
yes and tell them what the reason why you want to  go to
russia
""
""
   several words  
 
""
  several words   
""
we  ' re talking italy now 
""
""
  yeah yeah 
""
for both actually i would say
""
yeah i  ' d want an interview for the trip to russia and for the trip
to italy
""
yeah then i i  ' m sure that 
""
well at least i know  whe  whether  i whether i  will
be selected after the interview
""
i would have some idea
""
  yeah  because   tut 
""
""
 sorry italy  
""
 yeah  
 
""
i don't understand uh  now the summer trip isn't it 
""
""
yeah it  ' s summer like   study  tour
 
""
 okay   okay
""
and uh i  ' m supposed it  ' s limited seats available any books i can
seat
""
and then uhm   one-word   disgroup 
the people and you got uh so
""
uhm they have to reach we uh something yeah 
""
""
uh   let 
 
""
 i  ' m   just try to work out why if you are pay for it
""
  it  ' s such  a deal for you to be selected 
""
""
 uhm  
""
actually i don't really  know if i understand question
""
  but 
 
""
 yeah  
""
uhm  hold on
""
it  ' s a trip to italy right 
""
""

""
""

""
and it  ' s  uh seven days in   italy  
""
""
 yeah     only a week 
""
""
 yeah   only   a week 
 
""
 and and   how much you pay for that 
""
""
at least one uh ten thousand i would say
 
""
ten thousand 
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
yeah because we got to pay for the someone like uhm uh
deposit
""
and for some would like a damage fee
""
i don't know what   is that 
""
and we have to pay delegation fee     yeah
""
and it  ' s still including an uhm    air ticket 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 you  ' ve just   better do that
""
you can just to be better do that
""
go italy and back from here and stay a week
""
i mean if you were   flugo 
""
i understand that to have two thousand oh ten thousand hong kong
dollars 
""
""
you mean i don't    need to stand 
 
""
 italy italy   italy i say 
""
""
yeah but actually i  ' ve joined aiesec before
""
and i like the seminars and   i like 
 
""
 uh ha   
""
""
yeah
""
""
the people
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
  yeah  and
""
i like the parties yeah
""
""
 yeah  
""
 two-words  the parties
""
""
   two-words 
""
and  you can
""
i i don't know if you just go to italy by all by yourself
""
i  ' m   not sure  whether you can make  any  fri
 new friends
""
you can't just pick up any strangers from the street
""
but if you   join this 
 
""
 uh  one-word   
""
  two-words   
""
 but you could   it but 
""
""
no   i  won't do that

courses

""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm 
""

yeah maybe but  i don't think my parents would allow me to
do so       because 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 oh   really 
""
""
yeah cos  they want me to stay in hong kong  rather
than other countries else
 
""
uhm  they just     would miss you is is that all
""
""
""
 miss you  
""
""
yes

country 
$b-laughs

""
yeah
""
""
  she 
 
""
 uhm   uhm 
""
""
  yeah 
""
yeah my grandma   yeah 
""
yeah i don't know
""
""
 grandmother  
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
so she must worry when you come to overseas 
""
""
what   pardon 
 
""
 she   must worry if you told you go overseas 
""
""
yes
""
in uh she she  afraids  uh to stay in home at night alone
""
because 
$a-and-$b-laugh   she she  ' s afraid darkness
 
""
oh   really  
""
""
 uh yeah   yeah
""
so i have to stay at home every night
""
even i i go i i have a late  party or   stuff 
 
""
 uhm   uhm 
""
""
yeah     it  ' s hard
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
wow
""
don't mind make a joke of it
""
but she can't just leave the lights on 
$b-laughs  
""
""

""
""
can't can't just leave the light on 
$a-laughs

can't just leave   the light on  
""
""
 because can't she leave   the light on

already
""
uh she wants someone to stay with her especially at night

 yeah  
""
uh ha 
""
""

""
she  ' s maybe a kind of suspicious    suspic  
""
""
 uh  
""
i no i guess perhaps your grandma is  doesn't really afraid of
darkness
""
she is afraid of loneliness    
""
and she    desper  she  desperate of  comp
 uh of companying
""
and you are the only one available
 
""
 yes   
""
""
 i don't know  
 
""
that  ' s right 
""
""
yes
 
""
there if you got her a boyfriend 
$a-and-$b-laugh 
""

""
i  ' m sure 
""
""
but but i have i have make a promise
""
i make a deal with   my grandma 
 
""

""
uhm i don't know
""
but i think we can  have more  varieties of stuff we can buy
in japan
""
even though uh in hong kong now we have a lot a lot of japanese
stuff
""
but  i think i can find more special and cannot be found in
hong kong
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
yeah
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
actually i  ' ve been to tokyo before
""
and i have  and my uncle just took me to a street in tokyo
""
  and  that street is and i
""
you can buy a lot of a lot of  uhm accessories  
necklace  rings whatever
""
there  the very very  cheap price
""
and actually if i  if i  ' m going  to japan next year or
later
""
i  ' ll go there again
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yes  
""
yes
""
""
yeah
""
""
holly would you like me to buy some stuff for you when i  ' m
in  jap  
$b-laughs 
""
you can make a list for me
""

""
you can send me some icq message because i can check it out in
japan   yeah 
""
""
  yeah 
""
""
 really  
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
i think
""

""
i  ' ll send you a list
""
 don't  worry 
$b-laughs 
""
""
 yeah  
""
on the other hand you can you have to buy me some souvenirs when
you go to italy  or   russia
""
ha ha ha ha 
""
""
 uh i  ' ll tell you if   i can go
""
i really   don't 
""
""
 yeah   you can make it
""
""
i  ' m  i  ' m not very sure though  uhm 
""
actually i i  i guess i can just afford to go  to either
russia or italy    
""
i just don't have enough money to go to   both trip 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 can they   overlap anyway don't they 
""
""
no
 
""
they don't 
""
""
because the   russia 
""
""
 the time   clash
""
""
no
""
because the russia trip is from late june to late july
""
and the italian trip is from early august 
$a-laughs 
""
""
wow wow wow
""
""
actually it will be perfect if i can go both places but
""
wow i just don't have enough money
""
""
have you tell your parents about  the the two trips
""
""
i have told them but uhm i guess i need to  i still need
to persuade them to pay 
$a-and-$b-laugh 
 
""
you could hit overland from moscow to rome
""
and let use the trip hong kong moscow path of the trip
""
and the rome   hong  kong back of the trip 
""
""
 wow  
""
yeah cool
""
""
uhm i don't know if i can
""
you mean i i just go to italy after   after a month 
 
""
 yeah just   meet them there 
""
""
no it  ' s
""
i don't think the uhm the people
""
i mean if i join the russia tour i i mean the lecturer the
professor or the people  would allow me to do that
""
actually they did they don't even encourage me to stay behind
""
yeah
""
""
why
""
""
so   and  because i guess probably of security
problem
""
and you go in a large group and  so your safety is the
responsibility of the hong kong university
""
so it  so we got to stay in a group most of the time
""
and  no going out after  yeah after lecture or something
""
""
 because  
""
so if you if you    if you   join the russian
trip
""
  you will  stay where
""
""
 if i join the  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uh we will stay in    the  accommodation will be
arranged by the  hersen   ho  university
""
  yeah i  probably stay   in the 
""
""
 and uh  uni   
""
 oh yeah  
""
 you stay   dormitory
""
""
yeah  pro  maybe
""
we get a share room  that  ' s what they told me
""
""
yeah
""
""
but uhm  anyway i
""
it  ' s not sure and  i know that they would have the draw
""
it on in early may
""
  yeah 
""
and so i  ' ll know by then
""
""
 early may
