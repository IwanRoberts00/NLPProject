there ' s two way of doing it
and then later we ' ll talk about the thesis databases
there ' re two of them
one is called proquest digital dissertations that they claim that
is a international database that cover all areas including hong kong okay
but actually uhm the main theme is uh from united states and also
canada okay
and the next one that i will show you is index to thesis with
abstracts accepted by higher degrees by the university of great britain and
ireland
so this one is more specific unlike the first one okay
so far any question
no okay
now hong kong u thesis
hong kong u university thesis online that we can access
how can we access it
the first one you can access it from our homepage okay
i ' ll show it to you 
you can have your hands on too if you want to
and go to our homepage
this is our homepage
and then you go to hong kong ul digital initiatives here
you click here
and then there are so many databases which are created by
university hong kong or hong kong libraries
and one of them is called hong kong university thesis online okay
so you just click this in hong kong university online okay
so this is uh description telling you what is inside here
because uhm the thesis are from different departments so the
beginning date are various
so if you want to uhm see uhm the beginning date ex cetera you can
go through the description here
and you can have the whole thing about the database about the
collection
how many are inside there
and how can you access from it
and there ' s the description to it
so you just click here okay in this button
and then you will go to this one
okay
to this page
now there ' re several ways of finding the university of uhm thesis
you can either search that means you can just key in certain
keyword here and then you can do the search from here
for putting the keyword here there ' re several way for you to do
this
searching
you can put the keyword as anywhere okay
you type in the keyword and then it may appear anywhere of the
record
the keyword as part of the title okay
the keyword as the author ' s name
the keyword as the subject
so these are choice for you okay
there are four choices for you
you can use it and type it in any of the keyword and then select
your own choice
it means anywhere that means uh you will get more citations more
dissertations but it may not be at as relevant as that you will use it as the
keyword as title or the keyword as the subject
okay
so it ' s all up to you or what you want to do okay
now let ' s one want to uh find something on quality education okay
so i just type it in 
now i type the keyword quality education because i don't know how
many will be there for quality education okay
so i just type this in and do a search okay
if i do a search like this they will give me three records
okay
three records of it
and the first one that is a lady ' s name leung pui ling okay
and the title is achieving ed uhm quality education
and we have two copies within the library
the first one is in education library
the second one is in special educations
most of our thesis are in special collections
and all of them they cannot be checked out
you must use it within the library itself okay
now down below here that you will see that the publishing year is
two thousand and one
and the language is in english
how thick is the thesis
it ' s one hundred and seven leaves okay
it ' s not that thick
it ' s like that
and also the department of this thesis is education
and this is our higher degree thesis because we only keep higher
degree theses within the university library
so the degree is master of education okay
and also there are subjects for it
high schools principals china hong kong
and from the subject you will see you will know that what is about
in the thesis
for example total quality management in education china hong kong
okay
this is the subject of it
and down below here there ' s also hong kong subject
that library of congress subject headings are those that created uh
from our library of congress subject heading that means it ' s from united
states subject heading
they they have a whole list of subject headings and then we go
through the thesis and we find out this subjects are more appropriate so we
just select it
but in hong kong collection that they also give hong kong subject
because uhm in hong kong we don't put down china hong kong
we just give the subject because everything inside in special
collection most of them are about hong kong
so we just put under chi uh secondary school principals
and then you understood that hong kong is the heading of it okay
so that means the subject heading is secondary school principals
but in hong kong okay
so in uh the ho uh hong kong subject there ' s no hong kong
there but is understood that is about hong kong
and also here that you will see the table of content
oops
don't know what ' s wrong
suppose you can see the table of con oh i i ' ve i had
actually asked my colleague to fix it already
if you click the table of contents
the pdf you will see the table of content and also the abstract
uh just excuse me uh let me uh asked them to redo it again a
pause 
let ' s redo it again 
now okay this time that cantonese speeches , confirming the
programme fixed 
now let ' s redo it again because something wrong with it and my
colleague has just fixed it
now you will see that there ' s the table of content okay
and there is only one page because is only the table of content
okay that ' s all
and also you can see also the abstract the summary of them okay
the summary of the database uh of uh this particular thesis okay
so this is no full text yet
everybody can get it
no unidentified speeches 
so this is the way for you to search uhm by keyword
and also here that you also can limit by title
for example if you want uh quality education as part of the title
and then you can click to it
but i ' m afraid there might not have anything so i just uhm use
quality
for example i use title 
okay
now just like this one that we will find quality as part of the
title okay
and the second one quality as part of the title
so now limit quality that word must appear in the title okay
if you want it as part of the subject quality the word quality as
in the subject so you see here that is quality as part of the title
so it ' s of your own choice that you can select the keyword as
part of anywhere or that word appear in title or that word in the subject or
you can select author
for example the author ' s name is 
i put down chan there
and now the computer will select every author ' s last name is chan
for me 
okay
and then you just check
all this title the author ' s name is chan okay
okay all right
up till now that you can search some keyword search yourself and
to see if you can find some title before we go on to do our limit search by
date by programme degree language ex cetera
i give you three minutes and then you can test a keyword and you
will find some citation yourself
if you have any question you just raise your hand a long
pause, tape stops and restarts 
by using it as a keyword and also uh if we have too many citation
for example if i just put it china there i might find a lot of titles
too many of them okay 
if you find too manys uh thesis on this particular subject or you
might want to limit it for a certain period of time
i only want the recent uhm citation but i don't want the old one
okay
we have too many
now just like this
i find fif uh five thousand three hundred and thirty
three citations with the word china there okay
there ' re too many of it
so i might use it to narrow it down to only find those s 
thesis published after nineteen ninety to two thousand and three okay
or i might also limit it with a degree
for example i just want ma not others okay
or i only want language english
so there ' s also choice for you to do the limit okay
it ' s all up to you
now from five thousand something now i limit it to the ma degree
and i only can find one hundred and fifty of it okay
so this is uh one of the way for you to narrow it down okay
so you can try to limit it okay
give you some time to do a try
you can type your own topic and s try to search if you
can find some thesis okay unidentified conversations in cantonese , a
long pause 
now this one is uhm using the keyword search okay
now you might also not using a keyword search but you just want to
browse around to see the department to see how many thesis in that particular
department you just want
for example i want anatomy
i d i i don't know uh what keyword
i don't have any idea what i ' m going to write my thesis
i just want to get some idea from the old thesis
so you might browse around and then you just click there and you
select all and then you search
now this time instead of giving you the keyword because i haven't
typed in the keyword but instead i type in the department so now give you all
the thesis from anatomy okay
so there ' re how many of them
total fifty seven are from anatomy okay
so you can do in this way by browsing uh by department by the
programme or you can also click here
here is browse by department of programme you click here and then
you select anatomy
i don't know why this figure is more this time
something wrong okay
you can do either way actually
now uh i will uh tell you later on
now just like this one
there ' s no full text here
but i will show you the other one is has full text later
if there ' s a full text like uhm uh one guy has uhm go into it
and there ' s a full text
for example just like this one 
this one has full text
full text body okay and then you can click into here
yes if there ' s no icon
i tell you
just like this one there ' re the full text is there
two hundred and seventy two pages
and then you can go for it
but as i told you before this databases this database we do not
have all of those uh entries have full text
we only just have couple of them have full text because we just
start to have the full text since last year okay
so if you don't have the full text you can either use the title or
use the author ' s name into our dragon our catalogue
for example this one okay and then you copy and paste
you go to our dragon catalogue go back here and then use
title and then i paste the title again and then i type
so there ' s thesis
here for you to view the uh electronic thesis and here ' s the hard
copy and give you this number
the location is is special collections
the status is available okay
so here if there ' s no full text online and then you have to go
back to our catalogue and check the call number for it
actually there ' s a call number there
you just can get the call number and go upstairs
go upstairs and uhm to uhm our special collections okay an
inaudible question no you have to use it within the library
all the thesis cannot be check out except those thesis are not
from hong kong u from other li uh from other university then you can
borrow it okay
but i will talk about it alter on okay
anything unclear for uhm browse by department and also you can
browse by degree okay
for example master of arts in education then you can browse around
with this uh thesis
that ' s the call number here
okay anything unclear so far
 an inaudible question uhm is it all depends on the author
you know uh when they gave us the thesis and then we asked them to sign a
page and then we ' ll paste it at the back
if they allow if the uh author mark it that allow xeroxing and
then we will let the user to do some xeroxing but of course is governed by
copyright law okay
the law of copyright okay
so it all depends on the author
some of them they even don't let other people to read it within
three years within two years or never want anybody to read his the
 he his or her thesis okay
