 
""
okay
""
what  ' ve been happened with you lately anyway 
""
""
uh
""
i  ' ve been very busy
""
you know uh  the whole month
""
wow the end  the rest of this month
""
and the next month which is december
""
every night pretty well book by member with different function
""
  you  know close the christmas
""
and then we get our little christmas break
""
you know and then new year    
""
but up to then i  ' ll be very busy
""
uh well arranging payment and membership
""
and arranging function and all that
""
and staffing while i don't have much problem except the uh 
""
you know the part-time so unreliable you know    
""
and yesterday i had  one day off
""
i went up to china to have a friend of mine in china   who
 had a hotel up there    
""
so i took one day off
""
and then the same day which is yesterday
""
and two part-time didn't show up you   know 
""
and it was
""
this is how you know  one-word 
""
the whole place is pretty bad i mean
""
when i came back today
""
this morning i heard of that so  of be  bad you know
""
i wish i i i didn't go
""
  but  then again you know  tut 
""
some  thing like that is  unforseen
""
you know i mean i
 
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
 yeah  
""
  really  
""
""
 i know  
""
does
""
because the part-time so unreliable
""
they don't show up
""
fine they don't get pay
""
and  in  it  ' s not like a full-time  worker you know
""
they have different contract you know
""
you can't of type them in you know    
""
so that  ' s  the one difficulty one displace is staffing 
 
""
especially  when you need them the most
""
you know like monday 
$z-laughs  usually is the busiest day or or  of the week
""
and then uh it is
""
while my daughter  don't have to go to school at  this this
 side 
""
you know to stay with   her  
 
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 uh uh   
 
""
  so i  
""
""
 fine  
""
don't come to work dear
""
  so that  ' s  what happen here
 
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
  uhm i also  
 
""
 yeah   
""
""
yeah and then
""
wow for members
""
they don't they don't care
""
they come here they want good services good food and also
""
i mean it  ' s hard to please everyone at uhm in this in this place
""
  just  like   th  three or three weeks ago
when  tut 
""
we have  problem this supplier
""
you know the one who supply the  bottlen  and the  napkin
drop  and  napkin little
""
it is same company
""
and that company is the sole agent in hong kong    
""
and what happen the story was
""
they decided not to give out credit to any company because
""
when i talk to guy
""
finally they  ' ve been screwed up so many times
""
you know like 
""
they been delivering beer to different restaurant hotel and pub
""
some restaurant change hand change owner
""
or decide not to pay them
""
  so they lost 
""
i i i can sympathy with their   decision 
""
but  the problem that we have is
""
we can't buy good in cash    uh 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 oh  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 right   right 
""
""
you know  it  ' s against the into the rule
""
the  lika   ru   lika  rule
""
and besides i  ' m sure the uh  the taxation do not appreciate
that much
""
because when you
""
i  ' m sure park'n shop sell those beer
""
but i can't go and buy them
""
and secondly  you don't know how much you need  right 
  
""
and if you buy from park'n shop
""
let  ' s say i i bring  two thousand dollars cash all my  barry
 cash    
""
i buy lots of beer    washington  
""
so we don't have short supply right    
""
but what happen at the end of the year
""
you can claim you don't do that kind of business 
""
you do less because when you pay cash  that  ' s unrecorded
""
you understand what i  ' m   saying 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 oh   yeah yeah  yeah
""
uh   uh uh 
""
""
 you see  
""
so for lot of owners of restaurant clubs they do that
""
they buy cash from seven eleven
""
even higher price they do that
""
and then they sell they get the profit from the uh from the
customer
""
  and it  ' s  unrecorded   right
""
so at the time at the  end of the year they do fill in the
tax form
""
the business strict right
""
but actually it was expanded
""
  you see that  ' s uhm 
 
""
 uh  
""
 right  several words   
""
 uh uh uh uh   
""
""
but members don't understand that
""
they were so mad and uh
""
they wrote on uhm his suggestion book
""
and do a little bit harsh on me
""
  uh 
 
""
 we   don't do it you know
""
you don't do it for others
""
you don't consider  the benefit of the members 
one-word  
""
""
i mean 
""
i  ' m not the owner here
""
  if  i uh if i were the owner    
things are different
""
  it runs  differently   right
""
i  mean even the financial office would not let me do that
""
because uhm  i mean the credit cash is not for that purpose
""
especially   talk  with three times a month
""
that i pay in two three thousand dollars cash to buy beer
""
i mean  you can't do that
""
so finally i strike a due   tut  with the owner of the
from that company
""
we find it economy
""
and then we can order  a week ahead
""
and then try to get a cheque ready at time of delivery
""
yes up to that
""
so we okay
""
you know what i mean
""
well   you have to go 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 i have so that  
""
that  ' s still us like
""
they they want undelivery
""
they want the pay 
""
""
 tut  they want to   get pay  on delivery
""
  yeah 
""
and no
""
they have the committee that  ' s what they decided and no exception
""
i mean     they feel sorry for me
""
you know wow i  ' m sorry i know your club
""
you  ' re belong to the hong kong u
""
and  i  ' m sure your credits are good
""
but once a policy made as no exception
""
because you  you start making exception to one company
""
and then uh the other committee members say  ay 
""
that company i knowing well too
""
why can't you make exception
""
i do
""
i can understand that
""
but uhm members they don't understand that
 
""
 uhm  
""
  several words   
""
 uhm yes   
$z-laughs  
 
""
uhm  uhm 
 
""
are you all group raise  leijin  you know uh
""
world will be there is like  a   riot  will be there
 happen or something
""
uh  tut  jesus 
 
""
 uh  
""
oh well
""
not friendly ask 
 
""
well uh  uhm 
""
""
you want something to drink
 
""
no i  ' m fine
""
so anyway i  ' ve been lan kwan fong and a long time
""
anything much happening down there 
 
""
right 
""
""
well uh
""
i  ' ve been there  couple times uh 
""
wow
""
last month
""
and especially on the halloween night
""
it was   a riot 
 
""
 oh you went  
""
oh you went 
""
""
it was a riot
""
while i stay for very short while
""
  because it  is wait too many people one place
 
""
 uh uh  
""
where is it 
""
""
but the uh got to get credit to the hong kong police
""
because they did a good job
""
you know like they  session it up
""
and how  patrol the people
""
you know direction to go in and out and also
""
they did a very good   job 
""
and the uh as far as costume are concern
""
there  ' s not too many people  were  doing deliberately
""
doing customue for the halloween
""
but lot of people went there  to watch   other people
wearing costume of 
""
i was a  li  i was a little bit disappointed  tut 
""
but after all is a good time
""
and then i realize that there  ' re so many new bars open up in lan
kwai fong
""
you know uh   it just  like the whole street every
   
""
every spaces fill with   bars  and restaurant 
  
""
so it  ' s kind of unique in hong kong
""
you know to have that kind of uh area set up in hong kong
""
and not to mention the  ton of tourists
""
it i believe  it  ' s a kind of  uh tourist attraction  in
hong kong now
""
besides the peak uh
$z-laughs 
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
yeah so uh
""
yeah probably would be
""
uh i  ' m in down full
""
i got uh
""
oh what i like i go i  ' m used to same the places i know
""
  because  
 
""
 uhm uhm   
 
""
i  ' m exploring some of   the places  
""
""
 same as   in wanchai
""
i heard there  ' s a nice big bar open up in wanchai
""
right across the banana
""
it  ' s downstair in the basement
""
have you been there
 
""
is that one uh  the big apple 
""
""
 tut  is that what it  ' s call
 
""
  uh  yeah  that would be
""
yeah i have been there 
 
""
 i think so   
""
""
yeah
""
is it   was  it good
 
""
 yeah  
""
uh yeah
""
yes it  ' s okay
""
not uhm like  thinkly like  mayic corridwe 
""
there  ' s i got    two-words   
""
""
 who was the attraction   of the bar like  
 what  ' s  the game there
 
""
 uhm  
""
a kind alike  madtoon  type of attraction
""
uhm   you know  
""
""
 dancing   and
 
""
yes there  ' s dancing
""
little dance forign star with uh 
""
""
but if you know show band uh
 
""
no
""
dance discourse
""
and uh  it  ' s kind of cd
""
i mean i like a new show like uh
""
it  ' s not a real cd but it  ' s uhm  like not expensive
""
it  ' s just cheap  enter  the market
""
so you got a lot of the expect kind of  one-word
 good beer
""
and then  those you know
""
the the gather i don't know what they doing
""
and they like filippino   several words  
""
""
 no they shopping  
 
""
well  all-laugh  
 
""
yeah maybe i don't know
""
if i there i will some like that
""
but they  ' re gather around you look
""
you know like do a home they once should
""
and they came to get a job and a proper  
$a-laughs  proper club
""
so that they can't work in the street and we are 
""
""
we  ' ll go to street you know 
$z-laughs  like
 
""
but 
""
""
what about the   new place  in tsim sha tsui
jonathan
""
it  ' s called planet hollywood
 
""
 what they are  
""
i don't    two-words   
""
""
 very good   food yeah
""
  you can have wine 
 
""
 yeah have you   have you need
""
actually i just start to drink  canal 
""
it was quite  fall 
""
but i thought i would go buy
""
look like the prices not so bad either 
""
""
actually i would go to say then
""
not to mention the price not so bad
""
  it  ' s  worth it because     for
example the barbecue rib which is one of the most favourite item on the menu
   
""
and it was hundred and 
""
let say or  ha  hundred and fifty or hundred and
forty something   dollar  
""
but it  ' s a big thing
""
like   deportion  about size like that   
""
and actually  
""
when i came  caution    exactly 
""
and you can actually like  the two local hong kong people
""
two people can share   that   and feel you 
 know no problem
""
so  consider that     i mean the price
could be low
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
 yes that  ' s good  
""
 uh  
""
 uh  several words   
""
 uh uh uh  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh ha ha ha  
""
 uh  
""
uh ha 
""
""
and the drinks are about thirty forty dollars
 
""
yeah i was surprised i thought maybe uh others so expensive 
 yeah be very high     society   kind of club
""
 
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah you  ' re right   
""
""
it  ' s alright
 
""
uhm 
""
""
and then
""
most of the time can run a lot of famous movie stars
""
and  politician     and high society and  thing
blue 
 
""
 uh ha  
""

 uhm  
""

""
because thinking of the snake soup they had last night you know

$z-laughs 
""
so   that  kind of thing you know
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
but uh we don't
""
but also did
""
we are having a lup  uh disable out there having difficulty
financize
 
""
uh 
""
""
yeah  tut 
""
so i get it all
""
i had make sure 
""
all everything goes well before i i take a trip up there

""
 uh  
""
yeah sure

""
what about this uh shooting range that

they shooting m sixteen or are they ak forty seven or something
uh 
""
""
right all we usually just go up there uh  tut
