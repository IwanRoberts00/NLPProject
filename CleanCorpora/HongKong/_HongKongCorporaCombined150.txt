yes uh thank you chairman chairman i want to welcome the foreign secretary to this council and to thank him to congratulate him for having the courage to have this open meeting with us which none of your predecessors have ever dared to do although of course the governor does it regularly and uh as the chairman said foreign secretary my question is on citizenship during your very brief stay here i ' m sure you have talked to a lot of people and i think there is one issue in which this community is united uh if you talk about democracy and others you may hear different views and even on the representativeness on on representation on the preparatory committee of which the de pro-democracy lobby has been completely excluded you will hear different views but on the question of british citizenship this whole council the hong kong government and the governor we are completely solidly united we want your government to reconsider offering full british citizenship to the three and a half million hong kong british subjects not all of them will take it some of them will want to be chinese citizens good luck to them but there are those who don't want to  and foreign secretary earlier this afternoon when you spoke to the two chambers of commerce you said that during your six months as foreign secretary it only increased your admiration for the courage and the clarity of vision with which governor patten has led this community  well governor patten is solidly behind us is nationality a blind spot of the governor or you think the governor has been very seriously misguided and also foreign secretary finally you said in your speech you will discharge britain ' s responsibilities towards hong kong fully and honourably how can you do that if you abandon britain ' s citizens to chinese communist rule no independence no self-rule no autonomy no guarantee for participation in the political affairs for for the rule of law for human rights how can you do it foreign secretary speech-by-foreign-secretary chairman yes my question is not on the british nationality selection scheme i ' m sorry foreign secretary you are wrong i ' m talking about full british citizenship for the three and a half million hong kong citizens  the scheme the bnss is woefully  inadequate  and of course if you would want to broaden that i mean that is a  ri a step in the right direction but i ' m talking about your government your country ' s responsibility for the citizens that you ' re going to hand over to chinese communist rule  do you not have a conscience do you not think it ' s disgraceful to hand these frightened people over to a regime from which they fled and to which the british have given them shelter for so many decades speech-by-foreign-secretary     well a short floor     yes   that ' s what i ' m talking about   uhm   uhm   yup   yup    mrs selina chow  question-in-cantonese-with-english-translation  speech-by-foreign-secretary words in cantonese    follow up question-in-cantonese-with-english-translation  speech-by-foreign-secretary    are there any more questions for the foreign secretary on british nationality and british citizenship  christine loh  uh foreign secretary there is particular problem with the ethnic minorities as you well know uh we are told by that community that there are perhaps no more than three to four thousand uh eurasians and people mainly from the indian sub-continent uhm who will be stateless it ' ll be difficult and indeed they do not want to apply for uh chinese citizenship as such in view of the fact that this number is really now a very small number is there really nothing that the british government is going to do you did say just now sir that the uhm uh that there are ethical and moral grounds uh for britain to continue to take an interest in hong kong i mean surely like with the question from miss emily lau the honourable way is to ensure that these people do not have to in any way doubt that they have a nationality after nineteen ninety-seven  speech-by-foreign-secretary    miss loh  yes uh foreign secretary you ' re a distinguished lawyer uhm i ' m sure you know that there is a vast world of difference between having the right of abode somewhere and full citizenship so do you acknowledge that the ethnic minorities will not have full citizenship and if not why do you want to make them wait till after nineteen ninety-seven to see if there is a problem in order to solve really what is now a very minor problem in human terms several-speeches uh foreign secretary i ' m glad to have so many times that i can address you today uh you did say today at uh i believe uh a luncheon to the british chamber of commerce that a successful transition means much more than a smooth transition and that you said the objective of a successful transition is served by britain ' s unwavering determination to do whatever we believe to be in the best interest of hong kong and then rightly you go on to mention that you felt that there ' s no reason for this particular legislature to be liquidated after nineteen ninety-seven uh i think this council was uh quite disappointed with you when  qian qichen was in london uh where he made some comments about the possibility of uh again liquidating this council but you seem to have just stood by and not respond but in any case you do have a chance now to go to china how are you going to demonstrate this unwavering determination what we don't want is for you to go to china and then if it is inconvenient to bring this subject up then you don't bring it up how do you think you can represent as you said you said you would go to china and you would communicate and to represent the views of hong kong and i think the views of hong kong is that we do not want to see this legislature replaced by an appointed provisional body  speech-by-foreign-secretary    follow up  uh yes foreign secretary the point was clarified in london but the opportunity i think was missed but this unwavering determination i mean what can the british government do  is there anything that the british government can do or are you just going to stand by in nineteen ninety-seven and see us liquidated several-speeches    mr martin lee  mr foreign secretary i had to leave uh early from the opening of the legal year this afternoon in order to ask a question of you  so lawyer to lawyer or qc to qc can i ask you what you would actually do to using your own words at lunch ensure that hong kong people ' s fundamental rights and freedoms are properly safeguarded if  your counterparts in china were not to listen to your eloquent entreaty in relation to the scrapping of this legco and to be then to replace it with an appointed provisional one and the emasculation of the bills of right ordinance  now just confining to these two important matters what will your government actually do not say no matter how eloquently you may say it  if they if they were to refuse to listen    well speech-by-foreign-secretary    mr martin lee   follow up if i may  now if they were really to go ahead and scrap this legco and replace it with an appointed one that is clear breach of the joint declaration which is a joint uh which is an international agreement surely there is something your government can do by taking the other party to the world court for example has it ever occur to you and you don't have to sit back and lament over us or even pray for us    uh speech-by-foreign-secretary    mr howard young  secretary i ' m i ' m interested to know to what extent the united kingdom government will advise the hong kong government and encourage the hong kong government to in respect to cooperation with the preparatory committee which is about to be set up uh looking back uh about two years ago when the preparatory working committee uh was set up it appears to us in hong kong that it started off firstly with a stand of non-recognition non-cooperation and non-meeting and then at the behest of many in the community it it developed into actual contact and briefings uh but short of full cooperation of course the governor has made quite clear that the preparatory committee is within the terms of the basic law and the joint declaration and therefore there will be cooperation and will be a liaison committee set up uhm but uh liaison committee could mean very simple thing of just passing s messages back and forth or it could mean something more than that pointing to full-fledged uh cooperation i i ' d like to know to what extent this cooperation is to be fulfilled and implemented speech-by-foreign-secretary     howard   i ' d i ' d to uh sub add that i speak also as a member about to receive appointment under the pre preparatory committee uh does secretary real recognise that uh because of the fears of hong kong people that there might uh be created a second power centre which could theoretically undermine the uh the effect of the hong kong government and despite that the chinese government in this director lu ping statement that it would not second power centre that if the preparatory committee feels that it ' s not getting sufficient cooperation and then tries to go on its own to set up a huge secretariat then that is probably what would transpire so therefore does secretary agree that the in fact the more resources and manpower that hong kong government is able to put in to help the preparatory committee put in its work will in fact achieve the result of having uh less need for the preparatory committee to go out and do its own show which i i think nobody including people who are on the preparatory committee want to do speech-by-foreign-secretary    mrs elizabeth wong  mr chairman uhm mr foreign secretary uhm i seek to ask a question which is neither interesting nor provocative nor hypothetical but actually factual and relevant to the fundamental well-being of hong kong and smooth transition of sovereign powers now just to remind us of two testaments this is sino-british joint declaration this is the basic law  under section three two of the sino-british joint declaration and section two of the basic law both the british government and the chinese government have promised us hong kong people a high degree of autonomy  yet nowhere even in your beautiful introductory remark has the phrase high degree of autonomy crept in indeed up to now there is very little evidence which is conspicuous regarding the attention we are paying to this attainment of high degree of autonomy  so my question is a very factual one  it is whether you regard this as it is your duty and your business to ensure that there is this high degree of autonomy and if so what exactly are you doing about it  speech-by-foreign-secretary  uh sir uh i don't think you have quite answered my  question my question is what are the factual evidences of the pursuit of high degree of autonomy everything we see does not point to the high degree of autonomy i mean you know there are sort gives and takes and uh compromises here and there and everywhere including the point just raised before regarding uhm the provisional legislature people are threatening to dismantle this legislature i know you have said uh that you disapprove of that and yet there is no evidence something is done about it and what indeed can be done about and uh you know there is a whole series of things i see no evidence  and not only i many people agree with me that is no evidence that we will be in fact guaranteed the high degree of autonomy it looks pretty on paper it is too beautiful to be trusted in fact so what i ' m saying is that what are the factual bits of evidence that we can get that we will be in fact uh getting it    i ' m sorry several-speeches    i will allow two more questions on that ms emily lau  uh thank you chairman chairman i want to ask the foreign secretary about uh a question on uh violations of human rights after nineteen ninety-seven i hope he appreciates that is one of the you know biggest fears of hong kong people that the chinese government should want to come and settle accounts with its enemies maybe there are quite a number in this council and that ' s why we ' re all going to be thrown out so i think there is real concern and even amongst journalists they are worried and that ' s why they practice self-censorship so after ninety-seven if people should be cu persecuted by the sar government or by the chinese government directly and some may want to seek refuge abroad some may want to stay here and go to prison and be martyrs but some may want shelter what is what do you think is your government ' s obligation regarding helping these people  do you have a special obligation or will you be just another member of the international community who may pay lip service to it and and do nothing speech-by-foreign-secretary  chairman i did ask the foreign secretary about offering refuge i mean that is if they can get out and if they ' re locked up already then uh then i hope you will do what you can to seek their early release like the release of wei jiang shen  but for those who c may of a chance of fleeing do you think britain or can you say right now in nineteen ninety-six and say yes britain is prepared to take all these political or whatever other refugees who may be fleeing the hong kong sar speech-by-foreign-secretary  so chairman the fo foreign secretary ' s saying he can't give us a categoric assurance   miss lau you know perfectly well you ' ve been in politics long enough you know perfectly well  you know you know perfectly well that foreign secretaries cannot give a categoric assurances about hypothetical individual cases of political asylum and you ' d be astonished if i was able to give any different answer to that questions and please don't misrepresent what you know is the only answer that can be given in the kind of circumstances that we ' re discussing   not as long as you    we hope you ' ll be a slightly different kind of foreign secretary  laughter    martin lee  yes uh foreign secretary you you talk about the cabinet uh soon addressing this point i i can uh make a wager with you five hundred pounds to your fifty pounds that the cabinet will say no uhm and uh see what what it ' s meant is that uh this is another proposal coming from our governor when he last visited united kingdom he made another uh took up another matter that is a three and a half million passports for our uh the people born in hong kong and apart from admiring him for his courage and clarity of his  vision are you going to actually back him up or you going to ignore him just as it is being ignored up in beijing speech-by-foreign-secretary why why didn't you back up the governor by accepting my wager   time will tell time will tell  maybe and then we might have a further conversation  well foreign secretary  foreign secretary usually don't one-word  chances can we uh move on to a lingering problem on vietnamese boatpeople with a few minutes left uh mr allen lee  uh foreign secretary before uh i ask you a question on boatpeople i just hope uh and i ' m sure members of this council would uh would join me uh on the way as you say time will time i ' d like to invite you back to this uh council in hong kong january next year perhaps you will answer not so hypothetical question is about provisional legco and uh certainly i hope uh your party stay in power and uh you continue to be the foreign secretary so you could ans answer those questions directly uh by then i ' m sure will be not so hypothetical questions uh my my question with regard to the vietnamese boatpeople this is a long standing uh problem that hong kong uh has shouldered and there is a british undertaking by resolve this boatpeople problem uh by nineteen ninety-seven uh perhaps repatriation but so far still there are twenty thousand boatpeople left in hong kong and no visible solutions only this morning we saw the newspaper reporting there will be a meeting in bangkok uh mid middle of this month now what is the british responsibility towards these boatpeople if if even though you said may be hypothetical and might be become visible that if they are left over in hong kong by nineteen ninety-seven now could you say that there will be no boatpeople leftover uhm in hong kong as a statement uh to the people of hong kong i ' m sure we will welcome that
