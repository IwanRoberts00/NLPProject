good evening and welcome to newsline
""
some legislators have accused the government of giving away hong
kong autonomy in the chief executive election bill
""
the government has now changed the wording but the critics are not
satisfied and will propose their own amendment
""
is hong kong giving away its own autonomy  or does beijing
already have the right to remove the chief executive
""
with us discuss this issue are independent legislator audrey eu 
and legislator tsang yuk sing chairman of the democratic alliance for the
betterment of hong kong
""
welcome on to the programme both of you
""
audrey let me uh start of you
""
  exactly  what is it that you object to about the
wording and the chief executive election bill 
""
""
 yes  
""
well the first of all this course has gone through  various
drafts but  consistently throughout the draft uh there is the reference to
the central people  ' s government removing   the chief executive 
""
that  ' s the part that that i object   to 
 
""
 uhm uhm yes  
""
 i   see
""
and tsang yuk sing do you object this as well 
""
""
well well let me point out uh still
""
in principle uh it is impossible for the  sar government  to
modify any power uh  given by the basic law to the central government uh
central uh people  ' s government    
""
uhm  the any law pass in hong kong cannot act or subtract uh
from  uhm  what are what is already there in the basic   law
""
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yes  
""
but but i thought you are unhappy about the original wording
""
i mean if if that the case you cannot add a subtract from
""
why were you concern about the original wording 
""
""
i was concern because the original wording  did give people
the impression  that there is a arbitrary path  uhm in  
beijing   to remove the chief   executive 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 but   that  ' s just an impression and doesn't really
change the basic   law  
""
""
 and   and and politically  that is very uh 
unwise
""
  and  and it is unnecessary i don't think  
biggest 
""
well whether  beijing has the path to remove the chief executive
  or how   uhm arbitrary that path   is  
""
well it  ' s an important question   and  and it is very
interesting alright
""
but i don't think it is relevant at all  to the uhm uh c e
election bill because because  whatever the power uh there is  
  or we have to  you know it uh the chief executive according to
the basic law
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
so uh audrey why why are this  one-word  then
if if the wording isn't that important and uh   what  ' s it in basic law
 
""
""
 well it  ' s the wording is that   not uhm not that
important i don't   see that
""
yeah yeah i   to   i agree with him in one sense
  and which  is that is very unwise   and  it  ' s
unnecessary
""
  but  i mean i i think the the the problem of course
is is far more serious than that
""
but it it  ' s it  ' s unnecessary because this is really a bill to do
with the c e election
""
  it  ' s not  about the c e  ' s removal or the central
people  ' s government path to remove
""
  all you  really have to provide for is to say that
you  ' ve should have an election when there is a vacancy   the vacancy
 can occur and no need to logical circumstance
""
one is that  upon the expiry of a five year term and the other
is if the term is cut short and there  ' s a   vacancy  
""
and uh the the government  ' s bill already provided for the acting
uh chief justice uh sorry the acting chief executive to announce   uh
vacancy  and to specify the date of the vacancy
""
  so you  really don't need to go into central
people  ' s government path   to remove 
 
""
 oh you don't agree with it no good good  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 but do     you  think   
""
""
 no no   the problem is when can we tell and when
can the acting  chief executive tell  there there is a vacancy if it is
not uh you know the normal  ex  expiry of of a term 
""
say  take this uh uh  hypothetical  case for example
""
if the c e  uhm is taken by illness for  uh lengthy period of
time and he really cannot go to office
""
now when can  anybody say  that look  uh the uh he  ' s
already  vacan  let  ' s go for a new election
 
""
uh so what you  ' re saying is that nobody in hong kong can say this
  and we have to wait for beijing  one-word  
""
""
""
 it because because the  appointment    
because the appointment is made 
""
""
 i  i i  sup   
""
 i suppose if the us   government   uh  year
  president is sick then i mean you need some other  supreme
power god to say isn't   it
""
i mean it is it is not  several words  
""
""
 uh  
""
 uh no no may be no it is in the it is in the us constitution
 
""
it is in the us constitution alright if the president  or if the
the presidency become  vacan    then the  vice-president
automatically become president   right  is already want in but
uh   how you know 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 when is it   become  vacan  he  ' s ill
for   two weeks three weeks so 
""
""
 uh that that that   is that is a very interesting
  question
""
you  remember   there  ' s there  ' s there  ' s a american
there  ' s a  american film  air force one alright
""
  the  the the president was taken hostage  by some
unknown  you know force and he  ' s simply disappear from the uh uhm from
from the public
""
you see and   and it  become a very difficult decision
when can we say that the president        that is
 
""
""
 well 
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 if you don't you don't provide  the   
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uh is it  
""
 okay  
""
 let  ' s let  ' s     one-word 
this to hong kong  
""
""
 so what    what he  ' s say we can't  
decide for ourselves we need central people  ' s what    tell 
""
""
""
 no no the   appointment     the
appointment is   made by  the central government  ' s people
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
right
""
but i mean   not in  in in  normal circumstances
uh when hong kong should know first uh whether someone is sick or whether
someone is going away   and  one-word   right
""
and and hong kong informs the central government and the central
government has    what it 
""
so so  why why would  why would you suggesting that hong
kong would know that we would   have to wait to be  three
words   
""
""
 the  cen  central people government right 
""
""
 exactly  
""
 that that is that is what i  
""
 of hong of hong kong can  one-word  of hong
kong knows  
""
that was what i was saying  you remember uh at one of the bills
committee meeting
""
i insisted that any removal uh of the chief executive from office
    should be initiative in hong kong   right 
either according to the  one-word  of uh of uhm uhm
provision in the basic law   or  otherwise   right 
""
but still  the formal process has to be completed by uhm removal
by the central people  ' s government   because the  appointment
was made  uh by beijing
""
so it is for beijing  to declare     right
definitely that now the position the post is   vacant 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 or   uh can we look at what the basic law says
""
everyone says this is to be done and uhm consist with basic law
""
audrey is what is the basic law say about removal of the chief
  executive  
""
""
 the   basic law actually does not say that the
chief chief uh the chief executive is to be remove be removed
""
  actually  it it it is  the the drafting and that
that the uh the wording in the basic law is actually you know very clear and
careful   because there  is a provision that talks about the
appointment  of the chief   executive and  the other serious
 of  uh officials
""
  there is  another provision which talks about the
removal  of the other serious officials   but it does  not
talk about the removal of the chief executive
""
  there is  really  this provision this other
provision in basic law which talks about impeachment     and
impeachment  uh you you first of all have established the ground for the
impeachment and then there is lengthy process   for for 
impeachment to go through   and then  this is going to be
reported to the central people  ' s   government  for decision
""
  so  that that the thing is there is a is a
process i mean you you you don't talk about a bracket  part  
 remove 
""
i mean this is the whole essence of a high degree of autonomy
  that  that even will the appointment doesn't mean the
central people  ' s government can appoint anybody they like it has to go
through an election in the sar   and then  the central people  ' s
government can can appoint this person   they can't  appoint
it   somebody  who  ' s not gone through that post
""
in the same way impeachment you  ' ve got to have reason you  ' ve got
to have processes   and then  this is come from the sar
""
but what is in this bill   is that   central
people  ' s government can remove   is and then you  say  
what why 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 oh no no no  the bill the bill does not 
 say in any way that the central government can remove the chief
executive from office arbitrary
""
no    uh i mean  no no no mean i mean let let let  ' s
be  fair audrey
""
when we say now we are defining when a vacancy   occurs
 alright
""
and the provision in that bill simply says a vacancy occurs among
other things when the chief executive is  re  is removed from office
by the central people  ' s government
""
now  that has to take place if the vacancy is to uhm uhm appear
in the middle of a term    alright 
""
""
 then the government use the word arbitrary it does not
say when  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yes but   would would that actually be the other
way around that would it be hong kong telling central  pes  people  ' s
government that there is a   vacancy and   and and then the
central people  ' s government act accordingly   your point uh uh
another  one-word   
""
""
 yes and what are the central government do  
""
 exactly  but even it that no  
""
even if that takes   place alright  the central
government acts according to     you know some action 
  uh initiated  in hong kong   alright  still not
the central government has to do  is to remove the c e   from
office 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 and and if   the chief executive   had a
heart attack and dies and then  there  ' s a vacancy
""
  the central  government then remove that dead man
  from office  
""
""
 but for we before the vacancy yes  
""
 no death  
""
 no no no   death is the only death is the exception
you know   that i  mean uh there is a separate provision 
 in the  in the uh bill     uh normal expiry of uh a
term death   and  what else now if  if the person taking that
post   a  person who has been appointed chief executive of the
hong kong sar is still alive and his term of office has not ended 
""
how can we say the office is vacant     if beijing
does not terminate that appointment
""
i mean  this is i think very logical
""
it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that by you know putting this
provision   in the in the  uh the oath
""
we are giving a bracket power   to beijing  we have
  no power  to give any talk to beijing   to 
remove the chief   executive 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 what  
""
 what by  
""
 yeah  
""
 what what   about audrey  ' s point that the
basic law which is very carefully drafted over a a period of five years
""
uh was uh it  ' s silence on removal the of the chief executive and
talk only about removal of senior officials   but what  ' s that 
yeah was  that a deliberate act    uh ha 
""
  and why why would say     uh ha and was
it an oversight uh  
""
""
 well i agree with audrey on that point  
""
 yes definitely  
""
""
 you you can't say they forgot  
""
""
 definitely definitely  i i i would no no  
""
it   it it  wouldn't have been an oversight  
 you see 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right so   why why are we now changing things
""
why are we now talking about removing the chief executive when
the   basic  law doesn't talk about removing the chief  
executive  
""
""
 i  
""
 no because   that  ' s necessary
""
because if let me let me repeat   if  the appointment
 is still there    
""
if the appointment has not been terminated and the appointment of
course is made by   the  central government
""
  but if the appointment  still there   how
 can we say that there is a vacancy
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 but why does  
""
 uhm  
""
why doesn't the basic law consider this necessary 
""
""
well the basic law actually  uh is uh uh uh audrey
pointed out early carry a provision  about   impeachment 
""
""
 impeachment  
""
so why why   not say  impeachment is one of the 
  vacancy 
""
""
 and and  
""
 no in  
""
no no don't     we we we can't we can't  
say  that because impeachment itself  as as as provided in the basic
law cannot terminate the chief executive office
""
we know that alright 
""
after an in you know an in impeachment uh uh resolution is passed
by the hong kong sar legislature decision has to be taken  by the central
government no one else
""
the central government may decide to terminate the chief executive
office removing from office or the central government may decide to keep the
chief executive there
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
do you   do you agree that  ' s  the only
circumstance that the the central people government can terminate the
appointment
""
are you say that  the only or you say there  ' re any other
circumstance
 
""
 uhm audrey   
""
""
uhm the other circumstance of course is when the chief
executive uh resign
""
""
and what else   of the 
""
""
 i i   don't think there  ' s any other  
circumstance 
""
""
 well then   well why not adopt the democratic
party  ' s uh uh uh proposal for for community stage amendment which is to say
either impeachment or resigning
""
""
it is   for  logical uh uhm   
 two-words  
 
""
 uh   
""
""
 what if you agree   but that could only be
those two   circumstance why not 
""
""
 no i mean     it is it is not our business
""
it is our business to interpret the basic law 
 
""
 excuse me  
""
 i  ' m i  ' m sorry to interrupt but sorry we we have  we have
  to take a break   uh
""
we will turn  to this right right after the break okay
""
don't go away we will be right back  commercial break 
""
welcome back
""
we  ' re discussing the chief executive election bill
""
now audrey you are planning to introduce some amendment to this
bill is that right what are you proposing 
""
""
 i that i  
""
well uh because i think it  ' s really not necessary in the context
of the chief execution election bill to talk about removal   
 and uh what uhm i  ' m suggesting together with margaret uh is that all
that the bill need to say is that an election should be held  a when
vacancy occurs upon the expiration of the normal five year term   
 alternatively uh when there is a vacancy otherwise and   upon
the  expiration of a normal five year   term 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 i see  
""
 so   tsang yuk sing do you uh have any objection
to that 
""
""
the the the one problem with that uh kind of formulation is
of course uh what i mention early how can we tell that there is a vacancy in
the middle of a term 
""
i mean  well  we need a specific uh  figure  
  
""
uhm who is to say  uh the post is now  vacan  let  ' s
start the election process
""
  right  of course the uh acting chief executive 
uh has the duty to announce the vacancy     but before he or
she can do it    
""
let me stress the the the appointment has to be terminated  by
the central govern
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uh  
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 i i think  
""
i i think frank i mean we must be only place in the world where
the people can't tell when the head of the government  become   
 vacant 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
no no i don't   think so 
""
""
 i i   i i wrote to actually to professor albert
chan of hong kong university and i sent him a copy   of the 
amendment i  ' ve proposed and  one-word  his views
""
and he uh he sent me actually i i got it today this letter that he
he sent to secretary of justice in in relation to my amendment he one of the
things in his letter he say i believe it is a public interest that we should
avoid if at all possible dealing with the question of dismissal of the c e by
the central people  ' s uh by the central government in the c e election bill
""
he said after studying the matter i do believe it  ' s indeed
possible to do so   and he  he quoted my amendment and he also
said in the context of this letter
""
he said it is not  an  a business of the sar government or
the legislative council to interpret the basic law    to provide
 the chief executive election bill that the central government has a
path to remove the chief executive in an under five set of circumstances
""
it  ' s itself  actor  interpretation of the basic law
""
  i respect  for this submit that the sar government
and the legislative council should reframe from making such an interpretation
and hence  one-word  the  province  of the court
and the npc standing committee so far as possible and as discuss about it is
indeed possible and this particular case and the kind of amendment proposed
by audrey receive your   support 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 that right  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 right   so   what  
""
""
 i i   agree completely with uh professor chan  ' s
  remarks that we should  not we should not    
try to interpret the basic law
""
i mean the the the it is not  the business is of the
legislature in hong kong to interpret the basic law right
""
that is why i think there  ' s a problem with the uhm  uh
proposed uh the the amendment proposed by the democratic party   they
are  trying to  they are trying to set up  the uh conditions under
which the central government can remove the uhm  uh chief executive 
 from office  and that is interpreting the basic law whereas the new
uhm uh wording suggested by the government  does not assume  any much
uh interpretation i mean
""
""
 i  ' m glad you do  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm

 uhm uhm
