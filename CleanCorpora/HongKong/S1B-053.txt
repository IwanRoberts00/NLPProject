to wit that in his in the usual flamboyant state the policy
address has indicated that in health care for example there will be more
public hospitals more specialist services etcetera 
in his usual jubilation the governor took pride in announcing that
there will be a five per cent increase in in-patients and twenty four per
cent increase in out-patient service uh of the government medical s 
unit uh service this year
all these are laudable and no one should dispute the principle
improving public health care services
yet until and unless government promises unlimited financial support
 these services could only be maintained at the expense of increasing
staff working hours and longer waiting queues for treatment contrary to
the pledges made by the hospital authority 
with no health policy with no health financing policy to guide us
 with the existing issue of a limited f public fund to cater for
unlimited services we will soon be moving down the failure route of the
problem-laden na national health services of the united kingdom 
sir for years the public the medical profession and different
political parties have yearned for government to come out with a poli
 of a political policy decision 
promises have been made but unfortunately never materialised
 sir this week hong kong plays host to some five thousand
dentists from some seventy countries around the world at the federation
of dental international annual world congress uh dental congress
this is an important milestone for hong kong dentists as it has
found a place in the world map of dentistry
rightly so that deputy to the governor officiate the opening
ceremony to give this meeting its due importance and to symbolise government ' s
commitment to oral health needs and development of the profession
rightly so too that deputy to the governor took pride on the
dental progress so far in hong kong especially after fluoridisation of our
water
but ironically in the same opening ceremony the president of
this international organisation has this to say and i quote 
 in the developed countries where dental caries have shown
a decline but is now levelled-off there is a tendency and a risk that oral
health is considered by the health authority to be a non-issue and so is
ignored in any health policy or strategy 
unquote
sir is hong kong heading this same direction or is hong kong
already there before we begin and has hong kong a proper dental policy anyway
government departments will no doubt come to the defence
that there is an on-going policy which is to promote oral health education
and awareness 
repeatedly governments has denied access to public funded dental
care by the public on the grounds of gigantic cost 
recently the department of health went to the extent of quoting
that only ten per cent of the surveyed population adults had not visit
private dentist because they are unable to pay
in short there ' s no need to provide public dental treatment
services
yet having a general check is one thing but the cost of having your
teeth done up is another which many could not afford 
even the ten per cent together with those receiving comprehensive
social security assistance form a formidable population who needs oral health
care which is wanted 
government has always claimed that no one will be deprived of
sufficient health care due to lack of means
yet when it comes to oral health an important element o
 of one ' s total health it is obviously another story 
government will boost will boast that there are some fifty-eight
government dental clinics and two hundred and eleven dental offices a
seventeen per cent increase since nineteen ninety-two
but do not forget the service is mainly to cater for a
contractual obligation government has made with its civil servants 
even then there is a need to have a performance pledge
for many even our civil servants in this chamber today seek private
dental service on their own being unable to stay in the long queue
it is utmost that oral health care uh must be given the importance
 that it deserve be taken as an essential integral part of total
health care and should in no way be taken as a poor second after medical
services 
a proper dental policy must therefore be developed
it must work with concrete plans to materialise oral health goals
for different age bands of hong kong by the year two thousand and ten set by
the dentist sub-committee the government ' s own advisory body
how much would government consider oral health as a welfare and how
much would government provide as a service for a fee 
it is only with answers to these that a proper dental manpower for
this operation could be work out and a workable ratio between the private and
public dental services could be identified well uh uh to provide a
well-balanced service that we s needed so much
for years government has pledged to provide dental care for groups
with special needs disabled people with special medical condition
etcetera
it is high time these get to going and it ' s high time that the
needy elderlies should be taken also into into its wings
sir while the transfer of sovereignty has everything to do with
land the six million people of hong kong still have to face the problem
of education housing welfare transport and health care irrespective
of before or after nineteen ninety-seven 
it is good news that governments across the board have discussed to
allow children in china who have the right of abode in hong kong to enter the
territory uhm systematically in a bid to ease the likely pressure by
nineteen ninety-seven
it is also right direction for the administration to at least
ponder measures encountering the impact of migrants from china on education
and housing though still far from satisfactory
yet how much how about the impact on welfare health care other
social infrastructure
these areas are conveniently forgotten in the address
instead of blowing its own trumpet being contented in a
short-term achievement in terms of superficial figures now more than ever we
need long-term policies in various livelihood areas
we need direction with vision to guide us into the next decade 
lest the special administrative region will be left a potato too hot to
handle 
one may argue that the virtue of a sunset government should be to
keep status quo
yet beyond the calendar of thir of the thirtieth of june
nineteen ninety-seven it would still be the vast hong kong public who would
have to keep living here breathe here facing a livelihood problems
irrespective of whether it is under the union jack or the red flag with the
five stars 
any responsible government must ensure good governance with policy
directions planned ahead for the subject
sir our government at least owe us that
mr president time will not allow me to go through all the issues
covered by the address
i ' m sure other members will amply reflect their views 
with those words i do so move
i now propose the question to you and that is that this
council thanks the governor for his address
does any member wish to speak
dr david lee
mr president
two weeks ago like a class of new student at the start of term
fifty-nine legislative councillor gather in this chamber
we eagerly anticipate a fresh start a clean slate new lessons to be
learnt new goals to be achieve
but what we got was more of the same from last term
this policy address is no vision
it is a revision
true the administration get top marks for addressing what are
for our community life or death issues housing slope steep slope slope
steep stability health care safety in the workplace
however the administration failed to say anything substantive about
a less tangible but more fundamental subject our competitiveness
imagine mr four-cantonese-words sitting at his desk on
monday morning
mr ho is an entrepreneur the boss of a small trading company that
employ five people
mr ho is reading the morning post
ah he thinks to himself hong kong has been named one of the most
competitive economy in the world
he is proud of hong kong
proud of his hard work makes a difference not only to his family
but to his five employees and to his community
mr ho turn the page
he sigh
inflation has fallen to just nine per cent
he shakes his head wondering if government economists ever buy food
if they pay for their own transport how do they come up with all
these statistics
he folds the paper away and turn to his mail
mr ho open the top letter and shudders 
his landlord wanted to raise his office rent by twenty-five per
cent
everywhere cost is going up and up
he think to himself no wonder orders are falling
people in hong kong cannot afford to go shopping
he has good relationship with the retailers he supplies
over the years he has become friends with many of them
mr ho frowns himself
he knows that like him they are struggling 
then there is a knock on at at mr ho ' s door
mr ho ' s face brightened
it was his favourite employee the hardworking mr -
seven-cantonese-words 
mr dai sits down and begins talk to mr ho
he wants a raise
he is trying to save money to buy a flat but everywhere is so
expensive 
mr ho says he understands
he tells mr dai that he will do what he can and mr dai leaves his
the office
mr ho look back at the newspaper headline one of the most
competitive economy in the world
he wonder briefly who decides these things and how
he wonder what it really means but mos mostly he wonder
how he will make ends meet
think of all the goods the administration hopes to do
think of all the money the administration has spent and is
committing hong kong to spend 
this expenditure is made possible by one by just one factors hong
kong economics competitiveness
only competitiveness can create opportunity for people like mr ho
and his employees
only competitiveness can generate jobs for the unemployed
only competitiveness can ensure funds are available for public
housing and for social services
only competitiveness deliver prosperity
but did we hear anything constructive about our endangered
competitiveness in the policy address
sadly no 
instead we were told the social service are one of the rewards of
our economic success
this is a dangerous fallacy an outmoded att attitude
that must be rooted out as if it is it were some deadly disease
expanding social services are not a reward 
they are the restitution made because an economy no longer
offer each and every citizens the opportunity to earn a one-word
 decent livelihood
if we loose our competitiveness we could become like britain a
welfare state
its people living of yesterday ' s capital and surviving on
tomorrow ' s debt service
is this a state we want ou for our people 
is this what they deserve
and the scientific survey may rank hong kong among the world ' s
most competitive economies
does that help the thousands who are unemployed 
does that matters to the m multi-national who are voting
with their wallets and moving their office and their jobs out of hong kong
the bottom line is this 
the competitiveness of hong kong ' s economy is threatened
the pillar of our success are being weakened by insidious
inflation by disabling lack of skills by crippling land prices and
rental by infrastructural bo bottlenecks
yet the administrations offer no real remedies for these ills
the administration needs to recognise that competitiveness must be
declared its priority job number one
it should establish a competitiveness committee a high-level panel
mandated to conduct a comprehensive annual audit of our competitiveness 
it would examine everything from human and physical infrastructure
to regulations and taxation
it would measure hong kong against our would-be rivals
it would assess where we are against where we want to be 
then it would publish its findings
based on its report the committee could advise the admi 
the administration on solutions 
using this audit the administration would set competitiveness
commitments
the audit would become a vital diagnostic tool as the financial
secretary prepared budget each year
we would not need to waste time or money or misguided effort
because we would know what initiatives were needed
our priorities would be clear 
do we need to adjust our tax policies 
do we need to release more land or are our our 
infrastructual link to the new territories and the st state of
our environment more pressing priorities
whatever we may need an audit would help us present a strong case
as we seek china ' s advice and support
