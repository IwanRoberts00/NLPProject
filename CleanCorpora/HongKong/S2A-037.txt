""
so good morning everyone
 can you all hear me
""
well the  1-word  that i  ' m going to talk about
is supervisor student relationship from a student perspective
""
well  uh in my sense uh the relationship is like uh research partners
 it should be for i think that uh the most part of the
research the implementation part the thinking part should be done by the
student and the uh supervisor act as a  guide  guardian beside me
""
and uhm  so it is through this  int  interaction between the
supervisor and the student that we work out uh a uh research
""
and when i think back  in during the years that i did uh my
research here in the hong kong polytechnic well i find that is particularly
for me frustrating during the very first stage of my research that is uh
between the first three to six months  uh when i started doing research
""
because at that period uh i don't really understand what i  ' m going
to do because of the lack of background of my research field
""
so in this stage i have all the ups and downs and i even  challenge  myself
for many times thinking about whether i should do the research
""
and when i sometimes talk with some of my uh research colleagues now
 especially those who are uh starting their research right away  they
told me that uh they thought that their supervisors expect them to do a lot
not expect them to do but  uh expect them to know a lot about the field
 well
maybe they just think that only
""
but uh i find that maybe there are some lack of communications
between uh the supervisors and the students especially uh in the first first
uh stage of the research
""
when i look back i find out there are a lot of differences between
undergraduate studies and postgraduate studies
""
uh during the undergraduate studies i find that uh most of the
information are are  give  given to me what i require is to study them
hard
 i don't have to do a lot of analysis just have to digest it and
then when i am doing assignments and examinations i  uh just uh uhm put
all these things that i  ' ve digested on paper and that  ' s it
""
but when i  ' m doing research it involves critical thinking analysis
and so on and i think as a a student we need time to get uh uh accustomed to
that
""
and there  ' s a much uh uh difference between this undergraduate and
postgraduate requirements that i find that during the first stage of research
i  find a bit difficult for me
""
and i remember i once talked to my supervisor about that and what he
told me is well really very encouraging
 he told me well for every research
student it is like that
 for the very first stage we have difficulties and it  ' s
better for us to talk i think with our supervisors because i think that he should
he or she should have gone through this stage
 and  well i think he he
they can help us
""
and then the second part i would like to talk about is how often
should a student see the supervisors
""
well as all of the research students have supervisors so how 
oft  how often should we should we go to see them 
 uh once a week or uh twice a week or once a month
""
but i don't think there is an exact uh uh formula which uh gives you
some insight how often should we see but i do suggest that we should see our
supervisors regularly
""
well why do i mean that
""
because from my experience i know that if i have to see my
supervisor regularly it means that i have to push myself at least to give
some results for him to see
""
it may be there are some there are a lot of flexibilities of doing
research here so flexibility may make with  uh for some sometimes uh too
much time so that we we will not uh concentrate much but by uh seeing our our
supervisors regularly for i think it can help
""
and in our group as for example maybe because of uh there are quite
a large number of research students in my department we have some internal
meetings too
""
for our group we have internal meetings uh  twi  uh once
every two weeks and in this internal meeting we will uh talk about uh what we
are going to do in uh next two weeks and two weeks later
""
furthermore we have a presentation which lasts for uh uh half an
hour to uh one hour
 depends
""
well i think it is a very good opportunity for us to express
ourselves because i think that uh irrespective to how good our uh research is
if we can't express and don't know how to tell other people how good we have
done it well i don't  is  i don't think it  ' s worthwhile
""
so through this kind of presentations we can uh practice our
communication skills and how to present ourselves
""
the next thing is about the communication between the supervisors
and the student
""
well uh different people have different kinds of communication but i
think that we have to find ways to uh get you know how your uh uh the
communication skills or uh linkage between the supervisors and the students
should be uh uh established
""
of course these vary from individual to individual i think 
""
and there  uh we should have compromises between the different
styles of the supervisors and students of course
""
i  ' ve talked to some of my research colleagues and find that some
research  coll  uh uh uh students enjoy doing research at night which
may not be uh uh uh same for for for her supervisor so i think there should
we should find ways to communicate and to custom different styles 
""
and then there  ' s the expectation of the supervisors and the students
""
well when i was first uh starting my uh research i  thought
that  my supervisors  expect  me a lot especially at  first
 and then i find i  ' m not competent in that so i i started
wondering whether i should continue to do my research
""
maybe uhm it is only my fault and when i uh talked to my supervisor
about that and my supervisor told me just relax and keep on and doing  wor
 hard work and you  ' ll find your vision and then you know what i  ' m doing
""
so i think that by talking with your supervisor is very important
just to make him know uh it  ' s not only uh uh what my research is going on
but what i  ' m uh thinking of myself
""
and i think after uh doing three years research here in the hong
kong polytechnic i find that i have changed a lot when i compare with uh what
i what my uh style of thinking when i was in undergraduate uh when i was an
undergraduate student
""
i find that i can uh think more uh deeply in the problem try to
think uh analyse more more thoroughly 
""
and i do think that due to postgraduate course here in hong kong or
any other uh countries in the world we can have a different uh mind and well
i think it  ' s worthwhile to have a good opportunity of training oneself
""
uh so that  ' s about it 
""
""
""
ladies and gentlemen  i have a teacher  professor cheung
 he
is a supervisor for many  phd student in china and one day he asked me a
question
 he said do you know what is research
""
i found out the meaning of the word research from the dictionary
and answered research is an advanced and detailed study of a subject so as to
learn new facts
""
and he told me  th  that it is only one of the meanings of
research and the word research consists many other meanings that cannot be
found in the dictionary
 he  said that when you want to learn new facts
you have to face many many problems
 you have to solve them one by one 
""
and in  the  in at this process  you have to search for
the answer of those problems
 you usually cannot find the right answer the
first time  so you have to research for second time
""
the word so-called research means search again and again and again
""
for real research work nobody can go from the starting point to the
destination for a straight line  no matter how well is the plan
""
most of the researcher have the experience of going around and
around about their destination 
 however it doesn't mean that they are
wasting their time and power
""
when they are  looking above  their destination
or problem they can look at their problems at many different angles and have
a better understanding about  uh about their research work about their
research area
""
those experience one can get from research sometimes is more
valuable than the results one can get from research 
""
for research work the role of supervisor is extremely important
 different supervisor has different characteristic and ability
""
some supervisor look after their student very carefully
 they uh
have very good plan  about the research project
 all the students have to
do is to follow the plan 
 everything is under control and everything the
student that is useful for the research work and there is guarantee for the
 for the student can graduate on time
""
and some supervisor gives their student nothing but only the title
of the research work and this title can be changed later
""
the student have to make all the decision by themselves 
 they
have to spend a lot of time and power in just finding out a right way to go
""
 they may spend a lot of time in doing something that is not directly
related to their project and something that cannot be written in the thesis
""
""
the supervisor give all the guidelines may not be the best
supervisor
""
that is because everything is under control
 the student does not have
to use his brain 
 the student  ' s originality will not be trained during
the research period
""
after the student receive his uh phd or mphil degree his problem
solving power will not be improved because he  ' s just following his
supervisor  ' s plan going in a straight line and arrive in the destination within
a very short time
""
on the other hand the supervisor will give who does not give any
guideline may not be the worst supervisor
""
it is because the student has to make all the decisions by himself
""
even in setting out problems he may spend a lot of time to go around and
run outside the problem
 however once he  ' s solved those problem the
satisfaction  he get cannot be expressed by words
""
 several-words  what he get is not as simple as
the degree  but the experience he adopt when he search search uh research
for the answer for his question
""
there  ' s no best or worst supervisor but the fittest supervisor
""
a supervisor whom you think he is the best may not be good for
other student
 at the same time a supervisor who is very bad in your point of
view may be good for some other students
""
the problem is  find a suitable  supervisor

i have just changed the topic of my speech to the
confession of a traveller
 please uhm please start the green
light 
asides
""
well i like travelling 
 what i like about it is that i can show
off my pictures to my friends after the trap trip 
""
but don't ask me where the pictures were taken because i was so
busy sucking up the scenery with my camera that i don't have time to look
around where i was
""
but with my sense of travelling experience i can share with you
some tips about travelling 
""
first of all about food 
 very important thing 
 once i was in
 nepal hiking in the mountains
 the food was so terrible
 everywhere
you go the menu was the same vegetables egg egg uh rolls and things like that
and one day to our amazement there was a  different dish on the menu 
""
as soon as the food came we had three bowls immediately
 it tasted
so good
 it  ' s like food from heaven and what is this delicious food 
 boiled instant noodles
""
so the first tip is  instant noodle
 don't leave home without it
""
""
talking about food i was in a restaurant in taiwan 
 we had a
very good meal and afterwards i wanted to thank the waitress and i said to
her in my  1-word  mandarin  thank you for your
service
 it  ' s very good 
 she had a puzzled look on her face 
 what do my
parents have to do with you she asked 
 later i found out that  i
pronounced the word service   fu woo  in the way that
sounded like  foo wo  parents 
""
so  don't get yourself into trouble
be sure that you learn your
 man   eng  uh your language before you go 
""
language isn't the only skill that you need when you travel
 when i
was in  a train travelling from italy to spain  it was an overnight train i didn't reserve a compartment sleeping compartment so i had to  find a place  to stay
""
everywhere was so full
 even the toilets were piled high with luggage and i stepped on people  ' s toes people  ' s bodies and there
were ahs and  1 word  everywhere that i went and finally i
found a place  to  plant  my feet 
""
the train started to move and  my eyes started to stick together 
""
and that night i learned that i have a skill that i didn't realize
that i have before and that is  to sleep standing up 
""
try this
 develop the skill
 it may help in case of emergency 
""
coping with unforeseen circumstances is another important thing
that you have to learn
""
i was in a shopping mall in america  looking for food i was so
hungry and when i saw some spaghetti my favourite dish over there i wanted
to  rush over to it
""
i sprinted over at the record speed 
 next thing i knew i was in water three feet deep 
""
god give me a hole so that i can escape from
 god didn't listen to
me so i had to climb up sheepishly from the fountain 
""
five men came to my rescue thank god  each holding a card in their
hands 
 do you want to put in a claim  ma  madam 
 i
can give you a good deal 
 so much for prompt service 
""
at the end of every trip i gain weight not from over-eating but
from over-shopping 
""
once when i was in a shopping mall looking for some souvenir for my
brother i explained to the salesgirl  my problem 
 you see my brother is
quite well-off 
 he has a good job
 he has a mercedes benz
 he has a house of
his own
 tell me what would you recommend for a man who has everything 
""
without hesitation she said  how about my phone number 
""
to tell you the truth  if you are a  pho  if you are a
photo maniac  a choosy eater  a confused linguist and an
accident-proned uhm  fumbler and a compulsive souvenir
hunter  my advice is  stay home at your safe place  make yourself a
hot bowl of instant noodles  browse over your photo albums look at your
souvenirs and without the uh without being afraid of falling into the
fountain or having to stand   s  sleep standing up  or looking
for for things to buy 
""
so this is my advice to you
""
good luck and happy travelling
