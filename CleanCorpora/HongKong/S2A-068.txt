<I>
members of the jury it is time for me to sum up the case to you
it is the time when i will give you directions on the law and
explains to you the meaning of robbery and also to refresh your memory on
the evidence
it is my job to tell you what ' s the law is and how to apply it to
the issues of fact that you have to decide
and to remind you of the important evidence on those issues
as to the law you must accept what i say uhm without question
as to the facts you alone are the judges
it is for you to decide what evidence you accept and what evidence
you reject or of which you are unsure
if i appear to have a view of the evidence or of the facts with
which you do not agree reject my view
if i mention or emphasise evidence that you regard as unimportant
 disregard that evidence
if i do not mention evidence that you regard as important 
follow your own view and take that evidence into account
on matters of evidence and facts what is important and relevant is
what you yourself believe is important and relevant
i and counsel are here simply to assist you to come to a conclusion
you must decide the case solely on the evidence that you have heard
 not on speculation about what evidence there might have been
evidence consists of oral testimonies you heard from witnesses in
the witness box it also consists of documents for example the photograph the
sketches
evidence also consist of physical evidence for example the knives
and the various other evidence produced in this trial
for example uhm we have uhm the uh bag as well
statement of witnesses read out to you are as much evidence as that
of a witness giving oral testimony in the witness box
the reason for not calling that witness to give evidence before you
personally is that his evidence is not really controversial and that it was
decided that ex cross-examination is not really necessary
admitted facts are also evidence
these are facts which the prosecution and the defence agreed to be
true and accurate
therefore you must likewise accept that to be so without question
though you are not to speculate as to what is not before you in the
form of evidence you are entitled to draw inferences from facts which you
accept as being established by the evidence before you
in the case of each witness consider whether he or she has been
telling you the truth
and whether he or she has been accurate in the account given
in the case of each witness you may accept or reject or or some of
what he or she has told you
that is no obligation on you to accept the evidence of a witness in
its entirety or reject it in its entirety
it is certainly open to you to say to yourself well i believe this
witness when he said this but i don't believe him when he said that or she is
the case name
the prosecution as i had told you in the beginning of the trail
must prove the defendant ' s guilt
the defendant have does not have to prove his innocence at all
before you can convict him you must be sure of his guilt
and that is the same thing as being satisfied beyond the reasonable
doubt of his guilt
a phrase which you have already heard
let me first tell you what the prosecution needs to prove in the
presence offence of robbery
the prosecution must prove that the accused did together with hau
chuen sum and three other persons steal hong kong dollars seven million
and french franc six hundred thousand which belonged to honourway company
from pw one two and three on the twentieth of november nineteen ninety
two outside elizabeth house
and that at the time when they stole these properties they did use
force or violence to accomplish that
stealing simply means dishonestly taking away the property of
others with the intension of permanently depriving the true owner of such
property
i do not believe that you will encounter any difficulty with the
legal definition of robbery in this case
this is because it is not controversial that a robbery did occur on
the twentieth of november nineteen ninety two as described by pw one two and
three
you will recall that the defence has not challenged the evidence of
these three witnesses as to how the incident occurred
you have heard the evidence of these three witnesses who told you
how two of them went to the banks in central to withdraw the seven million
hong kong dollars and the six hundred thousand french franc for their
employer hon honourway company
you have heard how they were intercepted by four robbers one armed
with a gun and the remaining three with knives who took away the money from
them outside the entrance of elizabeth house
and it occurred at some time after eleven am on the twentieth of
november nineteen ninety two
you have also heard how they saw the four robbers boarded a getaway
car bearing registration number fa two one o nine which was driven by the
fifth man
you have also heard how the robbers escaped in their car towards
the direction of happy valley
then you have heard the evidence of the police officer from the
traffic task force who was at that time stationed in wong chuk hang road with
a radar i believe
he told you that he saw a car with the same registration number at
about eleven thirty am on that day on wong chuk hang road
he said that he intercepted it was a vehicle in order to give chase
but then he lost sight of the car soon after that
he then told you he later found the same car again abandoned in
heung yip road in aberdeen
later detectives came and they recovered from inside this getaway
vehicle among other things
three knives and a max mara bag
i believed from the evidence you will have no difficult in being
satisfied that the four culprits did dishonestly take away the seven million
hong kong dollars and six hundred thousand french franc which belong to
honourway company from p uh pw one two and three outside elizabeth house on
the twentieth of november ninety two with force and violence
and also with an intension to deprive the owner of the money
permanently with his money
if you sure of that then the prosecution has proved to your
satisfaction that the said robbery did take place
the real controversy in this case in this trail is whether the
accused was one of the robbers who committed the said robbery
you have been told that that is no direct evidence adduced by the
prosecution to say that the accused is one of the robbers
that is quite true
the prosecution is not say that someone had seen the accused
committing the robbery
the prosecution is relying on the evidence of madam ng the
girlfriend of hau chuen sum that she saw the accused being involved in events
that took place shortly before and soon after the occurrence of the robbery
 to draw the conclusion that the accused is one of the robbers that
committed the robbery
what you should do is firstly to decide whether you are sure the
evidence of madam ng is true and accurate
and if so to what extent her evidence is true and accurate
it is then for you to decide what conclusions you are sure you
should draw from such evidence which you have accepted to be true and
accurate
before i refresh your memories of madam ng ' s evidence i must
remind you that there is no evidence that anyone of the employees that is pw
one two or three that were robbed on that day was able to identify anyone as
a robber
and there is no evidence before you that the accused was ever
identified by anyone of these employees to be a robber
i shall not repeat the evidence of madam ng in great detail
you will have it fresh in your memory
i will only be referring to her evidence by reference to what the
prosecution seek to rely on
and the the facts says that there exist certain significant
discrepancies in her evidence
and that i will also refer to
the prosecution is not relying on the uh any direct evidence as
i ' ve told you
it is only relying on the following evidence to ask you to draw the
conclusion that the accused must be one of the robbers that committed the
robbery question
and the following are the facts which the prosecution 
relies on
firstly according to the victim ' s evidence as well as the evidence
of the recovery of weapons from the getaway car shortly after the robbery a
total of one gun and three knives were used in the robbery
you recall the victims referring to the use of a gun and the
recovery of three knives
and the victims had also referred to three knives
and madam ng said that she saw hau playing around with a gun
and the accused brought three knives back to his flat the day
before the robbery too place
she gave you evidence as to how the knives were wrapped in tape
and bandages
and she identified the three knives recovered from the getaway car
as being similar to the ones she saw in the accused flat
she told you how she came to see those knives
i will not repeat her evidence on that
and you can also see from the photographs you have in front of you
and also the physical exhibits the three knives to see whether they
uh they look uh the same and whether it is possible for one to tell a
beef knife from another
the defence says that one of the victims i believe referred to
a melon knife instead of a beef knife
and that the defendant also says that four beef knives really look
the same
and it is virtually impossible for one to distinguish one from the
other
as i said you have the photographs in front of you the knives in
front of you
it is for you to decide whether you accept madam ng ' s evidence
the second fact which the prosecution is relying on is that 
also recovered from the getaway car was a max mara bag
madam ng said that she brought the clothes of hau her boyfriend to
the accused home in a max mara bag
much of a different size
pw six that was recovered from the getaway car is also a max mara
bag but it ' s not the same one she took to the accused home
you recall her evidence on that
however she did say that she had quite a lot of max mara bags of
various size at home
and she even went to the extent of saying that she thought hua
might have taken one from her flat without her knowing about it
it ' s a matter for you entirely whether you will accept her
evidence on that
the third fact which madam ng is relying on is that she heard hau
saying to her in the presence of the accused that that they were going to get
money from someone who deserves it
and that the money was obtained by those people in improper way
you have heard what has been submitted to you i can see that it
could mean almost anything
she gave an example of collecting that
it ' s a matter for you as to what interpretation you wish to put
on this conversation
the fourth fact which the prosecution to rely on is madam ng ' s
evidence that at about twelve thirty pm on that day that is about one
hour after the occurrence of the robbery mr hau phoned her up telling her to
meet him at sun kwong restaurant urgently
because someone was in trouble
and the getaway car as you recall was abandoned in aberdeen
the fifth fact which the prosecution is relying on is madam ng ' s
evidence that hau and the others including the accused went to her home in
chi fu garden and were anxiously wanting to listen to the news
they also asked her to buy clothes and shoes for them to change
the prosecution asked you to draw inferences from these unusual
facts as to what might have happened before that that resulted in
such strange behaviour perhaps
the sixth which the prosecution is relying on is madam ng ' s
evidence that hau and the others including the accused were at that time
in possession of a large amount of hong kong currency and also some french
franc
these money they subsequently shared firstly in a restaurant and
then later at the accused ' s home
and you will also recall the evidence of madam ng that she
overheard certain conversations in the restaurant about the quarrel and
it was about being unlucky to escape
the last fact which the prosecution is relying on is again madam
ng ' s evidence that later on when she went on a trip to europe mr hau asked
her to exchange a hundred and twenty french franc for him in europe
