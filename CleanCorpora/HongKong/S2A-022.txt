<I>
well actually uh i believe people are more looking forward
to the question and answer session than uh than a summary from me uh but
given the job i think i will quickly uh reinforce uh certain points uh made
by the previous speakers perhaps uh more from the government perspective
than uh from purely that as one of the speakers here
i think uh paul has given us the probably the most up-to-date
situation on mfn renewal which is again uh probably the most important
issue on our hands in terms of trade policy for hong kong today uh i ' ll just
uh re-emphasise certain points
uh first it is not the non-renewal of mfn that we are dealing with
it is the conditional renewal of mfn that is the most problematic
given that we are only address in conditions and if the scenario
change to one of very targeted conditions then we might not be able to hang
so much on narrow margin we now have in the senate to uphold the president
 1-word 
if we look at it in terms of the margin the margin is really small
 and it is narrowing margin
the latest is that the it is only by margin of 2 words
 and leave the 1-word the election with the
 several-words re-election there might be new faces in the
congress and it can be a new ball game altogether
it that is why the business community the government and uh the
american chamber of commerce also planning a mission next week because the
trading is so much effort in the us right now because we see that
the crust will come probably end of this month latest by early next
month
the other dimension i ' m which highlight is that uh hong kong is in
a difficult position over this issue 
mfn is actually a bilateral issue of between united states and
china
both of them are our largest trading partners
directly we have no roles in this only that our trade into economic
interest such that we cannot afford to be advised that uh but given that
we have no direct status difficult for us to be to play too high a profile
the business sector perhaps uh has a freer hand than the government
because as the hong kong government of the really cannot uh apologise or seem
to be apologise in on behalf of the chinese government or this seem to be
passing judgement on what the chinese government do
so our message has to be a very 1-word one
focusing mainly on hong kong ' s economic interest 
i think that ' s all i would like to add on 2 words
 that
uh on mr wilson ' s speech i think uh he ' s given a very good
analysis of why people have chosen hong kong to be a regional headquarter and
has given you a very good uh or well-reasoned uh forecast of what to come
in the next couple of years
to that i ' ll only add that the factors he has described will
not change in the in the future or in the near future
we don't see any change in the geographical advantage of hong kong
for example
the infrastructure would forever be so strong
we are investing heavily in the new airport new container terminal
there will be further development in our financial assistance
 1-word insurance banking 2 words 
and i must add that hong kong government is also investing heavily
in our social structure the social development in terms of education housing
uh social welfare
so these factor would be strengthened 
i think one point uh perhaps that is not uh in 1-word
 of too much in mr wilson ' s speech is the role played by the
government or the reason of hong kong having achievement in efficient
government structure and the fact that hong kong has a rather minimal
trade policy or non-interventionist policy
i think that should also feature largely in a multi-national
company ' s decision to choose hong kong as a regional headquarter 
i ' ve heard comments that hong kong is the place for trade
investment and hong kong is the place where people can make profit and still
keep it
i think the there should be no doubt that hong kong still continue
with this free trade policy and allow the free play of the market forces in
the years to come
so from these macro reasons i have every reason to believe that
hong kong will still be favour as a regional headquarters for multi-national
companies and in fact the i ' ll be very interested to see the results of the
survey about the several-words the hard evidence in
there to the support of mr wilson ' s that
so so much for the points i want to make and i want to leave uh the
time for questions from the floor now
i believe that uh will be far more interesting listening to for
mr wilson uh than to me 
thank you very much 
will be expecting the demo uhm but it will come only after my
let say fifteen minutes of uh brief introduction about the concept of
creating the winword two point o
uh once again thank you for coming here and spending time with us
you could have spent your time in this afternoon having your
meeting in your office or even more to movie but uh you ' ve chosen to spend
the time with us and i appreciate that
uhm today i have the pleasure of introducing microsoft word for
windows version two point o
the overall strength of this new version is everyday made easy
since we have concentrated our effort in offering tools to accomplish
everyday task 
before i go into uh winword i would like to have uh two slides uh
reminding uh you our honourable guest that uh uh we have been doing okay and
i think we are today one of the largest software vendor worldwide
uhm just a fresh look at uh what we have been doing
uhm physical ninety uh when peoples compare with uh physical ninety
one we grew fifty eight percent in revenue from one point two billion to one
point eight billion in ninety one
it was uh not bad for us and in the profit uhm we grew from two
seventy nine million to four sixty three million a sixty six percent growth
uh in profit
i think uh it ' s only because of uh this kind of healthy growth in
both revenue and profit that could afford us to spend more money in r and d
and give you a better product
and uh another figure uh the latest update is that we have uh nine
thousand two hundred 
remy just reminded me that uh i should say nine thousand two
hundred and two because uh we have two new employee in hong kong
well uh we have uh offices throughout the world and lately we have
added hong kong
uh we have started our hong kong operation in november and so far
is myself and remy
i ' m going to introduce remy to you later
and i have just hired a accountant and then i have a few more
headcount to fill
anyway uh it ' s not a headcount seminar
so uh okay i ' ll go into uh winword introduction 
the microsoft word busy uh business is going great
we have the leading market share in the fastest growing market
on windows we have ninety percent market share 
on the map we have seventy percent share
outside the us we are the number one word processing company
these are all the fastest growing market and accordingly we are
growing very quickly with sixty six average growth the last two years
our worldwide market share is now forty percent compared to word
perfect at forty seven percent ************
we are quickly gaining on them and at the rate we ' re going we
should surpass them this fiscal year ending june nineteen ninety two
now we are paying a lot of attention to uh word perfect because we
know that this is a good product but we are also confident that word can be
even better
and i will tell you why and how we plan to achieve that
i mean overtake them 
our word strategy consists of five key components 
first of all building user focus product writing the best graphical
word processor on the market providing a consistent family of word products
making sure word is well integrated in the line of microsoft application and
supporting the migration to word and co-existence with other word processors
let ' s look at the first one customer focus product 
microsoft is leading the way in creating user focus applications
and the word group is no exception
there are three major aspects to this in relation to word 
user-based planning user-based design and user feedback 
i mention usability testing is an important part of our user-based
product development
we define usability at the ability to get a task done in word
without having to consult the menu no menu and i ' m serious about that
this dialogue box for our print merger helper is just one example
of a feature that went through our usability lab
we got some we got more support calls on this one feature than any
other feature in word
form letters are very common and this was a tricky feature
the average phone call for this was fourteen minutes long so we
decided to redesign this feature with extensive testing in our usability lab
this was this was what you might call an exit test for the lab
if we could make print merge easy we could make editing easy
once we brought users into the lab for testing it became obvious
that lot of people will confuse about the process of creating form letters in
general so we created a visual presentation of the process as the first thing
the user sees when they chose uhm print merge
as you can see the process is laid out visually
you have your data document which you mixes with your form letter
to create the printer documents
just laying this process out visually boosted the usability of this
feature dramatically
in addition we added some other great improvements for print merge
but i don't want to go into detail to uh carry 
several-words word for windows is the most usability tested product
in microsoft history 
in addition to creating user focus product a key objective of our
strategy is to create the best graphical word processors
we hope to maintain our leadership position on this platform as
they grow quickly and become the mainstream platforms for the nineties 
the next uh key element of our strategy is consistency within the
word family of products
there are three aspects to this uhm consistency which are focusing
on
first of all sharing information looking alike
yhe final area is acting alike
we ' re going into detail when we go to the demonstration
microsoft word products also are integrated members of their
correspondent uh platform family for example excel powerpoint and mail
just as with the word family the line of microsoft products share
information look alike and act alike
finally we are focusing on making the move to word easy
we also recognise that co-existence with other word processing
users is also a must
there are two different issues here
one is file compatibility
the other is helping users with the new word processor with a new
word interface 
word for windows is the proven windows word processor
it has been shipping for almost twenty four months as of november
ninety one and by july ninety one we have already ship over one million unit
worldwide
word for window is also available in over fourteen languages and we
have make and we have plans to make it available in over twenty languages in
the near future
having shipped over one million unit not only means that the
product has been extremely successful it is very successful actually but uh
it also means that the there are many users telling us what to improve and
add to the product 
word for windows has won most major awards since it shipped
we are especially proud of the latest major review we won the
nineteen ninety one software digest review
here word for windows one point one was rated uh number one
even when evaluated against 1-word two point o and word
perfect five point one 
now that we have talked about word for windows today let ' s talk
about the design goals for this new version
after getting and analysing user input from different sources
product support surveys letters focus groups users conference et cetera et
cetera we realise that we should concentrate our effort in what really people
do everyday
and to achieve this we set very clear goals 
design the product to make everyday much easier for our users and
 usability test every feature and aspect of the product to make sure that
it is very intuitive and easy to use 
analysing what the users told us and what they wanted to do in
what ' s clear that we had to go back to basics to add and improve basic word
processing functionality and not concentrate only on high end or dtp features
we know that usability testing is very important because great
developers with great input can create great features but usability
testing is very important to make those great feature usable
i see over here usability usable is our keyword and we are very
serious about this 
now that we have covered word for windows today and the design
goals for the new version let ' s talk about the product itself finally okay
now this is how we group the features on this new version
easy access to everyday tools
easily create great looking documents
easy move from word perfect
i told you that we are very serious about word perfect
i ' m going to show you some other feature on word perfect
