""
just one year to go before hong kong reverts back to chinese
rule 
""
it is only natural that feelings in the community are mixed 
""
on one hand most of us proud  that hong kong is reuniting 
with her natural parents
""
on the other hand  it is understandable  that there is a
certain degree of apprehension about the future 
""
most newspaper articles and tv programmes around the world have
tended to focus on the potential exposure and risk  surrounding this
historical event  rather than providing a balanced assessment of the
overall picture 
""
this has not only created a negative perception in the international
community but has also affected local confidence 
""
as a member of both the hong kong legislative council  and the
preparatory committee established by the chinese state council  i have had
the opportunity of working closely  with concerned parties both in hong
kong and in beijing 
""
this has given me added insight  and confidence  that hong
kong will continue to thrive as a leading commercial and financial hub  in
the region well beyond nineteen ninety-seven 
""
 whilst  china will obviously be involved  but hong kong  ' s
future is largely in our own hands 
""
differences in values and attitudes are unavoidable  which is
why china has come up with a one-country-two-systems concept 
""
i realise there are divergent views in the community  but if we
can put all these differences  aside which are primarily political  and
work together on the pragmatic side of things in the near term  i  ' m sure
we can manage a smooth transition  which after all is what hong kong
people really want 
""
confrontation and spreading negative messages  around the world
do not help 
""
they merely create confusion and slow down our economy 
""
take the debate on the provisional legislature 
""
i  ' m not sure how productive it is to continue to argue about this
technicality 
""
when this idea was first tabled by the preliminary working
committee  and through the consultation period  no one came up with
alternative ideas  other than the fact that the current legislature should
serve the full term to nineteen ninety-nine 
""
as we all know  the reform package proposed by the hong kong
government  did not have chinese support and was unilaterally passed
through legco by a narrow margin of one vote 
""
the community was polarised 
""
there was no consensus 
""
the chinese foreign minister qian qichen put it succinctly  
""
 the rice is already cooked 
""
why belabour the point   
""
we need to all work together in the interests of the hong kong
people  in maintaining our position as a leading business centre in the
midst of increased competition  in creating jobs  in helping the needy
 and continue to improve the standard of living  of the community 
""
there is a schedule on constitutional development in the basic law
 which is reasonable  and will be adhered to  albeit shifted by one
year  due to the impasse between china and britain which resulted in the
need to create a provisional body for a year as a stopgap measure 
""
as a city within the sovereignty  we should focus on what we do
best  in building  up  on our economic success and not become too
political 
""
we should all have faith in the basic law and the
one-country-two-systems concept  and that the rule of law  and the
freedoms we enjoy will continue beyond nineteen ninety-seven 
""
china has repeatedly emphasised the importance of maintaining hong
kong  ' s stability and prosperity 
""
let us not destroy what we have built over the years  ourselves
""
""
let us work together  for a better future for hong kong 
""
""
""
at an election campaign george bush then an candidate running
for the presidency told the american people to watch his lips  so today i  ' d
like to tell people around the world  to watch signals from hong kong from
which they will know the shape of things to come in asia 
""
these signals may come from little incidents  what i would call
the  pities  of every day 
""
some of these stories make it to the front pages of newspapers and
others never even get a mention 
""
whatever it is  these stories flash before your eyes in what is
generally described in local parlance as a five-minute fever  and then
quietly fade away and are conveniently forgotten 
""
in my rueful moment  i would say that this is the way of hong
kong 
""
hong kong is like that 
""
every story is a most extraordinary until the next most
extraordinary story comes 
""
take for example a couple of months ago there was formed an
anti-provisional legislature alliance 
""
members of this alliance collected signatures on street corners 
""
there were loudspeaker broadcasts
""
there were slogans
""
it was like christmas  and people are milling around 
""
that was the story of the moment 
""
so what is this provisional legislature 
""
why are people so against it 
""
the current legislature of sixty members is wholly elected on the
basis of a system approved by the laws passed in hong kong in nineteen
ninety-four 
""
however  under the proposed provisional legislature  this
system will be dismantled and replaced by a system of selective appointments
under the aegis of a preparatory committee appointed by china and operating
under the vigilant eyes of china  which will be hong kong  ' s future
sovereign power 
""
but this eminent body of luminaries although of dubious
representative status is nowhere mentioned in either the sino-british joint
declaration or in the basic law  applicable to hong kong when hong kong
goes back next year to china 
""
many say that when one talks of  st  stability and
continuity of hong kong  ' s way of life  and the role of law  the
setting up of a provisional legislature simply does not make sense 
""
some speculate that just as june the fourth was a statement from
the chinese government to the students of beijing  so the provisional
legislature would be a statement to the people of hong kong 
""
it will derail the legislative through train 
""
symbolically or otherwise it will kiss the rule of law  and the
high degree of autonomy goodbye  and we are not even talking about
democracy a hated word to some ear 
""
on the other hand many china faithfuls or chinese compatriots will
tell you with a straight face that the provisional legislature is an
inevitability  not because they want it but because china wants it 
""
what china wants china gets  so why oppose something which is
inevitable anyway 
""
being compatriots we should obey and not cause ripples 
""
smooth transition is just that  not to cause trouble  or
oppose what china wants 
""
many  are  already resigned to the fact that it is useless
to argue with our future master 
""
they say that the acceptable face of opposition is at best  a
form of quiet opposition  or to put it in another way gentle persuasion
""
""
no confrontation please 
""
no open challenges please 
""
why fight it
""
why not just lie down and enjoy it 
""
it  ' s now quite obvious that members of the alliance are mocked 
""
there  ' s also the good old chinese way of killing the chicken to
warn the monkey 
""
for a start on july the first a group of magnificent  eight 
 the core members of this alliance including several leading legislators
 with their return permits in perfect order  boarded a plane for
beijing with the hopeful aim of delivering to the chinese leadership a
collection of signatures from those hong kong people who are similarly
opposed to the provisional legislature 
""
lo and behold  in beijing they were held at gunpoint  had
their travel documents confiscated  and were turned back on the same plane
to hong kong  on grounds of national security  and i do not believe for
one moment that they had even carried a toothpick between the eight of them
so to speak 
""
and the reason behind the strange eviction could be one of the
extraordinary stories one seldom hears this side of the pearl river 
""
it  ' s also reported  that some hapless journalists who
accompanied them to cover the story were asked to sign confessions to admit
the errors of their ways  in having supported this so-called illegal body
""
""
as for me  also a member of the alliance  i too have been
singled out for punishment 
""
i was refused entry to beijing  by having my visa application
rejected 
""
surprisingly and suddenly quite out of the blue  my speaking
engagement at the asia pacific worldwide web conference on the subject of
collaboration via the virtual orient express was withdrawn  by the qing
hua university  one of the co-sponsors of the beijing and hong kong
conference 
""
well i don't know but i hope there might not be other forms of
intimidation persecution or incrimination  in the days to come from some
strange quarters 
""
and i certainly hope that the internet gets on the through train
after nineteen ninety-seven  even though i cannot 
""
but the world moves quietly on 
""
the internet conference in beijing will no doubt carry on as
originally scheduled  with ne'er a ripple 
""
nobody kicks up a fuss these days 
""
and this five-minute new story is overtaken by another headline
story 
""
this time it involves a legislator  of another kind 
""
the honourable chim pui chung a successful businessman was hauled
up on charges of fraud and forgery and is now released on bail  of twenty
million dollars in cash 
""
incidentally it  ' s reported that mr chim denounced his arrest as a
political persecution 
""
whatever wrong the honourable chim pui chung may or may not have
committed  he is certainly not guilty of having had anything to do with
the anti-provisional legislature alliance 
""
so there 
""
this is hong kong here and now 
""
goodbye until the next extraordinary story 
""
""
""
well it seems that this year the people of hong kong can
expect to receive  a big christmas present earlier than usual  namely
on the twenty-first of december there will be a a present beautifully wrapped
and  presented to the people of hong kong 
""
what  ' s in the box 
""
of course the provisional legislature  hand delivered by santa
lu ping
""
this provisional legislature we know will be elected  by four
hundred people  who form the selection committee  carefully selected by
beijing 
""
on friday week ago when the chief executive hopefuls were nominated
by the selection committee  the chinese foreign minister qian qichen 
hailed it as the dawn of genuine democracy in hong kong 
""
yes  genuine democracy indeed  democracy with chinese
characteristics 
""
well let  ' s see how democratic the whole process was 
""
on the twenty-sixth of january this year  there was this famous
handshake  that we all witnessed on our television screens  when the
chinese president jiang zemin  carefully selected  and of course the
members of the selection committee enthusiastically voted 
""
as for the provisional legislature  nobody can become a
candidate unless he or she has the support of ten members of the selection
committee 
""
now we all know  how democratic these members of this selection
committee are 
""
well you won't find ten of them who can with any stretch of the
imagination be described as democrats  so  is it easy to find a real
democrat to be nominated  not to say elected 
""
but even then  i think mr lu ping will have a big headache 
""
is he going to give all these four hundred people a completely free
hand  or is he going to direct them how to vote  on the twenty-first
of december 
""
if you were to give all of them a completely free hand  then we
know there will be a lot of wheeling and dealing going on  which you  ' ll
always find in a small circle election of this kind  when people would
not choose you on merit  but by the number of favours you are prepared to
grant them  you won't say may the best man or woman win  but rather may
the richest one win  because we know that this election  is not going
to be subject to our electoral laws  so you can give as much money as you
like  to members of the selection committee  to vote for you 
""
the problem is  if the press should ever find out  that a
particular individual who has succeeded to become a member of the provisional
legislature  had actually bribed the people  so that he or she won 
well there is no criminal sanctions at all  but will make the whole
provisional legislature  the laughing stock in the world 
""
well  we the democratic party tried to introduce a bill  a
private member  ' s bill  to make sure that the election of the chief
executive  would be subject to our normal electoral laws  and we were
defeated 
""
we have not tried again in relation to the election  of the
provisional legislature  because we believe the provisional legislature is
unconstitutional and illegal anyway 
""
the other problem for mr lu ping  is that although he and a lot
of chinese leaders no doubt would like to see as many experienced legislators
win or former legislators win  their wishes may not come true  because
 it merely depends on how many favours a particular candidate is prepared
to give 
""
and there  ' s no certainty either  because the beauty is it will
be by secret ballot  so you would have plenty of promises  with or
without favours  but how many votes can you really count on 
""
ask simon lee  who wanted very much to be nominated as a
candidate for the post of chief executive 
""
he said that no less than one hundred members of the selection
committee had promised to vote for him  and how many votes did he get 
""
forty-three 
""
so mr lu ping  cannot feel certain at all  that the people
he wanted  would necessarily be elected into office  if he were to give
 the four hundred people a completely free hand 
""
but supposing he were to opt for the other alternative  and
decides to direct them how to vote 
""
well  how sure is he that all four hundred people  or most
of them would listen  to him 
""
remember  the beauty is secret ballot 
""
but if it is ever found out in future  that mr lu ping was
responsible for having this provisional legislature constituted because he
had interfered  in the election process  then beijing can no longer
put the blame on hong kong people 
""
that is mr lu ping  ' s dilemma 
""
as for the likely candidates  we already know don't we  that
a number of former appointed legislators who never dared to face any election
either in ninety-one or ninety-five  are now rushing to register
themselves as candidates 
""
then there are a rather large number of candidates who actually
stood in democratic elections in ninety-one and ninety-five but were beaten
 by candidates belonging to the democratic camp 
""
well i recognise a number of faces  of candidates who lost to
me  but if they were to win this time in this election  it would really
give me a lot of face wouldn't it 
""
but what platforms will these candidates have  during this
so-called election 
""
no doubt the hong kong people would like them to run on a platform
of defending the hong kong system  in the one-country-two-systems policy
but that would guarantee failure in the so-called election 
""
i wonder how many of these candidates know  what beijing
expects them to do  namely  to rubber-stamp laws on subversion 
reinstate repressive colonial laws  and to repeal the most important parts
of the bill of rights ordinance  thereby rendering it meaningless 
""
yes beijing wants them to do the dirty work 
""
so  as of christmas this year we are going to have one
territory  two legislatures  one defending our system  and the other
defending china  ' s system 
""
i wish christmas would never come this year
