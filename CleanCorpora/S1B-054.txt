Uh our finance minister whom I respect a great deal 
noise  he has not been able to persuade me to
agree with him 
or we have not even now what to 
""
Now it would as it is 
already  a
few words 
a few words  as to how
a 
""
And when the break up you see you find  that twenty-seven
 go towards the debt
service charges 
""
Now these twenty-seven should be very telling  when you realise
 more than anything
else 
 of
your defence expenditure 
""
Now  his
persuasion in 
""
And since for everytime he comes back  he comes back with a bag
full 
""
And then bagfull ultimately has to be paid 
""
We have created an impression in the country  that it is a day
of jubilation 
""
As it is  even in families when we start
celebrations as such 
""
When more debts are required 
""
When  and things become very difficult
""
""
The learned finance minister would have seen  the latest report
of the U N D T 
""
Now the whole system of international monitory system is so
manipulated 
""
You won't do it  and if you look at the logic of debt trap of
any society 
""
Because devaluation is manipulated 
""
Ever since we have launched on this 
globalisation  constantly
devalued 
""
About  and more times
informally 
""
And today I think if I have mentioned somewhere in my article
recently 
""
Uh I hope 
""
The end result is 
there is not a single country as much 
""
And this is the irony of the whole thing  that the more you pay
the more you owe 
""
And this will go on happening in our case also 
""
We will be happy for a while  but I don't think we can be happy
""
""
Everytime uh 
quote myself  the use
of this policy has been uh 
that we have followed in the past 
""
What was our past  ?
""
Our past was primarily based on self-reliance 
""
Our past was on import substitution 
""
And for number of years  outlook
""
""
It is not as if we are a new country  like any African African
country in dark continents 
""
We are a country who have built in last  uh uhm so many years
after freedon  to come to occupy a very respectable position so far as
industrialisation goes 
""
We are in a mess because of the debt that we took 
""
Who took the debts  ?
""
How debts were taken  ?
""
How debts were squander ?
""
I will not enter into that  who did it
""
""
And I know on what we spent 
""
But the main difficutly is different now 
""
Let me see we make this country believe  as if self-reliance and
 import substitution were dirty words
""
And we must get out of that  and launch launch on the new era
""
""
So therefore you see that increasingly now  we are getting into
 and even the experts have said by the end of the
eighth plan  our our debt
service charges will be approximately thirty-two percent  of the revenue
earnings 
""
Well it is for  whether that
will be a good day for India  or that will be a day for celebration for
India 
""
That is for him to decide
""
I don't know  long enough to
see that day 
""
Because  I come from that generation which participated in
freedom struggle 
""
I also belong 
which took pride 
""
And we still continue to take pride in that 
""
And if those next generation which thinks they are wiser now than
Nehru of course they are welcome to it 
""
I will not question their wisdom 
""
But I will also say at the same time 
needs caution 
""
The new budget that we have seen  the
nations building prospects 
""
The honourable finance Minister can get up and say that well 
this year I have given more money for education than he gave last year 
""
That is no comparison  so it
is slightly better than the worst 
""
The issue basically is  that everything that builds the nation
ultimately 
""
And everything that doesn't build the nation is expanding 
""
So therefore this is the policy that we are following 
""
I if I get timing sir I would have spoken  at length about other
dimensions 
""
My young friend Mr  Minister of State for foreign affairs is
sitting here 
""
I would have discussed the foreign policy also  and I would have
discussed 
""
And I think it is not him  but one or two
points I want to make 
""
And one point basically is about the Kashmir today 
""
I think this is something  is
everything happening there alright 
""
Have we not reached a stage  when I think as a nation not as a
party 
""
As a nation we have to  uh see what we can do
""
""
Look at the entire situation sir 
""
The para military  sector of police which have gone out there
some times cause us anxiety 
""
And the Prime Minister of India does not think it good enough 
to call even a meeting of the All Party  to discuss this Kashmir
situation 
""
Kashmir has been  from one situation to
another 
""
And if there is any area where we should be axious today  I
think something has to be done 
""
A few days ago I have mentioned also  about I O C conference
""
""
Unfortunately yesterday I was out of town so I could not come to
the constituency committee meeting 
""
But what I see from the reporting  I I spoke to the government
of India on that 
""
I think the policy that we are following regarding I O C  needs
to be to be 
""
I think I O C is a platform  into
a 
""
We have several countries in the  Organisation who
are very friendly to us 
""
And I think that is uh  who
are they 
""
Oh I beg your pardon
""
I I beg you pardon
""
I accept that but mean the same thing  a few words
""
""
Uh whether you put organisation first or Islam first  it doesn't
make much difference 
""
It is so typical to us 
""
It comes to the same thing 
""
The  main point that I am trying to say is that in recent time
and I hope my  and help
the country in that 
""
That redoubling of the effort is very much called for 
""
And I think  we
must make these friends feel and rewrite  has
always been very profitable  and will continue to be profitable for each
one of them 
""
Be the Africa be the Asia 
""
 that in every crisis of this
region 
""
I think  got in danger today
""
I don't see so 
""
But definitely they  must see through the
type of propaganda 
""
And I think that is where 
whole

( 2) Manmohan Singh 
""
""
Sir 
who have taken part  on the budget for nineteen
""
""
As I scan through  could
 have educated the mind
""
""
And I thought the best use I can make  of this reply to the
debate 
""
I sincerely believe  which
have been raised in the debate  in
the budget 
""
Before I reply  to the various points that have been raised in
the debate  to draw the attention of this august
house  of the budget as outlined in my
budget speech 
""
I will state six basic objectives 
""
The first one  to bring about a greater sense of fiscal
deficit 
""
Two  by
insistance consolidation of last twenty-two months  has to be used to step
up investments 
programmes and on social services 
""
Three  in
ninety-three ninety-four  in succeeding years
of the 
""
Four  towards a
simpler tax system with moderate rate  on
voluntary 
""
Five  agro
pertaining activities because agriculture after all  is the foundation of
our economic growth 
""
Six  which gives export
 international
endeavour 
""
It is against this background that I would like 
to judge whether the budget meets the challenge  uh of the time or not
""
""
As I mentioned Madam  about
inflation 
""
I heard the concern  with
regards to inflation 
""
But we must also look at the improvement that has come about 
in 
""
Mr Balanandan 
""
I don't want to go into  but I
challenge everybody  that by any yardstick whether if you mention the
average rate of inflation or twice the rate of inflation  whether you
mention  price index for
industrial workers or consumers price index for agricultural workers  or
wholesale price index  in this last year
 very credible improvement on the inflation
front 
""
We are today  with inflation rate
of no more than six point four percent  which is a trend rate of growth
""
""
I am not satisfied 
""
I believe  India must gain hike
""
""
Today the rest of the world  uh do does not tolerate an
inflation rate of more than three to four percent
""
You must therefore have the ambition  to bring our inflation
rate further down  there must be greater fiscal
discipline 
""
We must press ahead with the task of fiscal consolidation  and
this year fiscal deficit will be about four point seven percent of G D P 
""
Next year we must reduce it to four 
""
That is the only way 
""
The experience of last  one year clearly brings out two things
""
""
First of all  we must have
a strong sense of fiscal discipline 
""
Second the supplying side of the economy  well
managed 
""
And last year we clearly saw  one
word 
one word  and petroleum products
inflation rate was brought down 
""
And that brings infact  of keeping
the fiscal system 
""
The Central government has made  in the
last twenty-two months 
""
I  that the State government need to do the same
thing  several public
sector enterprises  state Road
Transport Corporation  which are a next burden
on the exchequer of the state 
""
Several honourable members  referred to a need to increase
investment in agriculture 
""
I hear that concern  but agriculture basically is a state
subject  if state
finances remain in such shambles as they are
""
If we lose roughly six thousand  on
electricity generation in our country  is a minimum
rate of return  of three percent on fixed investment in the power sector
""
But  had
combined rate of return in the country was a negative figure of over
twenty-one percent 
""
Launches of state electricity board  amount to six thousand
 per annum
""
We need power 
""
Without power there can be no meaningful economic development
""
And yet  going to find the sources for
the generation of power  if the power sector is being sore on it
""
And to have  as six thousand
 per annum
""
So I urge members  honourable members that we must evolve a
viable national consensus 
""
