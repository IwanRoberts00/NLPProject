Uh our finance minister whom I respect a great deal 
noise but one thing on which he has not been able to persuade me to
agree with him that we are not ready getting into debt 
or we have not even now what to one word 
Now it would as it is if you look at the budget 
already you see a very interesting figure noises uh a
few words and uh budget came have even graphically 
a few words the break up of the rupee as to how
a rupee come and how a rupee goes 
And when the break up you see you find that twenty-seven
 paisa in a rupee go towards the debt
service charges 
Now these twenty-seven should be very telling when you realise
 that our defence budget which is of course more than anything
else is thirteen paisa in a rupee 
 that is your debt service charges are already more than twice of
your defence expenditure 
Now I must compliment the finance minister because his
persuasion in Washington always gets him more loans 
And since for everytime he comes back he comes back with a bag
full 
And then bagfull ultimately has to be paid 
We have created an impression in the country that it is a day
of jubilation when we get more debts 
As it is one word even in families when we start
celebrations as such 
When more debts are required various things just out 
When the truth comes home and things become very difficult
The learned finance minister would have seen the latest report
of the U N D T which I had a had a time to glance over 
Now the whole system of international monitory system is so
manipulated that the more we give the more we want 
You won't do it and if you look at the logic of debt trap of
any society that is what is happening 
Because devaluation is manipulated 
Ever since we have launched on this tryst with 
globalisation the Indian rupee has been constantly
devalued 
About some times formally many times and more times
informally 
And today I think if I have mentioned somewhere in my article
recently which is gone down by forty-two percent 
Uh I hope I'm saying the right figure 
The end result is that you find that you go on pay 
there is not a single country as much a few words 
And this is the irony of the whole thing that the more you pay
the more you owe 
And this will go on happening in our case also 
We will be happy for a while but I don't think we can be happy
 for a long time 
Everytime uh the new one word policy if I may 
quote myself in the article that I have just written the use
of this policy has been uh reversing many sound economic policies 
that we have followed in the past 
What was our past ?
Our past was primarily based on self-reliance 
Our past was on import substitution 
And for number of years following the Nehruvian outlook
 this society has built itself 
It is not as if we are a new country like any African African
country in dark continents 
We are a country who have built in last uh uhm so many years
after freedon to come to occupy a very respectable position so far as
industrialisation goes so far as our economy goes 
We are in a mess because of the debt that we took 
Who took the debts ?
How debts were taken ?
How debts were squander ?
I will not enter into that area because I know who did it
And I know on what we spent 
But the main difficutly is different now 
Let me see we make this country believe as if self-reliance and
 and import substitution were dirty words
And we must get out of that and launch launch on the new era
 then we go on doing this one word 
So therefore you see that increasingly now we are getting into
 more and more debts and even the experts have said by the end of the
eighth plan if we continue doing what we are doing our our debt
service charges will be approximately thirty-two percent of the revenue
earnings 
Well it is for the learned minister to decide whether that
will be a good day for India or that will be a day for celebration for
India 
That is for him to decide
I don't know I hope I will not live enough long enough to
see that day I don't want to see that day 
Because I come from that generation which participated in
freedom struggle 
I also belong that to that generation 
which took pride in the policies that Nehru followed 
And we still continue to take pride in that 
And if those next generation which thinks they are wiser now than
Nehru of course they are welcome to it 
I will not question their wisdom 
But I will also say at the same time that what we are doing 
needs caution and needs understanding 
The new budget that we have seen is gradually shrinking the
nations building prospects 
The honourable finance Minister can get up and say that well 
this year I have given more money for education than he gave last year 
That is no comparison because last year it was worst so it
is slightly better than the worst that is not the issue 
The issue basically is that everything that builds the nation
ultimately is shrinking 
And everything that doesn't build the nation is expanding 
So therefore this is the policy that we are following 
I if I get timing sir I would have spoken at length about other
dimensions of the of the policies that India is following 
My young friend Mr Minister of State for foreign affairs is
sitting here 
I would have discussed the foreign policy also and I would have
discussed the various things that are causing us anxiety 
And I think it is not him a few words but one or two
points I want to make 
And one point basically is about the Kashmir today 
I think this is something which you must think over is
everything happening there alright 
Have we not reached a stage when I think as a nation not as a
party whether we sit on that side or this side 
As a nation we have to sit up and uh see what we can do
Look at the entire situation sir that police was involved 
The para military sector of police which have gone out there
some times cause us anxiety 
And the Prime Minister of India does not think it good enough 
to call even a meeting of the All Party to discuss this Kashmir
situation 
Kashmir has been one word from one situation to
another 
And if there is any area where we should be axious today I
think something has to be done 
A few days ago I have mentioned also about I O C conference
Unfortunately yesterday I was out of town so I could not come to
the constituency committee meeting 
But what I see from the reporting I I spoke to the government
of India on that 
I think the policy that we are following regarding I O C needs
to be to be redoubled 
I think I O C is a platform which is converting itself into
a into sort of a follow on organisation of what Pakistan says 
We have several countries in the one word Organisation who
are very friendly to us most of them who are they 
And I think that is uh we should definitely who
are they Pardon who are they 
Oh I beg your pardon
I I beg you pardon
I accept that but mean the same thing a few words
 
Uh whether you put organisation first or Islam first it doesn't
make much difference 
It is so typical to us 
It comes to the same thing 
The main point that I am trying to say is that in recent time
and I hope my young friend will kindly help us in that and help
the country in that 
That redoubling of the effort is very much called for 
And I think on a on a bilateral basis particularly we
must make these friends feel and rewrite that friendship in India has
always been very profitable and will continue to be profitable for each
one of them 
Be the Africa be the Asia or be the Arab world 
 India's history has been that in every crisis of this
region India has upheld their cause 
I think it's not that India's got in danger today
I don't see so 
But definitely they their diplomacies must see through the
type of propaganda that we are being subjected to 
And I think that is where our wh 
whole effort has to be concentrated on 
 Already 
 A few words 
 Who are they 
 Who are they 
 Who are they 
 A few words 
 
( 2) Manmohan Singh 
Sir I am very grateful to all the honourable members 
who have taken part in this debate on the budget for nineteen
 ninety-three ninety-four 
As I scan through the record of the debate I could
 defer a couple of issues which have educated the mind
 of the members 
And I thought the best use I can make of this reply to the
debate is to clarify some of those issues 
I sincerely believe that many of these issues which
have been raised in the debate they are taken care of adequately in
the budget that I presented in one word 
Before I reply to the various points that have been raised in
the debate I would like madam to draw the attention of this august
house to the basic objectives of the budget as outlined in my
budget speech 
I will state six basic objectives 
The first one to bring about a greater sense of fiscal
deficit and to that extent and fiscal deficit has to be reduced 
Two the rooms for many facilities made possible by
insistance consolidation of last twenty-two months has to be used to step
up investments and expenditure particularly on anti-poverty 
programmes and on social services 
Three we should plan for a strong industrial recovery in
ninety-three ninety-four leading to a great boom in succeeding years
of the Eighth Five year plan 
Four we must set the pace with steps to form towards a
simpler tax system with moderate rate and greater purpose on
voluntary complaint 
Five full force must be given to agriculture agro
pertaining activities because agriculture after all is the foundation of
our economic growth 
Six we must devise a policy in one which gives export
 the highest possible emphasis making it truly international
endeavour 
It is against this background that I would like this house 
to judge whether the budget meets the challenge uh of the time or not
As I mentioned Madam there has been concern about
inflation 
I heard the concern of the members of this house with
regards to inflation 
But we must also look at the improvement that has come about 
in the inflation situation 
Mr Balanandan referred to various statistics 
I don't want to go into various statistical squibble but I
challenge everybody that by any yardstick whether if you mention the
average rate of inflation or twice the rate of inflation whether you
mention the whether you take the consumers' price index for
industrial workers or consumers price index for agricultural workers or
wholesale price index on every considerable index in this last year
 there has been a distinct very credible improvement on the inflation
front 
We are today on a point to point basis with inflation rate
of no more than six point four percent which is a trend rate of growth
 if you look at the past forty years of Indian economy 
I am not satisfied with this performance 
I believe in the next two years India must gain hike
Today the rest of the world uh do does not tolerate an
inflation rate of more than three to four percent
You must therefore have the ambition to bring our inflation
rate further down and that means there must be greater fiscal
discipline 
We must press ahead with the task of fiscal consolidation and
this year fiscal deficit will be about four point seven percent of G D P 
Next year we must reduce it to four or even below 
That is the only way we can bring down inflation 
The experience of last one year clearly brings out two things
First of all if you want to control inflation we must have
a strong sense of fiscal discipline 
Second the supplying side of the economy must be well
managed 
And last year we clearly saw despite administering one
word and prices of fertilisers despite increasing in prices of 
one word commodities and steel and coal and petroleum products
inflation rate was brought down 
And that brings infact to the supreme necessity of keeping
the fiscal system in good shape 
The Central government has made the sincere effort in the
last twenty-two months to bring the fiscal house in order 
I I urge that the State government need to do the same
thing because there are today in the state sector several public
sector enterprises particularly state Electricity Board state Road
Transport Corporation Irrigation Department which are a next burden
on the exchequer of the state 
Several honourable members referred to a need to increase
investment in agriculture 
I hear that concern but agriculture basically is a state
subject and you cannot increase investment in agriculture if state
finances remain in such shambles as they are
If we lose roughly six thousand crores on
electricity generation in our country the national goal is a minimum
rate of return of three percent on fixed investment in the power sector
But as again three percent goes last year we had
combined rate of return in the country was a negative figure of over
twenty-one percent 
Launches of state electricity board amount to six thousand
 crores per annum
We need power 
Without power there can be no meaningful economic development
And yet how is this country going to find the sources for
the generation of power if the power sector is being sore on it
And to have year after year losses as high as six thousand
 crores per annum
So I urge members honourable members that we must evolve a
viable national consensus for sound fiscal management of our economy
