<I>
If you want me to talk on uh Yakshagana
 
I can only talk on things that I have concerned myself with 
 Yakshagana is an art form 
I have been very much interested in popular folk art as
well as the theatrical art of Karnataka 
That means the commercial theatre with their 
music-cum-prose scenery and spectacular elements on the stage 
As a student as a youth we had so many of the theatrical
companies 
I was exposed to them 
I had a fancy for these things 
Later on I had impressions of the Maharashtra theatre
 its music its social place and all that 
Here one particular element interested me is this 
you speak prose you get angry and then you sing a song 
The same substance is carried the same object is carried
through two different mediums 
In dance you do foot work you sing you gesturise 
and so many things 
This put me into the problem 
What can each do ?
What can prose do ?
What can music do ?
What can dance do ?
And what can they not do ?
Therefore for a quite a number of years I experimented in
pure prose plays pure mime plays pure musicals pure folk
musicals and so on 
With this element I began to tackle the Yakshagana
theatre as such 
For I felt it was very very rich in music 
In the sense the words that they speak out in music is
so rich and totally relevated relevant 
to the subject matter 
What does not appeal to me is the cleverness of the display of a
 raga or a tala or any technical element 
Just as grammar is not literature so technique is not art
Technique is meant for a purpose 
You use it for giving it a shape to your emotions 
Here what are the emotions in Yakshgana ?
What are the topics ?
When it comes to the question of tapic topic 
 you know we are taking Mahabharata plays
We are not concerned with Karna or Kaurava or or any
 rakshasa any saint 
We are common people our experience for 
So naturally you have to imagine these characters from how do
they think 
So how do you dress them ?
Do you bring them in your modern day suit or something else ?
In that way Yakshagana had one of the very
richest element from nineteen thirty onwards 
And many European scholars come and see the costume and make up
 of Yakshagana 
It was so interesting 
Even in those days there were old people who could give
 show any rakshasa chara 
 character in a different type and valourous
character in a different type and common people in common dress 
This was the element that attracted them that attracted me too
 on the stage 
But at the same time I felt so many things jarring 
There are the female characters 
Say in a play Satyabhama and Rukmini come or
 Panchvati play the Seeta comes 
Seeta comes in an ordinary dress along with Rama coming in a
different old time costume 
This disharmony again disturbed me 
It is not only that there were so many other questions raised
We have got musical instruments 
There is the drum there is the Bhagwat and there is the
dance 
Bhagwat is there narrating the story in so many ragas
 and beautifully written songs 
But sitting down on the stage can you make sense out 
of even one word that he sings 
He shouts he screeches and to outwit him there is the
Himmela 
The Himmela in most of our dancers are Mummela they dictate
terms to a dancer they do not follow him 
So naturally what happens is you don't even hear a single word
of the Bhagwat 
You hea hear him screeching 
and you hear the drum play and all these things 
This irrelevence with enough material of our own enough
 ragas enough instruments enough judgement what is wrong
with us ?
We have begun to admire technique cleverness for its sake 
shrieking for its sake the drum beating for its sake not for
application of these things to give one word I want
You want me to talk why ?
To show that I am clever in talking that I can use bombastic words
 or to show that I have something to say about the proposed subject
Yakshagana 
That means reference of the content the form is every thing in
art 
By itself things may be beautiful but you are using certain
things to project to communicate a story of the Mahabharata
 and all these things 
Naturally when we take these things when you come on the stage
with uh a monstrous character a Ravana and other characters and
if you bring in Seeta in ordinary dress I should feel that he has stolen the
 girl from the audience there and she doesn't form ?
Similarly in costume 
In old costume they strict some great man created the
rakshasa costumes and these so many beautiful things in terms of colour
In terms of painting some clever fellow did it 
There is a harmony between what colours they have chosen 
It doesn't the belong to the type of uh thinking as in
Kerala the satvik rajsik and tamsik forms
Colour harmony is a different element
Combination of light elements pigment elements and 
on that basis they have done super work so far as many characters
are concerned 
But no costume no ornament for the lady character 
The lady character brings the is brought 
 to be coquettish and woo the audience 
She may be the Seeta in talk and these things you are the
men audiences to be wooed by shiny or very cinema like fans on
the screen so they begin to come with the most beautiful gaudy 
with make-up powder lipsticks and any silk
Now today you have got glaring dresses of any sort you
begin to wear it 
In Kathakali we've got a fine breast plate you
have got a heap of beads on it 
Why do you want the breast plate ?
That means you have lost the eye for judging ornaments and
colour harmony in costume itself in dress one word 
Our Yakshagana dresses I have got certain things like this over
 a grey or red jacket one is complementary to the other in terms
of colour harmony 
Then you put garlands you put beads and glass tubes
and then if somebody presents a a jasmine you put that also more
the merrier 
Absolutely there is no sense of the stage colour harmony
A stage is a painting where characters have to stand in
respective places 
Each man has to balance somebody else forward backward in
terms of colour in terms of form in terms of emotion 
Suppose you have got the Pandavas sculptured out by a a
great Chola artist how would he make them stand one another not
figures like this not presenting the characters in a form that all
the forms blend together 
An artist like Rodan in building the hell Gates of Paradise 
brings in a hundred forms one is harmonious to the other
So the stage has to be conceived in terms of people who is
there
I drive away the musician there 
I don't want the musicians behind to distort the shape of
the beautiful characters 
They may be very important but their music could be heard 
So these are the elements form and content in terms of music
and these things 
One big thing came to me is you take the raga 
and the tala elements your beat you are very perfect you are
great artist in training you never go wrong 
But do you sing the same thing ?
I remember one day a play like a a gypsy comes and
asks Seeta did you see Ravana ?
No I have not seen him I might have seen his leg 
Alright draw a picture of the leg 
Then she completes and makes it a Ravana and Rama comes he
says you are still unfaithful you are still dreaming of Ravana 
Then the punishment 
Summary is Laxman take her and chop her head off 
She is taken most pathetic situation the drum beating Chandi is
as if you are taking a number of sheep to the Kali temple 
This is what happens in every thing 
In every classical form you see thai thak thai thai thak
thai thai thak thai and the song is shringara 
Is it shringara ?
It is terrific shringara then 
This is what made me think how to sing ?
How to dance ?
This is the step work maybe same tala 
She is in a sorrow position wailing all through how does
she present herself 
We confine tala rhythm to the leg 
Emotion is a body element there is the child that can get
angry joyful every element of the body is seen 
Leg and tala is not confined to the legs alone
 to every moment of the rhythm 
The whole body has to respond to an emotion 
So in a greater sense you mean to say what is more effective on
the stage in terms of voice in terms of so many things 
Is there no individuality ?
Have you to repeat it ?
Then there are so many things on the stage which we think of
 where emotions are strife 
All Yakshagana plays are epical plays Mahabharata
 plays or conflicts of emotion 
They can give you a full range of things on the stage if you
want to do it if you want to feel it 
But how would you do it ?
Our guru taught us like this to hold the hands
and go like that 
The guru seems to be a ghost for chasing
people and artists to the length of her entire transformation of
souls 
You are there to feel as an actor evoke what best is there
What best do you give ?
Now I take it a question that is posed to Yakshagana
 and our music also 
Our music is in Yakshagana
 may be classical music 
Why do you sing ?
Does it contain words ?
For what was it created ?
What are the words ?
The words say something your tala says
something your raga says that you are very clever you
can sing for half an hour or even one hour a raga 
But what is the word that you say ?
This is everything I can uh there is a Hindustani song
 who is as great as Rama 
The word is aiso koudara jagamai in
the whole world 
There is none to beat Rama 
Why ?
Because whatever greatness blessing they wanted to know these
people for years together prayed Rama 
Without praising anything doing anything he blessed the 
Vaccha Jatayu he blessed the Kubja 
So there is none like Rama 
If I say the word aiso koudar jagamaai in the
whole world koudar it's acclamation in sound
 jagamaai 
Why ?
 Vinuseva jodravaidinapara vinuseva jodravaidinapara
Ramasarisakonahi koudar 
Every good composition was a reflection of a thought from a saint
or somebody else 
Similarly Yakshagana songs or every song is a reflection
of an emotion 
How do you mouth it ?
Yakshagana is very heroic 
I thump the beat and I show that I am very rigorous 
Are you heroic even in death even in pathos ?
Means even if before your child dies there 
It should make sense 
In which case Yakshagana is an element 
I think to me it is greater than classical element 
For this one thing classical music was written by Savants
 who were mostly saints mostly saints 
They were reclusers 
They were sorry for the birth of man
They were sorry for any anything everything
 
So they used to either sing the praise of the Lord or say O
Lord why did you bring me to earth 
But a drama contains ever so many other emotions joy valour
jealousy and all these things
It must lend them 
It is there 
I can I end end end my short talk
by giving one note of the Yakshagana song 
In the battle after the third battle third day Duryodhana
begins to weep 
We have lost all rounds O Dronacharya where is the hope
for us 
There is no hope 
Because the great demon killer Krishana is 
Arjuna's charioteer 
The man whom I had trusted Vidura has given away and gone away
The great commander my grandfather Bheeshma is lying on a bed
of arrows 
What shall I do ?
Now I will give you the Kannada word yena madali nanu
 ?
What shall I do ?
For what purpose ?
To defeat the Pandavas Pandavara solipade 
Why ?
 Danava takanavanu avage sarathiya agianu 
The great demon killer Krishna is a charioteer for Arjuna
Then my friend Vidura broke his bow went away
Then Bheeshma is lying there almost dead 
What shall I do ?
This mood for an actor can come in ten different ways 
It depends upon his liking of somebody else his hatred or
jealous his despondency his sorrow for this sake Yena
madali nanu pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade
Yena madali nanu pandavara solipade Danavantak-navage sarathiya
agianu 
Ten different moods can be depicted
Do you beat your drum to suit the mood or anything 
So we can build up a great art even today we have got enough
material from the past
Why our tradition to be preserved is though we have not
used it sensibly
We have enough materials 
In music we have a thousand ragas 
How many emotions have I given expression to 
Sometimes we are perverse we are praying Vinayak
In what manner ?
 Vatapi Ganapatim bhajihum va 
You are clapping Ganapati it is a praise 
This perversion why does it happen ?
You are a votary of grammar thinking grammar is art 
Grammar is that art 
It is this way we can do a lot and a lot can be done to
preserve or show the greatness of our own art 
Showing by our skill about art is totally different 
You can admire me you can admire anybody 
But show the potentiality of the Indian art how it relates to
the expression of the human urge in ways of art I think I have bored you
enough
