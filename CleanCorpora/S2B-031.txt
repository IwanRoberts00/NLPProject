""
If you want me to talk on uh  Yakshagana
""
""
I can only talk on things that I have concerned myself with 
""
""
""
I have been very much interested in popular  as
well as the theatrical art of Karnataka 
""
That means the commercial theatre 
music-cum-prose 
""
As a student  we had so many of the theatrical
companies 
""
I was exposed to them 
""
I had a fancy for these things 
""
Later on  impressions of the Maharashtra theatre
""
""
Here 
you speak prose 
""
The same substance is carried  the same object is carried
through two different mediums 
""
In dance 
and so many things 
""
This put me into the 
""
What can each do  ?
""
What can prose do ?
""
What can music do ?
""
What can dance do ?
""
And what can they not do  ?
""
Therefore for a quite a number of years  in
pure prose plays  pure folk
musicals 
""
With this element  the Yakshagana
theatre as such 
""
For I felt 
""
In the sense  is
so rich 
to the subject matter 
""
What does not appeal to me is the cleverness of the display of a
""
""
Just as grammar is not literature  is not art
""
""
Technique is meant for a purpose 
""
You use it for 
""
Here what are the emotions in  ?
""
What are the topics  ?
""
When it comes to the question of 
 you know we are taking Mahabharata plays
""
We are not concerned with  or any
""
""
We are common people our experience for 
""
So naturally you have to imagine these characters  from how do
they think 
""
So how do you dress them ?
""
Do you bring them in your modern day suit or something else  ?
""
In that way  had one of the very
richest element from nineteen thirty onwards 
""
And many European scholars come and see  the costume and make up
""
""
It was so interesting 
""
Even in those days  give
""
 and valourous
character in a different type and common people in common dress 
""
This was the element that attracted them  that attracted me too
""
""
But at the same time 
""
There are the female characters 
""
Say in a play  and Rukmini come or
""
""
Seeta comes in an ordinary dress  along with Rama coming in a
different 
""
This disharmony again 
""
It is not only that  there were so many other questions raised
""
We have got musical instruments 
""
There is the drum  and there is the
dance 
""
Bhagwat is there narrating the story in so many  ragas
""
""
But sitting down on the stage 
of even one word that he sings 
""
He shouts  and to outwit him there is the
Himmela 
""
The Himmela in most of our dancers  they dictate
terms to a dancer 
""
So naturally what happens is  you don't even hear a single word
of the Bhagwat 
""
You 
and you hear the drum play and all these things 
""
This irrelevence  enough
 what is wrong
with us  ?
""
We have begun to admire technique 
shrieking for its sake  not for
application of these things to give  I want
""
You want me to talk  ?
""
To show that I am clever in talking that I can use bombastic words
 to show that I have something to say about the proposed subject
Yakshagana 
""
That means  reference of the content the form is every thing in
art 
""
By itself  but you are using certain
things to project  Mahabharata
""
""
Naturally when we take these things  when you come on the stage
with uh  and
if you bring in Seeta in ordinary dress I should feel that he has stolen the
 ?
""
Similarly in costume 
""
In old costume  some great man created the
rakshasa costumes and these so many beautiful things  in terms of colour
""
""
In terms of painting 
""
There is a harmony between what colours they have chosen 
""
It doesn't  to the type of uh thinking as in
Kerala the  forms
""
""
Colour harmony is a different element
""
Combination of 
on that basis  work so far as many characters
are concerned 
""
But 
""
The lady character 
""
""
She may be the  in talk and these things you are the
men audiences to be wooed by shiny  fans on
the screen 
with make-up powder  any silk
""
Now today you have got  you
begin to wear it 
""
In Kathakali  you
have got a heap of beads on it 
""
Why do you want the breast plate  ?
""
That means  you have lost the eye for judging ornaments and
colour harmony in costume itself 
""
Our Yakshagana dresses I have got certain things like this  over
 one is complementary to the other in terms
of colour harmony 
""
Then you put  and glass tubes
and then if somebody presents a  more
the merrier 
""
Absolutely there is no sense of the stage  colour harmony
""
A stage is a  where characters have to stand in
respective places 
""
Each man has to balance somebody else  backward in
terms of colour 
""
Suppose you have got the Pandavas  a
great Chola artist  not
figures like this  in a form that all
the forms 
""
An artist like Rodan in building the hell 
brings in a hundred forms  one is harmonious to the other
""
So  in terms of people who is
there
""
I drive away the musician there 
""
I don't want the musicians  the shape of
the beautiful characters 
""
They may be very important but their music could be heard 
""
So these are the elements form and content  in terms of music
and these things 
""
One big thing came to me is 
and the  elements your beat you are very perfect you are
great artist in training 
""
But do you sing the same thing ?
""
I remember one day  a gypsy comes and
asks Seeta  did you see Ravana ?
""
No I have not seen him 
""
Alright draw a picture of the leg 
""
Then she completes and makes it a Ravana  he
says you are still unfaithful you are still dreaming 
""
Then the punishment 
""
Summary 
""
She is taken  most pathetic situation the drum beating Chandi is
as if 
""
This is what happens in every thing 
""
In every classical form you see  thai thak thai thai thak
thai thai thak thai 
""
""
Is it  ?
""
It is terrific 
""
This is what made me think  ?
""
How to dance  ?
""
This is the step work maybe same 
""
She is in a sorrow position  how does
she present herself 
""
We confine 
""
Emotion is a body element  there is the child that can get
angry 
""
Leg and  is not confined to the legs alone
""
""
The whole body has to respond to an emotion 
""
So in a greater sense you mean to say what is more effective on
the stage 
""
Is there no individuality ?
""
Have you to repeat it  ?
""
Then there are so many things  on the stage which we think of
""
""
All Yakshagana plays are epical plays  Mahabharata
""
""
They can give you a full range of things  on the stage if you
want to do it if you want to 
""
But how would you do it  ?
""
Our  taught us like this to hold the hands
and go like that 
""
The  for chasing
people  entire transformation of
souls 
""
You are there to feel as an actor  evoke what best is there
""
""
What best do you give  ?
""
Now I take it  Yakshagana
""
""
Our music  Yakshagana
""
""
Why do you sing  ?
""
Does it contain words  ?
""
For what was it created  ?
""
What are the words  ?
""
The words say something  says
something  says that you are very clever you
can 
""
""
But  ?
""
This is everything  there is a Hindustani song
""
""
The word is  in
the whole world 
""
There is none to beat Rama 
""
Why  ?
""
Because whatever greatness blessing they wanted to know  these
people 
""
Without praising anything doing anything 
Vaccha 
""
So 
""
If I say the word  in the
whole world  acclamation in sound
""
""
Why  ?
""
 Vinuseva jodravaidinapara vinuseva jodravaidinapara
Ramasarisakonahi koudar 
""
Every good composition was a reflection of a thought from a saint
or somebody else 
""
Similarly  is a reflection
of an emotion 
""
How do you mouth it  ?
""
Yakshagana is very heroic 
""
I thump the beat and I show that I am very rigorous 
""
Are you heroic even in death even in pathos ?
""
Means even if before your child dies there 
""
It should make sense 
""
In which case Yakshagana is an element 
""
I think to me it is greater than classical element 
""
For this one thing  Savants
""
""
They were reclusers 
""
They were sorry for the birth of man
""
They were sorry for  everything
""
""
So they used to either sing the praise of the Lord  or say O
Lord 
""
But a drama contains ever so many other emotions  joy valour
jealousy and all these things
""
It must lend them 
""
It is there 
""
I can I  short talk
by giving one note of the Yakshagana song 
""
In the battle after the third battle third day  Duryodhana
begins to weep 
""
We have lost all rounds  where is the hope
for us 
""
There is no hope 
""
Because 
Arjuna's 
""
The man whom I had trusted Vidura has given away and gone away
""
""
The great commander my grandfather Bheeshma is lying  on a bed
of arrows 
""
What shall I do  ?
""
Now I will give you the Kannada word  yena madali nanu
 ?
""
What shall I do  ?
""
For what purpose  ?
""
To defeat the Pandavas 
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
""
The great demon killer  Krishna is a charioteer for Arjuna
""
Then  went away
""
""
Then Bheeshma is lying 
""
What shall I do  ?
""
This mood for an actor can come in ten different ways 
""
It depends  of somebody else his hatred or
jealous  Yena
madali nanu  pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade
""
Yena madali nanu pandavara solipade Danavantak-navage sarathiya
agianu 
""
Ten different moods can be depicted
""
Do you beat your drum to suit the mood 
""
So we can build up a great art even today  we have got enough
material from the past
""
Why our  though we have not
used it sensibly
""
We have enough materials 
""
In music we have a thousand 
""
How many emotions have I given expression to 
""
Sometimes  Vinayak
""
""
In what manner  ?
""
""
""
You are clapping Ganapati it is a praise 
""
This perversion why does it happen  ?
""
You are a votary of grammar 
""
Grammar is that art 
""
It is this way we can do a lot  to
preserve or show the greatness 
""
Showing by our skill about art is totally different 
""
You can admire me you can admire anybody 
""
But show the potentiality of the Indian art  how it relates to
the expression of the human urge  in ways of art I think I have bored you
enough
