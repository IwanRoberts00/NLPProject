""
""
If you want me to talk on uh  Yakshagana
""
""
I can only talk on things that I have concerned myself with 
""
""
""
""
well as the theatrical art of Karnataka 
""
That means the commercial theatre 
""
""
As a student  we had so many of the theatrical
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Here 
""
""
The same substance is carried  the same object is carried
""
""
In dance 
""
""
""
""
What can each do  ?
""
""
""
""
""
What can dance do ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
theatre as such 
""
For I felt 
""
In the sense  is
so rich 
""
""
What does not appeal to me is the cleverness of the display of a
""
""
Just as grammar is not literature  is not art
""
""
""
""
You use it for 
""
""
""
What are the topics  ?
""
When it comes to the question of 
""
""
We are not concerned with  or any
""
""
""
""
""
they think 
""
""
""
""
""
In that way  had one of the very
richest element from nineteen thirty onwards 
""
And many European scholars come and see  the costume and make up
""
""
It was so interesting 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There are the female characters 
""
""
""
""
Seeta comes in an ordinary dress  along with Rama coming in a
""
""
This disharmony again 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But sitting down on the stage 
""
""
""
""
""
The Himmela in most of our dancers  they dictate
""
""
""
""
""
You 
""
""
""
 what is wrong
""
""
We have begun to admire technique 
""
application of these things to give  I want
""
You want me to talk  ?
""
To show that I am clever in talking that I can use bombastic words
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Naturally when we take these things  when you come on the stage
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are concerned 
""
But 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Our Yakshagana dresses I have got certain things like this  over
 one is complementary to the other in terms
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A stage is a  where characters have to stand in
""
""
Each man has to balance somebody else  backward in
""
""
""
""
figures like this  in a form that all
""
""
An artist like Rodan in building the hell 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I don't want the musicians  the shape of
the beautiful characters 
""
They may be very important but their music could be heard 
""
""
""
""
""
and the  elements your beat you are very perfect you are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No I have not seen him 
""
Alright draw a picture of the leg 
""
Then she completes and makes it a Ravana  he
says you are still unfaithful you are still dreaming 
""
""
""
""
""
""
as if 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Is it  ?
""
""
""
""
""
How to dance  ?
""
This is the step work maybe same 
""
She is in a sorrow position  how does
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Leg and  is not confined to the legs alone
""
""
The whole body has to respond to an emotion 
""
So in a greater sense you mean to say what is more effective on
""
""
Is there no individuality ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
want to do it if you want to 
""
But how would you do it  ?
""
""
and go like that 
""
""
""
souls 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now I take it  Yakshagana
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
can 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the whole world 
""
There is none to beat Rama 
""
Why  ?
""
""
people 
""
""
Vaccha 
""
""
""
If I say the word  in the
""
""
""
Why  ?
""
 Vinuseva jodravaidinapara vinuseva jodravaidinapara
""
""
""
or somebody else 
""
Similarly  is a reflection
of an emotion 
""
How do you mouth it  ?
""
Yakshagana is very heroic 
""
I thump the beat and I show that I am very rigorous 
""
Are you heroic even in death even in pathos ?
""
""
""
It should make sense 
""
In which case Yakshagana is an element 
""
I think to me it is greater than classical element 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So they used to either sing the praise of the Lord  or say O
""
""
""
jealousy and all these things
""
It must lend them 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
begins to weep 
""
""
for us 
""
There is no hope 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of arrows 
""
""
""
Now I will give you the Kannada word  yena madali nanu
""
""
What shall I do  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This mood for an actor can come in ten different ways 
""
""
jealous  Yena
madali nanu  pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why our  though we have not
""
""
We have enough materials 
""
""
""
How many emotions have I given expression to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You are clapping Ganapati it is a praise 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is this way we can do a lot  to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
enough
