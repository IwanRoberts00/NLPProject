So today we  who
""
""
Mahatma Gandhi the  was
""
masses  but also boldly let the struggle for freedom
""
""
And we know that  for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So he 
""
""
""
""
""
chapter of this 
""
In this extract we see the firm faith of Mahatma Gandhi  in
""
""
To realise them 
""
""
The style is simple and direct  and sets the readers thinking
""
""
It is not without a range that I have to take leave of the reader
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay
""
Don't answer chorus  last
""
""
""
""
""
""
So he says that it causes great  pain to him that he is
taking leave of the 
""
""
whether 
""
""
narrative 
""
""
experiment 
""
""
""
""
""
He has attached great ipmortance to his experiments with 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So that every one who reads the book  will understand what he is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
To speak out the truth  and
""
""
Come on yes  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
""
""
""
""
And he says  reproducing truth as he
""
""
""
""
""
He says it has given him inaffable mental peace because he has
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it has  cherished
""
""
""
""
""
After reading the book  everything which is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it might bring the waverers uh to that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Those who were doubtful about  ahimsa
""
""
My uniform experience convinces me that there is no other god 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if every page of this chapter  does not proclaim to the
""
""
""
""
""
is only one god and that is 
""
""
""
""
""
And another thing he says that  in every chapter of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
His experiment  with truth
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uniform experience convinced him that
""
""
""
""
""
And how uh  that the only means to realise
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And even though  my efforts in this belief may prove fruitless
""
the vehicle and not the great principle is at 
""
""
himself very clear  that even after reading the chapters of the book if
""
""
""
""
his writing and that is why people have the doubt about  ahimsa
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ahimsa 
inadequate
""
And why he says may be he is wrong  ?
""
Why does he say that may be he is not  exactly correct in
explaining  ahimsa
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
full of 
""
""
""
So he said he has tried his 
""
""
The fleeting glimpses therefore  been able
to have of truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of
""
""
""
""
glimpses that is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
truth 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In fact what I have caught is only the plain faintest glimmer
""
""
""
 faintest
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
with assurance as a result of all my experiment  that a perfect vision of
""
""
""
So one more thing he says is  that if you want to realise truth
""
have to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay
""
""
""
""
truth 
""
""
""
""
""
So how can you have a complete vision or perfect vision of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Only if you realise  you can have the
""
""
""
he has described  ?
""
How has Gandhiji described truth ?
""
Yes Ketan  ?
""
""
Like an 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is very powerful
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay  the radiance of truth is million times more than that of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if 
ahimsa  which is found
""
""
""
""
""
all living 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of any field of 
""
""
""
""
""
So a man who is a seeker of  has to be attached
to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So he says  that his devotion to truth he was a seeker of truth
always in life 
""
""
""
""
""
that is why he entered 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Correct
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All creation of 
""
""
""
""
""
You have to identify yourself amongst all creations of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Without self-purification the observance of the law of 
ahimsa 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Your 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
cannot realise 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Self-purification therefore must mean  purification in all
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And purification being highly infectious  of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
surroundings
""
""
Of 
""
""
""
""
""
Whereever he is in any walk of life 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
To attain perfect purity  one has to become absolutely
""
currents 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
