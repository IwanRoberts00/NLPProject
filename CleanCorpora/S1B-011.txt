So today we do a lesson about Mahatma Gandhi who
was a humanitarian okay 
Mahatma Gandhi the Father of the Nation was
the first great leader who not only fired the consciousness of the
masses for independence but also boldly let the struggle for freedom
against the British in India 
And we know that Mahatma Gandhi's weapon for
freedom was ahimsa 
 Ahimsa 
Okay 
He provided a moral foundation to Indian politics and laid great
stress on the spirit of fearlessness 
His autobiography The story of my experiment with
truth is a classic of our time 
So he book he wrote many books 
One of them was The story of my experiment with truth
 
And the chapter which we are doing today is from the last
chapter of this autobiography of his 
In this extract we see the firm faith of Mahatma Gandhi in
truth and ahimsa 
To realise them one must have self-purification in mind 
word and deed 
The style is simple and direct and sets the readers thinking
 noise 
It is not without a range that I have to take leave of the reader
And why does he say he has to take leave of the reader ?
Because it is the last chapter
Okay
Don't answer chorus because it is the last last
chapter of his autobiography okay
 Last 
So he says that it causes great pain to him that he is
taking leave of the reader 
I had set a high value on my experiment and I do not know
whether I've been able to do justice to them 
I can only say that I have spared no pains to give a faithful
narrative 
So he says that he has I have set high value to my
experiment he has attached great importance 
 Great importance 
He has attached great ipmortance to his experiments with 
 truth okay
 Truth 
And he is not sure whether he is able to do 
justice to those experiments with truth okay 
 Justice to 
Treat them with fullness and clarity justice 
To treat them with fullness and clarity 
So that every one who reads the book will understand what he is
 writing about 
I can say that I have spared no pains to give a faithful
narrative 
That he's done all that he can do to give 
the account of truth that appeared to him in the right way as it appeared
to him 
To describe truth as it has appeared to me and in the exact manner
in which I have arrived at has been his ceaseless effort 
So what has been a ceaseless effort ?
To speak out the truth and
Come on yes ?
To describe truth as as it has appeared to him and in the
exact manner in which he has arrived at his conclusion
Okay
So his ceaseless effort was to ar to describe
truth as it appeared to him and in which way he arrived at truth
Okay 
This exercise has given me inaffable mental peace because it
has been my fond hope that it might bring faith in truth and 
ahimsa to the waverers 
And he says this exercise of reproducing truth as he
 felt about it as he arrived at truth has given him inaffable
mental peace undescribable mental peace 
And why does he say ?
He says it has given him inaffable mental peace because he has
always cherished he has always hope that those who work against
 ahimsa would follow the path of ahimsa 
once they read the book 
Okay 
So it has it was always his desire his cherished
desire that what was his cherished desire ?
Yes ?
After reading the book uh or a everything which is
 The one who were 
The one who were waverers and they don't know about truth
and ahimsa haan that uh 
it might bring the waverers uh to that
 Haan 
In the principle of ahimsa 
Those who were doubtful about the principle of ahimsa
 will start following it 
My uniform experience convinces me that there is no other god 
than truth 
So he says that there is only one god and that is 
truth 
 Truth 
And he does not vary in that 
Okay he is definite about it that there is only one god and that is
 truth 
 Truth 
And if every page of this chapter does not proclaim to the
reader that the only means for the realisation of truth is ahimsa
 I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters to have
been in vain 
So he says that first of all he is convinced that there
is only one god and that is truth 
 Truth 
And another thing he says that in every chapter of the
book which book please ?
My experiment with truth
His experiment with truth
Okay 
In every chapter of his book he has tried to explain that
if you want to realise truth if you want to reach to the goal of
truth you have to follow the path of ahimsa 
 
 Ahimsa 
Okay 
I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters have been 
in vain
And he says that in every chapter he has tried to explain 
that the only means of realisation of truth is ahimsa
 
 Ahimsa 
And if people do not understand it then his writing
 that book and explaining about the principle of ahimsa
 is all in vain is futile is useless 
 In vain 
Okay 
So what is Gandhiji's uniform experience convince him ?
 Gandhiji's uniform experience convinced him that
there is only one god and that is truth
Okay 
And how uh what does he say that the only means to realise
truth is what ?
 Ahimsa 
 Ahimsa 
The only means to realise truth is ahimsa 
 Ahimsa 
Okay 
And even though my efforts in this belief may prove fruitless
let the leader re readers know that
the vehicle and not the great principle is at fault 
So he says that I he wants to make
himself very clear that even after reading the chapters of the book if
people still have doubt about the great principle of ahimsa
 then they are wrong 
It is he who is writing the book may be he is not very clear in
his writing and that is why people have the doubt about ahimsa
 
So he that is the vehicle he himself who is writing the book
 he himself is wrong somewhere and not the principle of 
 ahimsa 
 Ahimsa 
After all however sincere my strivings after 
ahimsa may have been they have been imperfect and 
inadequate
And why he says may be he is wrong ?
Why does he say that may be he is not exactly correct in
explaining about ahimsa and writing about ahimsa
 ?
Yes ?
Because his principle of ahimsa is very 
uh complex and it can not be described in uh simple words
Yes 
It is very difficult to describe such a great principle as 
 ahimsa 
And he says that whatever he has seen may not be fully the
full of ahimsa 
Everything of ahimsa 
So he said he has tried his level best to describe 
 ahimsa 
The fleeting glimpses therefore that I've been able
to have of truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of
truth a million times more intense than that of the sun we daily see
with our eyes 
And what does he say that he only has fleeting
glimpses that is vanishing views 
Okay
Something which passes off within a minute
Okay 
And he says that it is very difficult to explain 
truth whose radiance is million times more than that of the 
 sun okay 
 Sun 
So the brightness of truth is much more than the
brightness of the sun 
 Sun 
In fact what I have caught is only the plain faintest glimmer
of the mighty efflugence 
And he says that the radiance the lustre of truth is so
 great is so wide that he has only caught the faintest
glimmer 
 Faintest glimmer 
The dim fading light of truth he's got 
And it passes off 
 But this but this much I can say
with assurance as a result of all my experiment that a perfect vision of
truth can only follow a complete realisation of ahimsa 
So one more thing he says is that if you want to realise truth
to the fullest if you want to see truth at its very best then you
have to follow the path of ahimsa 
 Ahimsa 
Know what ahimsa is ?
Okay
Follow the principle of ahimsa 
Only then you can have the full perfect vision of 
truth okay 
 Truth 
So how can you have a complete vision or perfect vision of
truth ?
Yes Pinky ?
We can have perfect vision of truth by realising of 
ahimsa 
Only if you realise ahimsa you can have the
perfect vision of truth
And how what is the power of truth
he has described ?
How has Gandhiji described truth ?
Yes Ketan ?
Like an one word 
Say it in complete 
Power of truth is
 Haan the power of truth 
It is very powerful
It is very powerful
It is uh said that it is ?
Million times more than that of the sun
Million times more than that of the sun 
Okay the radiance of truth is million times more than that of
the sun 
 Sun 
To see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face
to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself
And if Gandhiji says that if you want to practice 
ahimsa practice ahimsa which is found
everywhere the to practice truth which is there uh you
have to practice ahimsa 
If you want to realise truth you have to practice 
ahimsa and the most important thing is you have to love 
all living creatures and the lowlest uh 
 the lowest of creation you should love as you love 
 yourself okay 
 Creatures 
 Yourself 
So to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth
face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself
 So one first of all one has to identify oneself with all
 living creatures and love the lowest of god's creation
And a man who aspires after that and a man who 
speak truth okay who speak truth cannot afford to keep out
of any field of life 
 One word 
So a man who is a seeker of truth has to be attached
to any field of life in which he is involved 
That is why my devotion of truth has drawn me into the field of
politics and I can say without the slightest hesitation and yet in
all humility that those who say that religion has nothing to do with
politics do not know what religion means 
Okay
So he says that his devotion to truth he was a seeker of truth
always in life 
And because he was a seeker of truth he was drawn to the field
of politics 
He wanted to make politics free from violence and
that is why he entered politics 
Okay
So he says politics also should be free from violence because
a seeker of truth he has to follow the path of ahimsa
 ahimsa 
 Ahimsa 
Correct
A seeker of truth has to follow the path of ahimsa
 
 Ahimsa 
And so he says that is why he had enter politics 
 cough 
Identification with eveything that live is impossible 
without self-purification 
And he says first of all he says that you have to
identify yourself with all living creatures 
All creation of god god 
 God 
You have to identify yourself amongst all creations of 
 god 
 God 
And he says if you want to identify yourself with all
creations of god then you have to be self- purified 
 Self-purified 
You have to be self-purified cough 
Without self-purification the observance of the law of 
ahimsa must remain an empty dream 
Okay
And what is this self-purification ?
Yes ?
Self-purification means purification in mind word and deed
Purification of mind word and deed 
Your thought speech and action 
 Word and deed 
 Speech and action 
Okay 
So without self-purification he says you cannot follow the
path of ahimsa 
And if you don't follow the path of ahimsa you
cannot realise truth which is god 
according to Gandhiji 
 Truth 
 God 
 Mahtma Gandhiji 
Okay 
God can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart
So the first important thing of self-purification you have to be
pure at heart good in your deed good in your 
thoughts action 
 Heart 
God can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart 
Self-purification therefore must mean purification in all
walks of life 
 Life 
And this is very important because if you are self- purified
 you are good in thought speech and action 
 Speech and action 
If you are good you can make others good 
okay 
 Others good 
So he says that if you are self-purified you will
naturally see that your surroundings are also purified 
It is also good 
And purification being highly infectious purification of
oneself necessarily leads to the purification of one's 
 surroundings 
 Surroundings 
So what does purification of oneself lead to ?
Come on yes uh you ?
Purification of oneself means purification of the
surroundings
Of one's surroundings 
 Surroundings 
Whereever he is in any walk of life he will see that 
everything else is also purified is good okay 
 Purified 
But the path of self-purification is hard and steep 
To attain perfect purity one has to become absolutely
passion-free in thought speech and action to rise above the opposing
currents of love and hatred attachment and repulsion 
So he says that we are talking on self- purification but
it is not very easy to be self-purified because if you want to be
self-purified you should be absolutely passion-free 
emotion-free in thought speech and action 
 Passion-free 
 Thought speech and action
