So today we  who
was 
""
Mahatma Gandhi the  was
the first  who not only fired the consciousness of the
masses  but also boldly let the struggle for freedom
against the British in India 
""
And we know that  for
freedom was 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
He provided a moral foundation to Indian politics  and laid great
stress 
""
His autobiography  The story of my experiment with
truth 
""
So he 
""
One of them was  truth
""
""
And the chapter which we are doing today is from  the last
chapter of this 
""
In this extract we see the firm faith of Mahatma Gandhi  in
truth and 
""
To realise them 
word and deed 
""
The style is simple and direct  and sets the readers thinking
""
""
It is not without a range that I have to take leave of the reader
""
""
And why does he say he has to take leave of the reader ?
""
""
Because it is the last chapter
""
""
Okay
""
Don't answer chorus  last
chapter  okay
""
""
""
""
""
So he says that it causes great  pain to him that he is
taking leave of the 
""
I had set a high value on my experiment  and I do not know
whether 
""
I can only say that I have spared  no pains to give a faithful
narrative 
""
So he says  I have set high value to my
experiment 
""
""
""
""
""
He has attached great ipmortance to his experiments with 
 okay
""
""
""
""
""
And 
justice to 
""
""
""
""
""
Treat them with 
""
To treat them with fullness and 
""
So that every one who reads the book  will understand what he is
""
""
I can say that I have spared no pains  to give a faithful
narrative 
""
That 
the account of truth that appeared to  him in the right way as it appeared
to him 
""
To describe truth as it has appeared to me and in the exact manner
in which I have arrived at 
""
So what has been a ceaseless effort ?
""
""
To speak out the truth  and
""
""
Come on yes  ?
""
""
To describe truth as  as it has appeared to him and in the
exact manner in which he has arrived at his conclusion
""
""
Okay
""
So his ceaseless effort was  to describe
truth  truth
""
""
Okay 
""
This exercise has given me inaffable mental peace  because it
has been my fond hope 
ahimsa 
""
And he says  reproducing truth as he
 inaffable
mental peace 
""
And why does he say  ?
""
He says it has given him inaffable mental peace because he has
always cherished  that those who work against
""
once they read the 
""
Okay 
""
So it has  cherished
desire  what was his cherished desire ?
""
Yes ?
""
""
After reading the book  everything which is
""
""
""
""
""
""
The one who were waverers  and they don't know about truth
and 
it might bring the waverers uh to that
""
""
""
""
""
In the principle of 
""
Those who were doubtful about  ahimsa
""
""
My uniform experience convinces me that there is no other god 
than truth 
""
So he says 
truth 
""
""
""
""
""
And he does not vary in that 
""
Okay he is definite about it that there is only one god and that is
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if every page of this chapter  does not proclaim to the
reader that the only means for the realisation of truth is  ahimsa
 all my labour in writing these chapters to have
been in 
""
So he says that  that there
is only one god and that is 
""
""
""
""
""
And another thing he says that  in every chapter of the
book  which book please ?
""
""
My experiment with truth
""
""
His experiment  with truth
""
Okay 
""
In every chapter of his book  that
if you want  realise truth if you want to reach to the goal of
truth 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters have been 
in vain
""
And he says 
that the only means of realisation of truth is  ahimsa
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if  then his writing
 ahimsa
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
So what is  ?
""
""
 uniform experience convinced him that
there is only one god and that is truth
""
""
Okay 
""
And how uh  that the only means to realise
truth is what ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The only means to realise truth is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
And even though  my efforts in this belief may prove fruitless
let the  that
the vehicle and not the great principle is at 
""
So he says that  wants to make
himself very clear  that even after reading the chapters of the book if
people still have doubt about the great principle of  ahimsa
""
""
It is he who is writing the book  may be he is not very clear in
his writing and that is why people have the doubt about  ahimsa
""
""
So he that is  the vehicle he himself who is writing the book
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
After all 
ahimsa 
inadequate
""
And why he says may be he is wrong  ?
""
Why does he say that may be he is not  exactly correct in
explaining  ahimsa
 ?
""
Yes ?
""
""
Because his principle of 
uh  and it can not be described in uh simple words
""
""
Yes 
""
It is very difficult to describe 
""
""
And he says that whatever he has seen may not be fully  the
full of 
""
Everything of 
""
So he said he has tried his 
""
""
The fleeting glimpses therefore  been able
to have of truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of
truth  we daily see
with our 
""
And what does he say  fleeting
glimpses that is 
""
Okay
""
Something which passes off  within a minute
""
Okay 
""
And he says that 
truth 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So the brightness of  truth is much more than the
brightness of the 
""
""
""
""
""
In fact what I have caught is only the plain faintest glimmer
of the mighty 
""
And he says  is so
 faintest
glimmer 
""
""
""
""
""
The dim fading light of 
""
And it passes off 
""
 much I can say
with assurance as a result of all my experiment  that a perfect vision of
truth can only follow a complete realisation of 
""
""
So one more thing he says is  that if you want to realise truth
to the fullest  then you
have to 
""
""
""
""
""
Know what  ?
""
Okay
""
Follow the principle of 
""
Only then you can have the full perfect vision of 
truth 
""
""
""
""
""
So how can you have a complete vision or perfect vision of
truth  ?
""
Yes  Pinky ?
""
""
We can have perfect vision of truth by realising of 
ahimsa 
""
""
Only if you realise  you can have the
perfect vision of  truth
""
And  is the power of truth
he has described  ?
""
How has Gandhiji described truth ?
""
Yes Ketan  ?
""
""
Like an 
""
""
Say it in complete 
""
""
Power of truth is
""
""
""
""
""
It is very powerful
""
""
It is  very powerful
""
It is uh  said that it is ?
""
""
Million times more than that of the sun
""
""
Million times more than that of the sun 
""
Okay  the radiance of truth is million times more than that of
the 
""
""
""
""
""
To see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face
to face one must be able to love the  oneself
""
""
And if 
ahimsa  which is found
everywhere  uh you
have to practice 
""
If you want to realise truth 
ahimsa 
all living 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth
face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as  oneself
""
""
 first of all one has to identify oneself with all
 creation
""
""
And a man who aspires after that 
speak  cannot afford to keep out
of any field of 
""
""
""
""
""
So a man who is a seeker of  has to be attached
to 
""
That is why my devotion of truth has drawn me into the field of
politics  without the slightest hesitation and yet in
all humility  that those who say that religion has nothing to do with
politics do not know what 
""
Okay
""
So he says  that his devotion to truth he was a seeker of truth
always in life 
""
And because he was a seeker of truth  he was drawn to the field
of 
""
He wanted to make politics  and
that is why he entered 
""
Okay
""
So he says politics also should be free from  violence because
a seeker of truth  ahimsa
""
""
""
""
""
""
Correct
""
A seeker of truth has to follow the path of  ahimsa
""
""
""
""
""
""
And so he says that is why he had enter 
""
""
Identification with eveything that live 
without 
""
And he says  that you have to
identify yourself with all living creatures 
""
All creation of 
""
""
""
""
""
You have to identify yourself amongst all creations of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And he says if you want to identify yourself with all
creations of god 
""
""
""
""
""
You have to be self-purified 
""
Without self-purification the observance of the law of 
ahimsa 
""
Okay
""
And what is this self-purification  ?
""
Yes  ?
""
""
Self-purification means purification in mind word and deed
""
""
Purification of 
""
Your 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
So without self-purification he says  follow the
path of 
""
And if you don't follow the path of  you
cannot realise 
according to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
God can never be realised by one  heart
""
""
So the first important thing of self-purification you have to be
pure at 
thoughts 
""
""
""
""
""
God can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart 
""
Self-purification therefore must mean  purification in all
walks of 
""
""
""
""
""
And this is very important because if you are self- purified
""
""
""
""
""
""
If you are good you can make 
okay 
""
""
""
""
""
So  he says that if you are self-purified you will
naturally see that your surroundings are also 
""
It is also good 
""
And purification being highly infectious  of
oneself necessarily leads to the purification of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So what does purification of oneself lead to  ?
""
Come on yes uh  you ?
""
""
Purification of oneself means purification of the
surroundings
""
""
Of 
""
""
""
""
""
Whereever he is in any walk of life 
everything else is also 
""
""
""
""
""
But the path of self-purification is hard and steep 
""
To attain perfect purity  one has to become absolutely
passion-free in thought  to rise above the opposing
currents 
""
So he says  but
it is not very easy to be  because if you want to be
self-purified 
emotion-free in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
