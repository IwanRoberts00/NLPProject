<I>
 It's a great privilege for me to be commentating
on the women tennis because uh of the past experience for
nineteen eighty nineteen years lawn tennis 
I was just before the match speaking with uh Nirupama that
on the screen you see Janaki 
And uh Janaki is from Bombay and she is uh Janaki is
from Bombay and she is uh looking fit at the moment 
She has lost uh this is a wrong caption I think we are showing
That about I was pointing out 
Uh this is
This is Nirupama that's Nirupama and she is 
seventeen years now 
So I was just telling you telling the viewers that just before I
entered the uh commentators box I was talking to Nirupama and I was
talking to her father 
In fact we have her father here with us in the commentary box 
And they both were telling me that uh Nirupama was when
she was about fourteen this girl was already uh uh number one in
India
She had won the national uh championship hard court and she has
shown great promise 
But again from the age of fourteen one never found her being picked
up and groomed much earlier and she also suffers from the same
problem
She says now I'm already seventeen and 
it's so late 
And uh why didn't she go into big game and big tennis at
the age of thirteen or fourteen ?
The same answer that lack of finances lack of support and uh
 for women tennis I don't think India is a right place at all 
 We've it's it's continuing for years on end 
I remember the same thing used to happen uptil nineteen
eighty-one until nineteen eighty-two till I played tennis and the
same thing is continuing in ninety-four
Where have we come ten years from now 
 I'd like to uh uh interview her father in fact 
Why don't you come and share your views with us ?
 We'll do that a bit later because we have the first
game in progress 
And that's Nirupama serving the first serve 
applause 
Beautiful crosscourt returned by Janaki 
Love fifteen 
You see Janaki Nirupama serving now to Janaki 
 That's a beautiful forehand down the line returned
 applaud 
And that's love thirty to Nirupama on her service 
Keeping the ball in play Nirupama claiming fifteen thirty 
for the first set 
Next shot there a beautiful return by Janaki cross again
Put away forehand crosscourt volley 
 That's the recaption again 
A very good pick up there by Nirupama makes it 
fifteen forty 
 That's a drop shot there by Janaki 
Nirupama did not even try for this ball I think it is far too long
for her to run 
In uh leading tennis unfortunately service has never played
such a major role 
And there we have first break 
Whereas in men's tennis it acquires much greater
significance probably because the boys follow up their service to the
net and the women even after serving tend to stick it on in the base line
And that makes the service as good as any other ball 
It looses it's significance altogether 
When we have big service in the world like Martina Navratilova and
 Beligin king and they used to follow up their balls to the net
And once they did that it made their service and it made their
ball and made the volley much more effective 
For it one has to stay around at the base line then service really
 does not have that much of significance 
We have the first break of Nirupama and Janaki up one love in
the first set 
We hope that the women's tennis is not such a wash out
as it was in the men's cough 
Love fifteen 
Nirupama has beaten Janaki earlier when they met this year 
that's what she told me 
The ball seems to be much faster on grass for Janaki cough
Janaki serving love thirty 
Oh Janaki is uh relying on this rough shot 
But I don't find Nirupama making any effort to come forward 
This tactics of Janaki is going to pay off untill unless
Nirupama tries to come up to the net 
Beautiful shot there by Janaki a beautiful forehand crosscourt
taking a round of the court 
Equalising the score at thirty all 
First of service 
Forty thirty cough 
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama taking on the offensive for
the first time and hitting that ball crosscourt forehand 
There is that replay a slight backhand return by Janaki and
that the put away crosscourt 
Deuce first first service interruption 
Uh Nirupama trying to make a winner out of it second
return second service however she missed the points she went
in the prickly part where the ball didn't got 
 That's deuce once again first first service 
Return of service good return of service by Nirupama 
cough 
I think that Nirupama really threw away that point she
had a break point from Janaki's service 
 It's not going to be a very easy match for her if she
throws away such easy points 
Good backhand 
Oh Janaki just could not keep up the consistency and
hit the ball double fisted backhand out 
Advantage once again to Nirupama to take a break back into
the first set 
Second service Janaki serving advantage to Nirupama safe
backhand return 
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama who's taken on the
offensive hitting on both the flags very beautifully and has broken
that service of Janaki making it one game all 
And there's the replay of that shot that wonderful
forehand crosscourt winners and no way could Janaki ever reach that ball
One game all first set 
Very good return of service there by Janaki meeting the ball
early and using the timing of the service 
 There's that 
Quick return of service there by Janaki and that's 
the return of Nirupama through down cough 
Yes Janaki slices the ball far too often 
 That's a nice shot there by Janaki making it 
thirty all 
He took she took the ball on the line that's the
replay and you see her totally bent in total position going in for
that tidal line forehand winner 
Oh that was just total bad luck she tried to hit forehand
crosscourt 
I think she needed to bend a little more 
Nirupama serving forty thirty 
Foul out 
 That's deuce once again 
Nirupama needs to get back into the game with more consistency now
Beautiful shot there by Janaki brought the low ball low
ball returned beautifully by Janaki there 
See how low the ball is keeping see and she is able to 
hit that winner 
Uhm good service there by Nirupama stretching around the
backhand corner 
And justifies only low return 
Deuce once again 
Foul first service advantage Janaki 
Third person 
Wonderful top spin backhand return by Janaki forcing 
Nirupama to deuce once again 
Now a drop shot there by Nirupama 
I don't think she really wanted to hit that shot it was 
stroke of luck that fell so short 
In grasscourt say if it is a drop shot it gets uh difficult to
handle it cough 
That game to Nirupama leading two one in the first set 
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor 
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor 
She is coming out with the shots which in the
beginning she wasn't 
She is getting to the winner she's getting the rhythm now
 and is able to reach the ball faster and even the timing of
the ball is much more accurate with her now 
And uh 
Beautiful 
That was a beautiful shot there by Janaki Krishnamurthy
What all can see here is the low rally which they had 
this kind of of best long rally uh in the match here there you can
see the crosscourt backhand return and once again a crosscourt
return by Nirupama and down the line winner 
All are just 
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama 
Beautiful shot out of the blue 
You could see Nirupama doing a little variation in that game 
She started tossing the ball a little higher 
You could see that toss now 
 That's the winner across she sprung out of the blue
Fifteen all 
Oh that's Nirupama's mistake there 
She needs to steady down a little more 
Fifteen thirty uh thirty fifteen 
 That's Janaki a few words which is not
called for at the moment at all 
 That's the beautiful slice uh combat between the two
 girls a shot slight backhand combat with two words it went
on and on until the Janaki gave up 
 That's a break point for Nirupama and a set point
also of the first set 
 That's it the set goes to Nirupama at six two 
 In Hindi 
 In Hindi she played very well 
See what Nirupama was rightly telling me is that uh she
has showed potential much earlier 
But she says that uh nobody did anything for me 
and I had no financer 
In fact I told her you're from Tamil Nadu and Tamil
Nadu does a lot
But she said no I have not got anything from any
support from any quarter 
The women's tennis also needs to be picked up you see
Beautiful but missed shot there by Janaki first 
Thirty love to Nirupama 
Lovely shot again 
Nirupama is really showing a lot of confidence in her strokes 
Just shaping up well playing well and she still has uh 
good future ahead of her 
 In Hindi 
 In HIndi and then uh Nirupama also needs to go
up on the net much more than she has taken her position 
Oh that ball was called out so forty fifteen to Nirupama
Janaki is not showing any signs of coming back 
In the beginning game of the second set 
Oh ho beautiful shot there by Janaki
I think that she's really gone out of the way with
the slight backhand and forehand crosscourt return there 
 That's the replay and that's the crosscourt
shot that Janaki gave up 
 It's beautiful crosscourt winner 
Forty thirty to Nirupama 
Easy return beautiful shot there easy sitter there
sitting there for Nirupama to put on net 
You know there is one thing I wanted to share with you Mahin 
 haan and also for the benefit of our viewers
 that ours uh that see uh replay which we've been
watching then I'll share it with you there is that put away shot
which gives her a game 
You know in our country it's very difficult for women
to come forward at this level 
See for men it's much easier 
Our country it is very traditional and a women has to perform
many roles 
She has to also be a housewife 
She also has to be a daughter at home she also has to do her
studies 
And if they come forward and perform like this in matches 
then they should be encouraged because they have a triple role if they
become a sportswomen 
They have because in India sports alone is not enough they ask
you what else are you ?
What are you in your studies ?
And are you an M B A ?
Or are you a Ph D ?
 It's very important in our country to be a Ph D's
 also 
And plus a woman is never only a Ph D and a sportswoman 
she also has to look after her home she has to have babies 
So therefore you know for a woman life is much more tougher
 and if she comes out of her shell and becomes a sportswoman I think
she needs all the applause and the encouragement which she deserves 
 Haan 
 In Hindi 
But this Nirupama is showing promise but in Hindi
 then the age is over applaud 
Fifteen all Nirupama was saying she's uh 
attending an academy abroad she's training there 
Just imagine the the expense and who is paying for it 
Now if the family is uske peeche 
it's okay otherwise there's nobody 
Her mother is uh with her in the academy 
Uh Nirupama
Nirupama 
I remember for seventeen eighteen years my mother travelled
with me otherwise who is there to be with us 
She travelled all over the country with me 
Beautiful shot there by Janaki 
Janaki can sometimes pull up some beautiful ground strokes
 In Hindi 
She just needs a little more experience 
Over first service 
Uh but she is able to do that well did service and that
one game all in the second set 
But she returns the service is not very effective
