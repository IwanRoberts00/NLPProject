 commentating
on the  of the past experience for
nineteen eighty nineteen years lawn tennis 
""
I was just before the match  Nirupama that
on the screen you see Janaki 
""
And uh  Janaki is
from Bombay and she is uh 
""
She has lost uh  this is a wrong caption I think we are showing
""
""
That about I was pointing out 
""
""
Uh this is
""
""
This is Nirupama 
seventeen years now 
""
So I was just telling you telling the viewers that just before I
entered the uh  and I was
talking to her father 
""
In fact we have her father here with us in the commentary box 
""
And they both were telling me that uh  when
she was about fourteen  uh uh number one in
India
""
She had won the national uh  championship hard court and she has
shown great promise 
""
But again from the age of fourteen one never found her being picked
up  and she also suffers from the same
problem
""
She says 
it's 
""
And uh  big game and big tennis at
the age of  ?
""
The same answer that lack of finances lack of support  and uh
""
""
""
""
I remember the same thing used to happen  uptil nineteen
eighty-one  and the
same thing is continuing in ninety-four
""
Where have we come ten years from now 
""
""
""
Why don't you come and share your views with us  ?
""
 first
game 
""
And 
applause 
""
Beautiful crosscourt returned by Janaki 
""
Love fifteen 
""
You see Janaki Nirupama serving now to 
""
 down the line returned
""
""
And 
""
Keeping the ball in play 
for the first set 
""
Next shot there  by Janaki cross again
""
""
Put away forehand crosscourt volley 
""
""
""
A very good 
fifteen forty 
""
""
""
Nirupama did not even try for this ball I think it is far too long
for her to run 
""
In uh  leading tennis unfortunately service has never played
such a major 
""
And there we have first break 
""
Whereas in  acquires much greater
significance  probably because the boys follow up their service to the
net  and the women even after serving tend to stick it on in the base line
""
""
And that makes the service as good as any other ball 
""
It looses 
""
When we have big service in the world like Martina Navratilova and
 and they used to follow up their balls to the net
""
""
And once they did that  it made their service and it made their
ball and made the volley much more effective 
""
For it one has to stay around at the base line then service really
""
""
We have the first break of Nirupama  and Janaki up one love in
the first set 
""
We hope that the  tennis is not such a wash out
as it was in the 
""
Love fifteen 
""
Nirupama has beaten Janaki earlier when they met this year 
that's 
""
The ball seems to be much faster on grass for Janaki  cough
""
""
Janaki serving love thirty 
""
Oh 
""
But I don't find Nirupama making any effort to come forward 
""
This tactics of Janaki is going to pay off untill  unless
Nirupama tries to come up to the net 
""
Beautiful shot there by Janaki a beautiful forehand crosscourt
taking a round of the court 
""
Equalising the score 
""
First of service 
""
Forty thirty 
""
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama  taking on the offensive for
the first time 
""
There is that replay  a slight backhand return by Janaki and
that the put away 
""
Deuce 
""
Uh  make a winner out of it second
return  went
in the prickly part where the ball didn't got 
""
""
""
Return of service 
cough 
""
I think that  she
had a break point 
""
 match for her if she
throws away such easy points 
""
Good backhand 
""
Oh  and
hit the ball 
""
Advantage once again to Nirupama  into
the first set 
""
Second service Janaki serving  safe
backhand return 
""
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama  taken on the
offensive  and has broken
that 
""
And  that wonderful
forehand crosscourt winners  and no way could Janaki ever reach that ball
""
""
One game all 
""
Very good return of service there by Janaki  meeting the ball
early 
""
""
""
Quick return of service there by Janaki 
the return of Nirupama through down 
""
Yes 
""
""
thirty all 
""
He took she took the ball on the line  the
replay  going in for
that 
""
Oh  total bad luck she tried to hit forehand
crosscourt 
""
I think she needed to bend a little more 
""
Nirupama serving 
""
Foul 
""
""
""
Nirupama needs to get back into the game with more consistency now
""
""
Beautiful shot there by Janaki  low
ball 
""
See how low the ball is keeping 
hit that winner 
""
Uhm  stretching around the
backhand corner 
""
And justifies only low return 
""
Deuce once again 
""
Foul first service 
""
Third person 
""
Wonderful top spin 
Nirupama to deuce once again 
""
Now a drop shot there by Nirupama 
""
I don't think she 
stroke of luck that 
""
In grasscourt say if it is a drop shot it gets uh  difficult to
handle it 
""
That game to Nirupama 
""
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor 
""
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor 
""
""
She is  which in the
beginning she wasn't 
""
She is getting to the winner  getting the rhythm now
 and even the timing of
the ball is much more accurate with her now 
""
""
And uh 
""
""
Beautiful 
""
That was a beautiful shot there by Janaki Krishnamurthy
""
What all can see here is the 
this kind of of  there you can
see the  and once again a crosscourt
return by 
""
""
All are just 
""
""
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama 
""
Beautiful shot 
""
You could see Nirupama doing a little variation in that game 
""
She started tossing the ball a little higher 
""
You could see that toss now 
""
 she sprung out of the blue
""
""
Fifteen all 
""
Oh 
""
She needs to steady down a little more 
""
Fifteen thirty 
""
 not
called for at the moment at all 
""
 slice uh combat between the two
 it went
on and on until the 
""
 and a set point
also 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See what Nirupama was  she
has showed potential much earlier 
""
But she says that uh 
and I had no financer 
""
In fact I told her  Tamil Nadu and Tamil
Nadu does a lot
""
But she said  I have not got anything from any
support from any quarter 
""
The  tennis also needs to be picked up you see
""
""
Beautiful but missed shot there by Janaki 
""
Thirty love to Nirupama 
""
Lovely shot again 
""
Nirupama is really showing a lot of confidence in her strokes 
""
Just shaping up well playing well 
good future ahead of her 
""
""
""
""
""
 go
up on the net much more than she has taken her position 
""
Oh  forty fifteen to Nirupama
""
""
Janaki is not showing any 
""
In the 
""
Oh ho beautiful shot there by Janaki
""
I think that  really gone out of the way with
the slight backhand and forehand crosscourt return there 
""
 the crosscourt
shot that Janaki gave up 
""
""
""
Forty thirty to Nirupama 
""
Easy return  easy sitter there
sitting there for Nirupama to put on net 
""
You know there is one thing I wanted to share with you Mahin 
 and also for the benefit of our viewers
 been
watching then  there is that put away shot
which gives her a game 
""
You know in our country  very difficult for women
to come forward at this level 
""
See for men 
""
Our country it is very traditional  and a women has to perform
many roles 
""
She has to also be a housewife 
""
She also has to be a daughter at home  she also has to do her
studies 
""
And if they come forward and perform like this in matches 
then they should be encouraged  because they have a triple role if they
become a sportswomen 
""
They have  because in India sports alone is not enough they ask
you what else are you  ?
""
What are you in your studies ?
""
And are you an M B A ?
""
Or are you a Ph D  ?
""
 D's
""
""
And plus a woman 
she also has to look after her home 
""
So therefore you know  for a woman life is much more tougher
 I think
she needs all the applause and the encouragement which she deserves 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But this Nirupama is showing promise but  in Hindi
""
""
Fifteen all 
attending an academy 
""
Just imagine the the expense and who is paying for it 
""
Now 
it's 
""
""
Her mother is uh 
""
""
Uh Nirupama
""
""
Nirupama 
""
I remember for  seventeen eighteen years my mother travelled
with me 
""
She travelled all over the country with me 
""
Beautiful shot there by Janaki 
""
Janaki can sometimes pull up some beautiful  ground strokes
""
""
""
""
""
""
She just needs a little more experience 
""
""
Over first service 
""
Uh  well did service and that
one game all in the second set 
""
But she returns the service is not very effective
