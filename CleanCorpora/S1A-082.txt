<I>
Anjani I have always wondered how did you enter the linguistics
 can you tell me something ?
 Sir that's the very interesting question
I started my career as a teacher of English and in post
graduated classes I was uh I started teaching Henry James 
and Browning Ahn 
Henry James because I was working on him then
And Browning because no one in that year was teaching Browning 
 Ahn 
Which year was that ?
That was long time back sixty-eight sixty-nine
Sixty-eight 
And then in under this graduate classes uh something
very interesting happened
The university introduced courses on language 
Ahn 
And there was a professor I won't name who was trained
in C I E F L in the earliest C I E and then in uh Pune 
ah ahn in linguistics 
 Ah ahn 
Ah ahn
But when he was asked to teach that course he refused 
Oh
He said I'm a teacher of literature I won't
do the job of this course 
And now the head of the department of English in Science college
 was a student of London University and had undergone rigorous
training in linguistics during his days but in his whole life he never
got chances to teach linguistics other than that he was teaching
only English and the English courses in classes 
Uhm
I was the youngest person he said 
okay Uhm uh now there is an opportunity for you this is
the syllabus and either you teach in the class or I teach it 
 Laughs 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
And if you agree to teach I will teach you Uhm 
how to teach grammar
 Uhm 
I see 
So I availed those that opportunity
like this yeah
Was it a sort of modern linguistic or it was a 
traditional grammar 
 No no it was grammar in under graduate classes
I see it was 
 It was actually
Traditional grammar in one word 
You know Hornby books and some other books
I know
But Hornby was the main uhm and some books
which C I E F L has just published in linguistics 
 Uhm 
So I said okay I'll do it 
Ahn 
And when in off hours he gave me very good
background for nessasary 
Ah ha 
And of Jesperson particularly Jesperson and in the
library at all college professors and all there so I got interested 
Ahn ha
Then when Professor Verma came to Science college 
 he I was his student his brother was my classmate so he 
persuaded me to join the Central Institute of English Hyderabad 
And there somehow I came in very close contact with Professor
Gokak
 Accha 
 One word he was the Director of that one word
 Institute in sixty-five
Uhn
And that also was interesting in a different way 
In Patna university we had a book paper on practical views
 where we were not getting the name of the author or the period
when there is something was written 
And we would argue with in the classroom
 as to which period it could belong 
Who possibly could be the author just observe it for the style
of writing 
And Professor Gokak started during that class of kind of thing
in this class there
Yeah 
In Hyderabad 
So I could do very well
Uhm 
 That's what brought me close to it 
But I was never very close to Oldfeild who was teaching
grammar
Somehow I didn't like him
Uhn 
I didn't like his assistant uh who was an 
American but I got along well with Yadurajan and Nambiar
Uhn 
And my pronounciation was very much influenced by the
 Bihari atmosphere although in high school I was the
product of an English medium school 
Our teachers were mostly but Nambiar you know helped
me in speaking nice English and all his lessons particularly with
reference to long stresses we used to talk a lot 
Anyway then I went to south there was one
The other was Masica
Uhn for the 
 We became very friendly for non- academic
reasons
We just became very friendly 
And then I wrote a paper that paper you know uh which
was written in the train 
 Uh 
I see 
You know I was uh called very urgently I had to go from
 Hyderabad to Calcutta then to Patna and back 
And the day I was back was the day when we were supposed to 
submit the term paper 
So I had no time 
Touch and go I think
In the train
 One word and in the train and uh he was his
best because of conditional causes exactly and all that 
And then I got scholarship to go to Chicago I would say 
Masica was some what influential he introduced my name there 
Uh I was one word to go there and then one word 
these people something happened and uh that was political 
Uhm 
So I was my name was chucked out and then I went for
 under this Chicago scholarship 
And there I uh in the beginning I was very one word 
without one word 
I did not like phonetics
Uhn 
You know Bansal was not there when I was there I I didn't
like it 
And uh once or twice guide told me if you want to sit 
in to literature he had no objection 
I said no I'll study phonetics 
So that's how I came in but the main point I would say
 was that it had been a very boring experience to remain a
teacher of English
Yes 
And I've no one word of boring in the sense
that you are in destined to teach the same author because
nobody else is ready to change his subject
You are right 
So you go on teaching the same
Year after year
Go on repeating the same thing year after the year 
Whereas in this discipline whatever I learnt in Chicago this is
the best job
Uhm 
But what I teach in the classroom like what I'm 
 I was going to teach is very difficult
Is very difficult 
What what I acquired there
Yeah 
So it's a process of one word and patience
which goes on time
What about you ?
No when we went to Chicago I one word interesting
 when we went to Chicago those were really the hot years 
Yes 
I think we were
Yes
And that debate between uh generative semanticists and
 that's it what Chomsky was trying to say 
 That's it 
Yes
Although it all started with Chomsky himself
I mean it all came out of respect in a sense 
 Other that's right that's 
right
And they were also M I C at that time a few words
 college uh a few words uh George Lakoff
 That's right 
And uh it now seems that the issues were not really
substantial I mean the 
 The issues were very substantial
I see 
The issues were very substantial in the sense that generative
semanticists were the ones who took these basic thought 
assupmtions and conclusions of this standard theory very seriously 
Uh ha 
And in that process they ran into trouble 
You you know one of the basic assumption was that all the
meaning is there in the basic deep tructure
Uhm 
You know you you remember the earlier argument as to
why one or two words is better than the deep structure in that 
manner is that it's not part of what you hear but one can
analyse what is here is the basic thing that's the deep structure
So if all the meaning is there in the deep structure 
Then you have to think about uh ways in
which sentences develop from deep structure 
Yeah
Which made the process very complex 
Generative semanticists didn't find it 
They made it as complex as was necessary to maintain this
assumption
Uhm 
Chomsky on the other hand did not do that when he
realized that it was has become very complex 
he withdrew himself 
Yeah 
And he said well one word structures one word
 let's play a role as semanticists 
And he
And that was it he uh conflict in the hope so
actually it was a better theory people had then trivial views of one
word 
You know for including one word 
But still he he maintains the point to the extent that
 one word 
But as I was a part of this thing I can see that the issues were
really very very serious issues according to us 
But uh certain things disappeared with the one
word 
It it disappeared uh with what has suffered two words
 not exactly the semanticists to uh uh founder of Chomsky
Uhm 
Uh you see if you make something very powerful
Uhm 
And he becomes so powerful that you can't control it 
there is no
It is not possible I know 
No that is it 
Then it is no longer your methodology 
Uhn 
Do you remember the story of this fossil
Yeah 
So the methodology with the generative semanticists developed
Uhn 
Which is so complex and so powerful that it could explain
anything but in a very very complex manner 
And there may be point two words George Lakeoff
withdrew things like one word that I wish one word had
constructed
Yes 
And things like global concect 
 Global 
Anything could be explained in terms of global concect 
And he also introduced what he called you know what is
technically is called one word 
Uhm 
You know like it is uh say uh po point uh
three two seven 
Uhn
Percent uh now
Yes 
That type of calculation
Pure mathematical conclusion 
And that turned majority of practitioners
Yes
 Two words 
It is true that uh you know the the financial crunch which you
mention the other day
Uhm 
That plays a very trivial role because there were other
people who had Chicago like uh have always have big problems
that is including one word themselves
No the point is how can two words trying to make is
that that cohesive group was not there 
And there was no attempted attempt 
forming of
No no there was
Society like group 
No no there was a cohesive group
Uhm 
I think that uh also a kind of a few words 
No no it seems to me 
There was a cohesive group though not located in Chicago
throughout the year 
The other one word 
 Chicago was Chicago was the centre
 all the participants used to spend there lot of their income on
 two words 
I see okay
And free you know free publication articles were uh
available as soon as they were titled
Yeah 
And in some cases you know like sometimes one word 
like writes the script time thing 
Uhn
And he just get it xeroxed two words it could be 
one word 
And then there would be you know further xeroxing also 
So it was not that 
And Chicago linguistic society was the centre of learning
Yes that you mentioned 
Yes that was the centre of
For a while
For those it was known not there
Not there at all
He doesn't know how uh how much one word 
 was there
 One word 
Ah how much fun was there how much excitement was there 
You can imagine that somebody comes up with the bright idea 
and he doesn't wait for the next day to go and meet Macaulay 
 uhm and he writes up a note for pages and you know just push
it inside the door uhm 
And Macaulay comes and looks at the notes and decides
this is something which is really exciting and must be done 
So it's Macaulay who might justification for that
analysis
 I'm talking about electrical precomposition
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
Ah ha
Which was actually if I use the term invention
Uhm 
It was invented by his students not he
Uh ah 
But he gave the justification so there was no in in
terms of Macaulays one word 
Yeah you were asking about me you know how
did I
 Yeah 
Yeah one word 
How did I get into because I was also like you teaching
literature at the university and uh joined linguistics not
very seriously to begin with 
But one thing was there that I I did wonder about the way
literature was used in language this is one thing that's 
one word 
And then I was very deeply influenced by Professor Pundit 
He used to be the head uh English department 
And we had a very distinguished uh two words was there
then one word 
But Professor Pundit in particular and I got attracted to
socio- linguistic and I did a piece of work uh with with professor
Pundit on the teachers of Hindi trying to show how Hindi was 
diverging into different directions one would get Sanskritized one
word 
And then I did quite well in my M Ed and Mr Pundit thought
that I should be in two words in England 
And there I was quite deeply influenced by Professor one word
 as a socio-linguistic including also the work of a few words 
 parti particularly the work of one word because he was my
 one word 
 Accha 
And I worked on the Punjabi immigrants there 
I think that was the first uh research thesis on 
immigrants assimilation of the local language maintenance of their own
language and culture one of I think quiet often quoted 
Then I came back and uh fortunately got a job here 
teaching linguistics since but yeah
We can talk 
Uhn 
Uh well that's very fine I have no news since
nineteen eight years one word sometimes eighty or some
nine
 Yeah 
Eighty-seven perhaps
Uhn 
Little before that time seventy-eight seventy-nine yeah
No seventy-nine yeah because I came back in
seventy-nine
 Yeah 
Yeah okay,
We met in Hyderabad
Ah yeah that's true and since then all we
have been introduced to each other 
Why is it that uh you and I not have problems
 differental issues 
Uhm
Whereas I find that most socio-linguists uhm
 do not get along well with their colleagues 
 Uhm 
You see
I I am not talking just for personally
Yeah
Purely of academic level 
What is your view ?
You see I think uh the problem is that uh most
socio-linguists I know particular in the Indian context have opted
for socio-linguistic as a soft option 
Whereas they they don't want to understand I don't think you
can do good socio-linguistics without uh sort of fully understanding
the structure of language 
I think you have to be I think socio-linguist is is a
way of being a link and really it's just a bit one word 
So you have different perspective 
You may have a generative perspective but you may socio-
linguistic perspective
But both are trying to be linguist 
So I have I have always benifitted from what Chomsky had to
say or what the one word say or what other theoritical linguist
have to have to say 
I have never had any cult of socio 
 That's one word 
There is a point that if you are doing socio- linguistic
or one word linguistic you are concentrating from the
linguistic point of view either on phonology or morphology or syntax or
may be two of them or three of them
Yeah 
And each one has to had statistical approach other
than the question of socio-linguistic variables and how to analyse it and
then what kind of conclusions you want to draw 
Ah keeping that in mind do you think that there
should not be a conflict between theoritical linguistic and you know
socio-linguist
No I don't think I think they that the goals are 
common except I will add one one word now this is my recent in
the last three or four years 
Uh so far I'm concerned it should apply equally well
with theoritical linguist and socio-linguists 
But I think it applies more to socio-linguist because theoritical
linguist can always find other justifications which socio-linguist I
think will not be justify justifying with that 
I think socio-linguist has a social responsibility 
He cannot escape the question of language at all 
A pure theoritical linguist who is dealing with it pure as
pure form and a pure mathematical form will say I'm 
interested in abstract logic and mathematical development although he
may not you see but
