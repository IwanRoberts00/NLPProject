Anjani I have always wondered how did you enter the linguistics
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and Browning 
""
Henry James because I was working on him then
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in C I E F L 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He said  a teacher of literature I won't
do the job of this course 
""
""
 rigorous
training in linguistics during his days  but in his whole life he never
got  that he was teaching
only English and the English courses in classes 
""
""
""
""
""
I was the youngest person 
""
the syllabus 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if you agree to teach I will teach you 
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 actually
""
""
Traditional grammar in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
background for nessasary 
""
""
""
""
""
And of  particularly Jesperson and in the
""
""
""
Ahn ha
""
""
Then 
""
persuaded me to join the Central 
""
And there  somehow I came in very close contact with Professor
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In Hyderabad 
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
American  but I got along well with Yadurajan and Nambiar
""
""
""
""
""
And my  influenced by the
 in high school I was the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The other was  Masica
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then I wrote a paper that paper you know  which
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You know I was  uh called very urgently I had to go from
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
best because of conditional causes exactly and all that 
""
And then I got scholarship to go to Chicago 
""
""
Uh I was 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I was  and then I went for
""
""
""
""
""
I did not like  phonetics
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
""
like it 
""
""
in 
""
I said 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  of boring in the sense
that  destined to teach the same author because
""
""
""
You are right 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the best job
""
""
""
""
""
But what I teach in the classroom 
""
""
""
""
""
""
What what I acquired there
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
I think we were
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
Although  it all started with Chomsky himself
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  a few words
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
substantial 
""
""
 were very substantial
""
""
I see 
""
""
The issues were very substantial in the sense that generative
""
assupmtions and conclusions of this standard theory 
""
""
Uh ha 
""
""
And in that process they ran into trouble 
""
You  that all the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
why 
""
analyse what is here is the basic thing  the deep structure
""
So if all the meaning is there in the deep structure 
""
Then  in
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Which made the process very complex 
""
""
""
""
assumption
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And he said well  one word
""
""
""
And he
""
""
And that was it he  so
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But still he he maintains the point  to the extent that
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh  one
""
""
""
""
 uh uh founder of Chomsky
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And he becomes so powerful that you can't control it 
""
""
""
It is not possible I know 
""
""
No that is it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So the methodology with the generative semanticists developed
""
""
""
""
""
""
Which is so complex and so powerful  that it could explain
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And things like global 
""
""
""
""
""
Anything could be explained in terms of global concect 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And that turned majority of practitioners
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
It is true that uh you know the the financial crunch which you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that is including  themselves
""
""
No the point is how can  trying to make is
that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
I think that 
""
""
No no 
""
""
""
throughout the year 
""
""
The other 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
available as soon as they were titled
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And in some cases you know like sometimes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then there would be you know further xeroxing also 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For a while
""
""
""
""
""
Not there at all
""
""
He doesn't know how 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You can imagine that somebody comes up with the bright idea 
""
""
it inside the door 
""
And Macaulay comes  looks at the notes and decides
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
terms of Macaulays 
""
""
Yeah you were asking about me  how
did I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How did I get into  because I was also like you teaching
""
very seriously to begin with 
""
""
literature was used in language 
""
""
And then I was very deeply influenced by Professor Pundit
