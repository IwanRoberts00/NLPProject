""
""
Anjani I have always wondered how did you enter the linguistics
 ?
""
""
 the very interesting question
""
I  and in post
graduated classes 
and Browning 
""
Henry James because I was working on him then
""
And Browning because no one in that year was teaching Browning 
""
""
""
""
""
Which year was that  ?
""
""
That was long time back sixty-eight sixty-nine
""
""
Sixty-eight 
""
""
And then in under this graduate classes  something
very interesting happened
""
The university introduced 
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
And there was a professor  who was trained
in C I E F L 
ah ahn 
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ahn
""
""
But when he was asked to teach that course 
""
""
Oh
""
""
He said  a teacher of literature I won't
do the job of this course 
""
And now the head of the department of English in Science college
 rigorous
training in linguistics during his days  but in his whole life he never
got  that he was teaching
only English and the English courses in classes 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I was the youngest person 
okay  this is
the syllabus 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And if you agree to teach I will teach you 
how to teach grammar
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
""
So I availed  opportunity
like this yeah
""
""
Was it a sort of modern linguistic or it was a 
traditional grammar 
""
""
 was grammar in under graduate classes
""
""
I see 
""
""
 actually
""
""
Traditional grammar in 
""
""
You know Hornby books and some other books
""
""
I know
""
""
But Hornby was the main  and some books
which C I E F L has just published in linguistics 
""
""
""
""
""
So I said 
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
And when  very good
background for nessasary 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
And of  particularly Jesperson and in the
library at all college professors and all there so I got interested 
""
""
Ahn ha
""
""
Then 
""
persuaded me to join the Central 
""
And there  somehow I came in very close contact with Professor
Gokak
""
""
""
""
""
 one word
 Institute in sixty-five
""
""
Uhn
""
""
And that also was interesting in a different way 
""
In Patna university we had a book  practical views
 or the period
when 
""
And we would argue  the classroom
""
""
Who possibly could be the author  just observe it for the style
of writing 
""
And Professor Gokak started during that class of  kind of thing
in this class there
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
In Hyderabad 
""
So I could do very well
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
But I was never very close to  who was teaching
grammar
""
Somehow I didn't like him
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
I didn't like his assistant 
American  but I got along well with Yadurajan and Nambiar
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
And my  influenced by the
 in high school I was the
product of an English medium school 
""
Our teachers were mostly  helped
me in speaking nice English  and all his lessons particularly with
reference to long stresses 
""
Anyway then I went to  there was one
""
The other was  Masica
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
 for non- academic
reasons
""
We just became very friendly 
""
And then I wrote a paper that paper you know  which
was written 
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
""
You know I was  uh called very urgently I had to go from
""
""
And the day I was back 
submit the term paper 
""
So I had no time 
""
Touch  I think
""
""
In the train
""
""
 he was his
best because of conditional causes exactly and all that 
""
And then I got scholarship to go to Chicago 
Masica was 
""
Uh I was 
these people something happened 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So I was  and then I went for
""
""
And there I 
without 
""
I did not like  phonetics
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
You know Bansal was not there when I was there  I I didn't
like it 
""
And uh 
in 
""
I said 
""
So  but the main point I would say
 to remain a
teacher of English
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And  of boring in the sense
that  destined to teach the same author because
nobody else is ready to change his subject
""
""
You are right 
""
""
So you go on teaching the same
""
""
Year after year
""
""
Go on repeating the same thing year after the year 
""
Whereas in this discipline  whatever I learnt in Chicago this is
the best job
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But what I teach in the classroom 
 I was going to teach is very difficult
""
""
Is very difficult 
""
""
What what I acquired there
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So  and patience
which goes on time
""
What about you  ?
""
""
No when we went to Chicago I  interesting
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
I think we were
""
""
Yes
""
""
And that  debate between uh generative semanticists and
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
Although  it all started with Chomsky himself
""
I mean it all came out of 
""
""
""
right
""
""
And  a few words
 uh George Lakoff
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  it now seems that the issues were not really
substantial 
""
""
 were very substantial
""
""
I see 
""
""
The issues were very substantial in the sense that generative
semanticists 
assupmtions and conclusions of this standard theory 
""
""
Uh ha 
""
""
And in that process they ran into trouble 
""
You  that all the
meaning is there in the basic deep tructure
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
You know  you remember the earlier argument as to
why 
manner  but one can
analyse what is here is the basic thing  the deep structure
""
So if all the meaning is there in the deep structure 
""
Then  in
which 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Which made the process very complex 
""
Generative semanticists didn't find it 
""
They made it as complex as was necessary to  maintain this
assumption
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Chomsky on the other hand  when he
realized that it 
he withdrew himself 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And he said well  one word
""
""
""
And he
""
""
And that was it he  so
actually it was a better theory  one
word 
""
""
You know 
""
""
But still he he maintains the point  to the extent that
""
""
But as I was a part of this thing I can see that the issues were
really very very serious issues according to us 
""
""
But uh  one
word 
""
""
It it disappeared uh  two words
 uh uh founder of Chomsky
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uh you see if you make something very powerful
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And he becomes so powerful that you can't control it 
there is no
""
""
It is not possible I know 
""
""
No that is it 
""
Then it is no longer your methodology 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Do you remember the  story of this fossil
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So the methodology with the generative semanticists developed
""
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Which is so complex and so powerful  that it could explain
anything 
""
And  George Lakeoff
withdrew things like  had
constructed
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And things like global 
""
""
""
""
""
Anything could be explained in terms of global concect 
""
And he also introduced what he called  you know what is
technically is called 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
You know like it is uh say  uh
three two seven 
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Percent  uh now
""
""
Yes 
""
""
That type of calculation
""
""
Pure mathematical conclusion 
""
""
And that turned majority of practitioners
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
It is true that uh you know the the financial crunch which you
mention the other day
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
That plays a very trivial role because there were other
people who had  uh have always have big problems
that is including  themselves
""
""
No the point is how can  trying to make is
that 
""
And there was no 
forming of
""
""
No no there was
""
""
Society like group 
""
""
No no there was a cohesive group
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
I think that 
""
""
No no 
""
""
There was a cohesive group  though not located in Chicago
throughout the year 
""
""
The other 
""
""
 the centre
 lot of their income on
""
""
""
I see  okay
""
""
And free  uh
available as soon as they were titled
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And in some cases you know like sometimes 
like 
""
""
Uhn
""
""
And he just get it xeroxed 
one word 
""
And then there would be you know further xeroxing also 
""
So it was not that 
""
And Chicago linguistic society was the centre of learning
""
""
Yes that you mentioned 
""
""
Yes that was the centre of
""
""
For a while
""
""
For those it was known  not there
""
""
Not there at all
""
""
He doesn't know how 
 was there
""
""
""
""
""
Ah how much fun was there how much excitement was there 
""
You can imagine that somebody comes up with the bright idea 
and he doesn't 
 just push
it inside the door 
""
And Macaulay comes  looks at the notes and decides
this is something which 
""
So  Macaulay who might justification for that
analysis
""
 talking about electrical precomposition
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Which was  actually if I use the term invention
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
It was invented by  his students not he
""
""
Uh ah 
""
""
But he gave the justification  in in
terms of Macaulays 
""
""
Yeah you were asking about me  how
did I
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
How did I get into  because I was also like you teaching
literature  not
very seriously to begin with 
""
But one thing was there that I  I did wonder about the way
literature was used in language 
one word 
""
And then I was very deeply influenced by Professor Pundit 
""
He used to be the head 
""
And we had a very distinguished uh  was there
then 
""
But Professor Pundit in particular  and I got attracted to
socio- linguistic  uh with with professor
Pundit on the teachers of Hindi 
diverging into different directions  one
word 
""
And then I did quite well in my M Ed  and Mr Pundit thought
that I should be in 
""
And there I was quite deeply influenced by Professor  one word
""
 because he was my
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I worked on the Punjabi 
""
I think that was the first uh 
immigrants assimilation of the local language  maintenance of their own
language and culture 
""
Then I came back and uh 
teaching linguistics since  yeah
""
""
We can talk 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Uh well  very fine I have no news since
nineteen eight years  sometimes eighty or some
nine
""
""
""
""
""
Eighty-seven perhaps
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Little before that time  seventy-eight seventy-nine yeah
""
""
No seventy-nine  because I came back in
seventy-nine
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah okay,
""
We met in Hyderabad
""
""
Ah yeah  all we
have been introduced to each other 
""
""
Why is it that uh  problems
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Whereas I find that most  uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
You see
""
""
I I am not talking just for personally
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Purely of academic level 
""
What is your view  ?
""
""
You see I think uh the problem is that uh  most
socio-linguists I know  have opted
for socio-linguistic as a soft option 
""
Whereas they they don't want to understand  I don't think you
can do good socio-linguistics  sort of fully understanding
the structure of language 
""
I think you have to be  is a
way of being a link 
""
""
So you have different perspective 
""
""
You may have a generative perspective but you may socio-
linguistic perspective
""
""
But both are trying to be linguist 
""
So I have  I have always benifitted from what Chomsky had to
say or what the  theoritical linguist
have to 
""
I have never had any cult 
""
""
""
""
""
There is a point  that if you are doing socio- linguistic
or  from the
linguistic point of view  either on phonology or morphology or syntax or
may be two of them or three of them
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And each one  other
than the question of  socio-linguistic variables and how to analyse it and
then what kind of conclusions you want to draw 
""
Ah  there
should not be a conflict between theoritical linguistic and  you know
socio-linguist
""
""
No I don't think 
common except I will add one  now this is my recent in
the last three or four years 
""
Uh  concerned it should apply equally well
with theoritical linguist and socio-linguists 
""
But I think it applies more to socio-linguist because theoritical
linguist can always find other justifications  which socio-linguist I
think will not be 
""
""
I think socio-linguist 
""
He cannot escape the question of language at all 
""
A pure theoritical linguist  who is dealing with it pure as
pure form 
interested in abstract logic and mathematical development  he
may not
