doctor wee if i may be permitted to go through the injuries with you look at the external injuries according to the post-mortem report the external injuries started from one two three four five and so on we will start with the first one superficial cut on the left forehead across the left upper eyelid do you have a copy of the photographs you are taking doctor wee through the external injuries through all the slash wounds and stab wounds and with reference to the photographs yes first injury on your medical report doctor wee could you take a look yes this is seen in p thirty-one p thirty-one superficial cut on left forehead is it this is a cut on the face around the eye and down to the cheek on the face right yes the one you see in p thirty-one yes coming down the nose is it inner aspect of the left inner aspect of the left eye all right that is the first injury this would be consistent doctor wee with would it be consistent with injury caused by a sharp object sharp instrument such as a parang yes the tip of the parang the second injury doctor wee is a slash wound with sharp edges and forked anterior tip over the occipita-parietal scalp where would that this is seen in p thirty-four and thirty-five p thirty-four shows the injury with the hair still on his head yes and p thirty thirty-five with the head shaved yes could you briefly describe this wound to us it has not penetrated the skull it did not crack the skull or it did not go into the skull cavity or affected the brain but it has cut through the skin and flesh of the head until it reaches the skull yes it only cut the thickness of the scalp and outer table of the skullbone and this would also be consistent with the injuries caused by a sharp instrument like that of parang third injury doctor wee is an tangential slash wound yes this is seen in p thirty-five p thirty-five also and thirty-three this is where part of the scalp being slashed off yes one moment p thirty-three and thirty-five thirty-three is the injury somewhere near the ear is it yes where part of the scalp is sliced off doctor wee could you see photographs eight and nine yes would that be the piece of scalp that had been sliced off yes it would my lord the scale in eight and nine was found in the hotelroom yes and this injury is again consistent with that caused by a sharp instrument like that of a parang before i go on to the other i go on to the injuries first the neck has no injuries no the injury on the chest there is a vertical slash wound on the right anterior shoulder with sharp edges where can you find this it is seen in p thirty-five and thirty-one there is a deep slash wound on the right shoulder isn't it yes again sharp instrument sharp instrument yes a sharp instrument like that of a parang and there is the fifth injury on the report which is the fatal stab wound fifth injury fatal stab wound triangular stab wound left anterolateral mid-chest wall where can we find this p twenty-eight and thirty-one let's look at it twenty-eight shows about three stab wounds which of these the one nearest the left nipple would your lordship want doctor wee to mark the injury no near the nipple we can see that yes and the same injury can also be seen my lord in p thirty-one yes it is also near the left nipple compared to the other injuries so far seen looking at the photograph it doesn't seem to be a very serious one but i suppose doctor wee is going to explain to us yes could you describe to us the wound and tell us why it is the fatal wound this is a triangular stab wound it penetrated the full thickness of the chest wall it went into the right side of the heart because there was penetration into the heart i considered that this wound was the fatal wound the most serious of the most serious of the rest now this wound doctor wee would be consistent with how would you say this wound had been caused yes with what instrument would this wound be caused it's caused by a sharp instrument which is triangular on cross-section sharp doctor wee means pointed as opposed to the sharpness of a parang the edges of a parang yes it is a pointed instrument yes sharp pointed instrument what he means is it's a pointed instrument a pointed sharp in that a pointed instrument can you give us some examples pointed tip like a bearing scraper anything else any other sharp instrument that is triangular on cross-section can you explain the expression triangular on cross-section the blade if one were across and look at it it should be triangular it is a cross-section yes taking a cross-section of it and when we look at it it is triangular in shape yes so it could be something like a bearing scraper a metal file a sharp metal file with a pointed tip which is triangular in shape would that yes it would would that instrument be consistent with the wound caused by such an instrument a metal what did you say mister a sharp pointed metal file with a triangular shape metal file with a triangular cross-section no no leave the cross-section alone moderate force moderate force was used you need only a moderate force to penetrate with this type of instrument yes and while we are still at this injury perhaps you can tell us from your observation would an assailant who uses this instrument would he be which position would he be vis-a-vis the deceased would you be able to tell us looking at the wound and the track most likely to be a frontal frontal attack frontal attack yes we go on to the next wound doctor wee before i go to the next wound this wound and the four other wounds which you have just described would you say that they are caused by different instruments yes it cannot be the same instrument no definitely a different instrument yes it was not a parang anyway no this fifth wound was not caused by a parang no could not have been that explains the difference in the wounds as shown in the photographs yes wound number six this is also another stab wound right anterolateral mid chest wall where can you find before you go to the sixth wound mister seng can you ask him some questions on or would you be coming back to it later as to the cause of death i will go through the wounds first and then all right very well so that we have an idea of what the wounds are before very well and because the witness said that is a fatal wound we will come back to that later i'll be asking him about the other wound as well now you are on the sixth wound yes where is it to be found where can you find the sixth wound doctor wee sorry the picture is not very clear it is at the side of p thirty-one it is very hard to see perhaps you could mark the or show his lordship where the wound is circle it and mark number six yes that is the sixth wound p thirty-one and would you say that this wound could be caused by the same instrument or similar instrument that has caused the fifth wound yes consistent with the triangular sharp instrument yes not a parang no now the seventh wound which is a slash wound number seven where can you find this wound in the photographs p thirty-two there are two the one nearer the neck yes there are two wounds two very clear wounds yes nearer the armpit yes the one near the armpit the bigger of the two wounds shown on the photograph yes and this would he consistent with that caused by a parang yes a parang slashed caused by a parang and the eighth slash wound it is the one below the seventh wound yes that is also consistent with that caused by a sharp object like a parang yes like a parang the ninth wound is a stab wound at the abdomen which photograph would that be p twenty-eight there are three there the one nearest the navel the one in the centre yes has your lordship got it yes that is the ninth stab yes the other one is of course the fatal wound isn't it that is at the nipple yes doctor wee my first question is taking the injuries as a whole all the injuries if the deceased had been rushed to hospital immediately would he likely have been saved no any possibility what time frame are you speaking about mr tan immediately after he sustained the injuries my lord i know immediately means within two minutes or ten minutes or what within ten minutes if he had been rushed to the hospital not likely is it a question of degree or is it simply improbable to save his life improbable and even if you are given half a day to treat him would you be able to save his life sorry i didn't hear the question if a team of doctors are given half a day to treat his injuries would his life be saved unlikely you see the doctor has already said if he was rushed to hospital within ten minutes he was unlikely to be saved how could a team of doctors for half a day do anything better yes carry on i read in the report doctor wee the time of death was at zero zero forty-eight minutes after midnight forty-eight minutes after midnight yes doctor wee could you tell the court when did the ambulance arrive mister tan just to follow your line of cross-examination the ambulance arrived at about i think the ambulance arrived fairly quickly isn't it from the call about nine minutes about ten minutes later he was sent to the hospital that is right that is my recollection yes my lord what i want to confirm is the time of death doctor wee where did you get the information from this information was given to us on the police three zero three report and the medical officer in charge at the hospital must have certified death now do you have a copy of that certification here no but it was stated in the three zero three police report that doctor meret certified death at zero zero forty-eight hours  i solemnly and sincerely swear that the evidence i will be giving in this court shall be the truth the whole truth
