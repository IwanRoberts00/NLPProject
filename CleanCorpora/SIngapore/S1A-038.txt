""
""
uh which holiday are you talking about
""
""
talking about our next year holiday hor
""
""
i thought we agree we go to canada
""
so that canada is definite right
""
""
something like that lah
""
""
what do you mean something like that
""
canada is definite
""
otherwise i don't want to go anywhere
""
""
i thought we're going europe
""
""
uhm canada and europe
""
can can we combine together the two
""
""
it'll be pretty expensive uh so we have to plan it properly
""
otherwise the cost will be very high
""
""
but some of my friends said that it's not possible
""
they say that you'll take too long and that it's uhm it's going to
be a very expensive
""
like you said it's going to be very expensive
""
""
 word 
""
""
then they say that uhm
""
can we get to see uhm very much of the two countries if we do it
this way you know hopping from canada to europe
""
what do you think
""
""
no we can have a short stay in canada first
""
we don't have to visit the whole of canada
""
just visit few important cities that are interesting
""
""
but i thought canada is so big and uh i
""
""
ya but we don't have to go everywhere
""
for example okay just go toronto to see the largest city in canada
""
then we can take a bus and travel across the canadian provinces
from ontario to manitova to uh british columbia then go vancouver
""
from there we'll hop into the plane and then proceed to europe
""
""
that means we're going to hop you're going to hop onto a plane
at vancouver
""
""
ya we can stay in canada for about a week or a week and a half
""
""
can we see
""
can we still see so many things
""
""
yes
""
""
in a week
""
""
yes
""
""
but uhm what about the the wild life
""
that's what i want to see
""
i want to see can the canadian uhm the canadian countryside the
indian villages and you know
""
all those all those famous lakes and uhm
""
what do you call those uh uhm uhm reserves the natural reserves
nature reserves
""
sorry
""
""
of course
""
depends on what you want to see where you want to go you see
""
one and half week should be more than enough because in toronto
we'll just stay for two days
""
all right from toronto we travel to manitova
""
that'll take about two and a half days in between the bus
""
""
bus journey uh
""
""
roads
""
ya bus journey we can uh to stop by way along the way from toronto
to manitova to see countryside where the prairies are
""
then if you want to go and see that indian villages at vancouver
""
remember the book did i will call my name
""
""
was it was it vancouver
""
was it was
""
""
ya ya
""
""
set in vancouver
""
""
that was in vancouver
""
that's where the book i will call my name is set
""
that'll take another three days
""
so it's about seven and a half days
""
only seven and a half days
""
add another two more days for travelling from manitova to vancouver
""
so it'll be just nice
""
of course it'll be a little bit a little bit rush a little bit
hectic uh but i think we can manage it
""
""
so you already have a rough itinerary planned is it
""
""
yes
""
""
darling
""
""
 word  half week
""
if not we can we can actually just drop in at vancouver and forget
about toronto
""
""
no i want to see as much of canada as possible and i also want
to go to lake  word  university
""
cos i want to see i want to see your university
""
i want to see how small it is and and how obscure it is
""
""
shut up
""
""
why you you insulted uh i insulted your university uhm
""
but seriously i want to see where you spend that three years of
your life pursuing your degree and and also uhm want to see who are these
professors who talk about who seem to think so highly of you
""
i want to find out whether is it true that they really think so
highly of you
""
""
anyway we can always take a plane from toronto to vancouver or
take a plane from lake  word  to vancouver
""
that will cut down the journey from one and a half weeks to one
week maybe
""
""
but doesn't it mean
""
""
then we spend another three more weeks in europe
""
""
no but isn't taking planes even inter-city planes isn't it uhm
more expensive than taking the bus
""
the greyhound is it
""
is it the greyhound
""
they have greyhounds
""
""
of course
""
""
in canada
""
""
of course
""
""
i thought greyhound's only used in the united states
""
""
no it's trans-north america
""
""
oh
""
so if we take the plane we we will have to pay more right
""
is it very much more
""
""
from where
""
""
i don't know
""
you just said that from one from vancouver to toronto and then or
from lake  word  upwards
""
""
of course uh
""
from toronto to vancouver cost us about four hundred canadian
dollars
""
""
air ticket uh
""
""
ya one way from
""
""
then what about if we take the greyhound bus
""
""
greyhound is about two hundred over canadian
""
but they are valid for thirty days
""
""
oh so if so i guess that we'll be doing most of our
travelling by the greyhound right unless we're really
""
""
yes  word  if we are if we planned to see
the countryside
""
""
then we have to take the bus
""
""
ya
""
""
uhm good
""
i can't wait for this holiday so i've been thinking and thinking
""
""
don't think too much
""
plan for it
""
""
i can't wait for our second honeymoon and and and really
think i deserve a holiday
""
after all this june holidays i hardly in fact we didn't go
anywhere out of singapore
""
""
okay okay
""
so one and a half week in canada canada
""
where what else
""
""
uhm see
""
i also want to go to some of the places you have some of the
places where you you have skid
""
uh to see you in action since you claim that you are such a
wonderful skier
""
i i want to see you go down the slopes and you know
""
see how wonderful
""
""
tumble down right
""
""
no no i didn't say tumble down
""
you don't
""
""
snowing down right
""
""
uh
""
""
rolling down
""
""
snowballing down maybe
""
""
so horrible
""
""
no
""
i really want to see
""
i i only see you skate
""
""
any any anyway where which europe country are we going
""
""
why you so keen to change the conversation
""
i'm still interested in canada for your information
""
""
too short
""
too short a day too short the days to to discuss too detailed
about what to
""
unless you want to spend more than two weeks but that's our not
the original plan
""
so i think we sh
""
""
i i don't think we have even discussed the original plan
""
""
i think you better discuss some which country you want to
visit which countries which which which you want to visit in europe
""
""
uhm
""
do we do
""
ouch
""
stop pinching me
""
do we want to go to europe or just or just england
""
""
i thought you want to visit most most of europe
""
then how come now england only
""
""
i don't think we can
""
i mean we i i think we really got to plan uh our european tour
very carefully
""
because i don't think we're going to get to see very much of one
country if we intend to hop you know
""
if we intend to cover as many countries as possible in europe
""
in fact uhm i think if we if we decide to go europe we might as
well give up england you know
""
because england by itself by itself has got so much to offer i
mean in terms of sight
""
and i mean tour tourist sights and historical i mean hist
historical sights as well
""
so some of my friends have told me that actually you can spend
maybe a whole month in england
""
so i think maybe we either go england and spend the three weeks
there or we we we go just europe backpacking in europe
""
and if we do backpacking in europe i think we should uhm visit
places like uhm okay definitely france uhm holland holland mainly because i
want to see the tulip the tulips and the uhm what uh
""
the tulips the windmills and cer and and a little bit of the
redlight district to find out whether it's really really red
""
""
so that's definitely europe tour
""
""
and i have said uhm i don't mind spending the whole
""
""
in that case got to see a lot more and cut down the number of
days in canada
""
""
no but i want
""
""
because anyway you cannot spend too much time and too much
money on one trip
""
""
but i uhm actually uh i'd rather concentrate more on canada
""
i know you you have spent three years you have spent three years
there darling so that therefore therefore you therefore you want to go europe
whereas for me i haven't seen canada right and neither have i seen europe
""
but i'm more interested in canada because because that's kind of a
second home to you so it's for your sake
""
""
it's okay for the first trip we just go canada and england
and that's it
""
""
canada and england
""
""
then for the europe trip we should make it on a second round
where where we'll visit the real europe
""
""
but will we be able to have another backpacking trip
""
""
why not
""
""
because by that time what happens if we if
""
""
buy some four-ds
""
""
what happen what happen if if if i get pregnant
""
and then how am i going to backpack with with a child inside me
""
""
you front pack
""
""
don't talk nonsense
""
front pack
""
but uh i don't know
""
you sound really keen to go to europe
""
you really want to go europe uh
""
""
whoa you don't have to be so nice  word 
""
okay so so countryside
""
""
you mean you don't mind not going back to canada next year uh
""
""
of course not
""
of course i'd like to visit to if i can make it a chance see visit
instead of backpacking visit
""
""
uhm why
""
i want to backpack
""
""
or we just visit one or two cities
""
""
so few uh
""
""
all i can say make it into two trips
""
first trip two countries
""
three four years later another trip
""
""
uhm
""
""
maybe by then they have invented space shuttle around the
world
""
""
space shuttle round the world
""
""
ya
""
""
who would who will invent it
""
you right
""
""
of course
""
""
aiyah still can't decide whether to go just canada and
england or or a little bit of each
""
i think
""
""
anyway don't forget you also have to save for the renovation
of the house
""
""
so that what does that mean
""
we still got to decide right
""
""
no one piece of  word  you cannot cut into
too many pieces
""
it'll cut you right
""
""
so what are you trying to say philosopher
""
yep please please go on and explain your your your wise saying
""
""
so it's either we have more money for one trip more places
but less stays per places or multiple trips longer days per places and wait
longer in in between the trips
""
""
or what we can do is we can still go canada one and a half
weeks and then maybe select certain cities in europe
""
that means we don't get to cover all of europe right or like you
said we just go canada and england
""
what do you think about that
""
""
england is part to europe
""
""
no england is separate by itself
""
""
it's now part of eec
""
they have a common dollar now
""
""
so okay lah since you want to be so so so
""
""
there's a tube now
""
""
you want to be
""
""
from england to to french
""
""
england to france uh
""
""
naw to french because it's french fries
""
""
uhm don't talk nonsense
""
we're taped so i guess really have to discuss this a little
further right 
""
but have no time to talk about the car already so i think uhm ya
we'll discuss the other issues another day right
