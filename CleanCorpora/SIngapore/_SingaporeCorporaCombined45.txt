that means you wrote in first is it and then they short list those people for the test that's right i i heard on the radio and then they short list you for in voice test because thanks uncle that means you went through the voice test already so this is the next stage ya the voice test is very fun the voice test very fun that means after this no more lah two rounds i think if you get short listed again you go for the interview uh that's right that's right ya because for the nus one i went for the written test as well so terrible lah they say you are short listed for english test so you go you write a essay and a and a and a formal letter to invite mr x to come here for a stress management workshop something like that uh because it's uh administrative assistant for extra department of extra-mural studies just like you know like outside courses ya ya those are extra-mural lor so i i didn't know what's extra-mural i just know that i'm qualified for it then i applied it's not easy uh i tell you so how i mean at least i'm short listed for interviews so it's not bad ya at least you've a chance you see uhm ya i've got a friend uh i don't know how many companies she wrote into you know and then not one interview ya lor yet the thing is that i don't have enough interviews but what what is her qualification uh just a bachelor degree ya ya lor honours is nothing unless you you you can get a job then you earn a bit more something like that i'm not sure but you start with a higher pay start with a higher pay but for sbc if you want to go into the executive post uh you must have honours at least only government is like that ya actually i don't i don't think there is a difference ah honestly just spend one more year uh so but this one is radio presenter i didn't know you have to go through test for this kind of stuff i i thought just go for interview i mean from there they can judge what but at least voice test they must hear you over the ya lah  word i'm sort of expected a voice test but written test like word  for my friend she just she was just applying for programmer you know like you slot in programmes and then you've to go a test also they have english one and chinese one i should have asked for chinese and english then i try which one i get in because like this kind of of stuff uh radio is mainly research students gone through a degree uh and honours you've got sufficient skills no lah i've no general knowledge ya it's the general knowledge that that see they may interview you on that but not a written test but actual but written test on general knowledge what i just don't know you know because normally i read english newspaper also if when i do read ya then these few days oh you don't read the chinese as well these few days i read chinese lah i can't stand it because a lot of things we learn in english ya you do you don't you take for granted ya and when it comes to chinese you just you sometimes it just hits you oh no what is it called like if you ask me what is the ivu i also don't know what is it called so it's quite bad why don't you try for the english department i didn't try lah you write into i think it's it'll be much easier you know chinese is like but i thought chinese it's easier is easier for me ah it is easier is it for me to talk in chinese you know uh really well in a way but not not ya lah my my general knowledge is just terrible lah oh because at home you speak mandarin right uhm ya all of you well one or two of us in english lah then mix here and there alright even speaking to each other in your your siblings in mandarin ya uh i think my main killer was the general knowledge only one out of so many or one or two i don't know aye my is just as bad you know ya i have no general knowledge you know is like ya so terrible even when i try to read papers ah i don't i don't remember what i read ya you just read and read and ya i really force myself to read and then okay imagine you have to write out what you want to interview them and then you have to write uhm come up with intelligent questions otherwise it'll be like oh no and these people are big shots you know ya  word if you ask them what will they think of you so entertainment programme i wasn't expecting things like that because entertainment is so i know quite a bit of about those who is who and whatever and all the gossips ya gossips very good thank god i resitted for the test and then ask me this kind of thing i suppose they expect you to reach a certain standard ya even in uh uhm right when i did my radio programme ah uhm for the beginners uh of course you do things like read you know a story or things like that but when they went on to advance uh you can't do those entertainment programmes you know like my friend you know you've got to do an academic subject ya so he he majored in econs also so he did on econs that means on air you know nearly go on air every week ya it's just those ca things right ya but he loves econs so it's oh that's fine ya he read papers get the all the cut outs and then analyse and then over the radio he presents i don't mind doing some classical music sort of thing you know don't ask me to do this i hate it i mean when you don't have the interest it's very difficult to go in ya and then you're not graded for it ya so it's all self-discipline i know lah it's something i should know can't blame anyone you can go into research what sbc like what you know like uhm current affairs or you know uhm feedback that kind of thing as a researcher i think it's interesting i don't know if they want me no you apply for it lah honours grad honours also you go to you go and get the uhm forms i think i i still have i still have i have one extra and they have got all the different departments no but you're only suppose to write in when they advertise for it can't you just write in like that guess word they what is fated unless you know somebody in there go straight ah then you you have oh we need someone someone just resigned and all you don't wait until the papers come out who resign martin soong resign who resign i know that guy ya not easy uh that time i was i went for a interview with sbc i think it was uh no really you got ya no written test ah no there was just interview i think it was uh what post was it uh some executive i think uhm ya some executive i think written uh so they ask you whether you are interested you know as an editor and that kind of stuff in sbc so no i mean i give my views because they say sometimes they they look at my resume and then you know they say you're very involved in church work but sometimes sundays you may need to come back to work so you can't lah so i said no lah in that case you know uhm ya i don't know hopefully i just in nus that'll be good boring job lah hey he is in nus who chris researcher ya i know r and d but but but uhm ya so what the thing is they were asking for researchers but uhm why ah did i have to write there's something that i just can't be bothered to write so what's that uhm i think i have to hand in something that to show our research or something then also three referees that can commend on your research ability as well oh that means that will have to be academics ya all the academics from australia and i only have maximum two 'cause our ours our department is so small unless i go to the french department which i don't think they should be able to commend on my research ability because what about your undergrad tutors undergrad loh ya because linguistics is very small department uhm they teach all level uhm aye are we going to start or what i don't know we are still waiting for angela she's not here she's working as i think estate real estate or something like that oh ya very word  ah it's very tough don't mind go and do rental it's easier you want to try to sell a house is so difficult it is you know ya but then you you have everything is comes in millions of dollars but i don't know what uh position she is holding whether is she a sales or ya i don't know so she wrote in i don't know i don't really know how she got the job but she was thinking of going into teaching or something ya that's what i heard ya but i think her parents uh doesn't encourage that uh her parents are teachers ya every time i go for those government interviews a lot of them ask me why don't i go into teaching oh because we have got that's why i was thinking if i really want to go into teaching i would have gone i don't need to go into teaching as well then i get very then the pub people were were quite mean i had an interview last friday pub ya they they say why you did so badly for your 'a' levels uhm what what else uhm something lah is it because of i said uh because i was i wasn't very interested in what i was doing and and i was quite involved in my word  you were in science is it yes oh and i did science in in 'o' level as well lah i see but then at that time i wanted to go away i just can't be but i didn't say things like that and then he said oh is it because of puppy love it's like i was so because what puppy love i mean how can you say word  how can you ask things like that it's so how can it ya it's very personal i don't think what what has to go it doesn't have and he was very patronising the way he asked it i mean if you do it as a joke i can accept it ya but the way he did it was very okay never mind then he he say but but uhm but you did well when you do science and what whatever you know i was very i said i just said definitely not word  because i wasn't ya that was the truth because i just wanna go away then sometimes these people uh terrible you know i mean i'm here to apply for a job you're not ya creating me for i'm not trying to get a scholarship from you ya so i don't think they have a right to i should have just blasted them but i just didn't
