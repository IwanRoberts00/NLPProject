the dream team and they're all back sundram moorthy often described as the most skilful player on the field malek awak the most hardworking player and asset to any team often called the dynamo abbas saad play maker alistar edwards also back with a nice personal touch in more ways than one and of course singapore's golden boy fandi ahmad everyone's model player i spoke with patrick ang the general manager and the man who did the wheeling and dealing to make this team possible and their presence is certainly felt in the team well sentiments are quite mixed for the older they're glad to be back for reasons personal or otherwise for the younger ones is un understandable if they feel they are a little overlooked but whatever it is the team spirit and morale is quite high well definitely better than last year which everyone remembered as the dooms year for local soccer not the least of which the singapore team was relegated to division two i spoke to the present coach p n sivaji but he told me that he rather not make any comments as he wanted to fully concentrate on training the boys at this point in time however the problems that plagued local soccer last year were not unfamiliar coaches went in and out there was mismanagement of the team and lack of commitment from the players themselves as a result games were lost many fans turned away from soccer and the kallang roar died but today many have come back because of the new team and the exciting prospects of winning the malaysia cup but former skipper of the national team terry pamanathan feels that having good players might not always mean winning the game so is this then a sign of better things to come for singapore soccer  hi i'm lisa today hey singapore goes to seletar the name seletar was said to have come from the term orang seletar which refers to the natives which raffles encountered when he first landed in singapore in 1925 the hms pergasus completed a most successful and historic voyage of discovery for the royal british airforce or raf the pioneers of the pergasus had found the size of the future airbase thus starting a long association of the raf with singapore and these men were part of the first squadron flying halfway around the world clearing the site posed difficulties including having to do the overhauling in the open but even before being officially declared open the airbase was already part of the greatest flight in history in 1928 during the far east flight upon its completion the airbase welcomed celebrities and aviation access to their grounds sir charles word smith considered one of the great pilots of all time landed in seletar in 1930 as part of his record-breaking flight from england to australia another familiar name is britain's amy johnson the first woman to make the solo flight from britain to australia in may 1930 the weather-beaten gypsy moth arrived safely in seletar despite battling the monsoon rains other celebrities to also use the base included one of silver screen's leading men douglas fairbank senior a frequent visitor was english playwright actor composer director sir noel howard many aviation adventurers and different aircraft models had made their way or passed through seletar but the giant silver word plane sunderland was the longest serving raf aircraft in singapore the word torpedo bomber was also included in the number 36 squadron and the burmese incident further saw the need to beef up the squadron thus the inclusion of the word torpedo bombers the peace time task of the air base came to an abrupt end with the onset of world war ii recognising the strength of the base the japanese navy quickly restored seletar making it fully operational and named it seletar  word  the need for ammunition caused the japanese to ship any available metal to japan including the removal of metal girdles off these hangars seletar ville continued its peaceful operations after the war the countess mounbatten of burma paid a special visit and so did the duke and duchess of word during the royal tour of the far east in 1952 the air base has gone through several phases since its completion and with the establishment of the saf training centre in june 1965 it marked the gradual end of raf in singapore initially operations at the air base were peaceful in nature including conducting of surveys metereological flights and escorting vips however incidents like the burmese rebellion in the 1930s showed the need to modernise the air base this led to the housing of local employees and later on the raf officers in an area known as seletar ville but where is seletar ville currently to find out join us after the break that in turn led to a residential area affectionately known as seletar ville found within seletar camp complex jalan kayu was named after mr c e woods the principal works and building officer-in-charge of the original air base but due to his request the malay equivalent of his name is used instead another thing that tells you 'you're here' are these guarded gates but what lies beyond them let's find out entering the complex is like venturing into another country altogether not only are there no tall buildings to block your view there is no heavy traffic thus ensuring minimum noise and air pollution what would greet you are decades old terraces and semi-detached houses built ages ago greenery and narrow winding roads take a look at some of these landmarks that should surely take you back in time seletar ville still uses most of its original road names and just rattling these names often would make it seem like you are in england instead of singapore most of the houses here are unique in their own ways and residents are able to add their personal touch to the surroundings as shown by the cute and artistic letter boxes here the plants are definitely an interesting sight which we will explore later but i was curious to find out more about the lifestyle here so i went to see april and jerry word  residents here since twenty years ago the west camp is where you will find seletar airport which is run by the civil aviation authority of singapore and it is from here that all air traffic is controlled from this relatively new tower you can actually see some old landmark particularly the old tower some of the old landmarks within seletar air base dated as far back as the early days of the raf unfortunately the original structures had to make way due to the ravages of world war ii and later further expansion the airport has had a few towers built since 1928 the current change is due to the ever expanding role of the airport that sees the need for new facilities to be accommodated thus the old tower had to be abandoned but recognising its historical value the tower though deserted still remains and taking over its air control responsibilities is this new tower the highest structure in seletar new hangars have been built to replace the old ones although the japanese removed the metal girdles off the original hangars to ship to japan the infrastructures remained and those who wish to know when the structures were built there is the date for all to see a year after the air base was officially opened the war wiped out almost everything and within the air field a little evidence remains to show just how bad this thick metal door has holes all over caused by bomb shrapnels yes the force and hear of the shrapnels melted parts of the door flying is one of the favourite past-times of the residents here however its role as the base for general aviation has taken up most of the air space sir word governor of straits settlement in 1930 was quoted to have said that singapore would become one of the largest and most important airports in the world based on what seletar airport alone has turned out he would have been proud of his prediction the services within the airfield varies aircrafts like the c130 as technician mike explains are always on standby for possible refueling of planes or cargo shipments seletar's peace time task of 60 years ago are still maintained when the need arise word or aircrafts for medical attention and evacuation like this helicopter could be counted on in cases of emergency seletar airport runs commercial and non-commercial flights although the two make up only a small percentage of the total air movement the flight ranges from regular commuter operations to tioman daily cargo flights to batam and bringing in fresh seafood for restaurants here if the original air base saw the likes of screen idols kings and ministers the new passenger terminal also has a list of whos's who many personalities have chosen seletar airport for its privacy these included mega stars like jackie chan jean claude van-damme cindy crawford and many more maintenance is still very much a part of the airport's services the availability of facilities in seletar sees aircrafts from around the region seeking maintenance at the air base with about 9000 air movements per month the air port definitely has its hands full and contributing greatly to the functioning and safety of aviation at seletar are a group of people working behind the scene just like any other airport the air traffic controllers work round the clock to ensure smooth and safe air traffic flow although seletar airport today functions as a general aviation airport the majority of its flying movements still come from flying training it also continues to be a place for young singaporeans to realise their dreams of learning how to fly the wings of singapore continues to soar with the increasing interest of aviation shown by the current crop of youngsters and all their interest began in 1928 when the republic of singapore flying club was founded although it cost quite a bit to get your flying license it sure beat swinging a golf club dennis tell us more well that's a sum that most students can't afford but if they meet the pre-requisites the youth flying club is the place for such young aspiring pilots now apart from the singapore flying club there is the youth flying club which also organises activities for schools mainly flying training and of course i am not going to miss that for the world okay i'll close the door and off we go to check out what more seletar has to offer this time taking a bird's eye view during the flight i was given a few flying tips and learned more on seletar when the raf first decided on seletar mangrove swamps have to be filled in hills removed and rubber trees cut down as seletar continues to play its role as general aviation venue for the region there has been an increasing need for space thus the area around it has been reclaimed to provide land for any further expansion plans just imagine that in seletar alone there are three golf courses to be found there is the seletar base golf course just next to the runway the seletar country club golf course and just next to yishun new town the orchid golf course imagine the sight seen by the crew of the far east flight who recced seletar back in 1927 now instead of swamp land cultivated trees lined the residential areas of ang mo kio and yishun and here it's a little trivial did you know that the fresh water at lower seletar reservoir is separated from the sea water by the stretch of land of yishun avenue one interesting ah well with some help from major leong i had a chance to pilot the plane for seven whole seconds  it was thrilling for me but i can't say the same for my very worried camera man with the spectacular view of the singapore oological gardens from the air we decided it was time to take the plane back home it was definitely a flight that will be etched in my mind for a long long time seletar has managed to retain the unmistakable beauty of its natural surrounding which hopefully will be preserved i am lisa from hey singapore good night
