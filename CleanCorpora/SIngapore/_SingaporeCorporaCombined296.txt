friends this election is not about a mandate for the pap or for even mr goh chok tong the pap have 41 seats they have the mandate and they are the government for another 5 years if you can believe their promises this election is now about whether we the people of singapore will be able to send a few opposition members to parliament to perform the correct role and job the opposition should make the political system that we have in singapore is based on an assumption that there will be always at least two parties in parliament if there is not then checks and balances which the system provides will not work effectively there will be no harmony in parliament there will be no balance it is not enough to have one opposition mp that is like asking one man to hold back the river or the sea by himself he can do nothing but if there are others to help him he can build the wall he can build the dam and stop the water how does an opposition mp do this he does it by getting the support of many singaporeans he explains why a government policy is a bad policy or could be improved if the people support him he can speak on their behalf and with many people behind him the government must listen and they have listened before chiam see tong and j.b. jeyaratnam went to parliament we the people had no voice there was no today in parliament ministers did not explain policies to you and me the government just told us what we had to do and fine us if we did not do it they used to force people to cut their hair in the sixties and seventies they used to tell people what sort of t-shirts to wear they told women who work in the civil service not to wear pants or slacks to work there was no consultation and no feedback they never held dialogue sessions with you in the past those were the dark ages now things have changed they know that they must listen to you because if they do not there are opposition mps who will make your voice heard we now have a slightly more open and freer society it is not a gift from the pap it is a necessity you the people of singapore made them change by putting opposition members in parliament we now in the middle ages of our political development but we must come into the modern world we must have a modern political system to match our modern economy we saw what happened in the sixties and seventies when the pap was the only party in power they did not listen and if there is no opposition the pap will not listen to the voice of the old and the sick who cannot afford the new hospital and medical charges over a year ago the pap introduced a hospital privatisation scheme they said we will the hospital more efficient but they did not tell you that they will the hospital more expensive and their efficiency in the pap bible name pay and pay the opposition members of parliament warned that this will be a great burden on the poor and those people who were chronically ill the pap removed nearly all the c class beds now they have discovered that we were right and in today's straits times the pap say that they are prepared to look again at the health policy the old premises and assumptions can be looked at again why should the policy be reexamined again unless it was wrong in the first place let me give you an example a lot of people who passed away many years ago were of people who are dying now in potong pasir a lady came to me she was unable to pay her conservancy charges her husband was dying of bone cancer she herself was sick her daughter and her son-in-law were working at two jobs just to pay the hospital bills and the husband was only a c class patient i asked her about her medisave she said we have no more medisave they cannot pay their bills i am very sad to say i was not able to help her but this is the position of many people in singapore it is very frightening to get sick if you are the sole bread winner the only earner if you fall sick your family can be thrown out into the streets to poverty and if there is no opposition the pap will not listen to the voice of the non-graduate mother whose children do not have priority for registration to the best primary schools isn't it unfair that the children of better-off families whose parents are more able to afford good tuition and give their children a good study environment should also get priority for schools where is the equality do you realise that if he was 6 six years today goh chok tong would not get priority in primary one registration because his mother was not a graduate if mr goh chok tong really believes people-bonding if he really believes that the well-off and the successful must come back and help those who are not so well-off how can he let such an unfair system continue and if there is no opposition the pap will not listen to the voice of the working mother who is paying a high levy for foreign maids so that she can go out and earn that little bit more to make the family's ends meet there are a whole range of issues where we need an opposition in parliament to bring out the issues to question the pap these are matters like independent schools the independent schools are not necessarily a bad thing but should independent schools be allowed to take the best teachers away from the ordinary schools universities we had a 100% increase in university tuition fees recently and they had 3 increases since 1987 you have of course heard of the half tank rule now called the three-quarter rule watch out it will soon be the full-tank rule and higher hdb parking charges 25 dollars to 50 dollars now all of these things i have just mentioned have something in common they all happened after a general election i think it is very strange that when the pap offers to give you back your own cpf money in medisave or medifund they said wait vote for me first i need your mandate then i will give you your money but they never ask you for your mandate when they take money form you this is a real double standard think about it they never ask you for your endorsement when they take money from your pocket i have said that mr chaim see tong that this election is not a general election because it does not affect who will be the government there is no need for the pap to get a mandate to rule they have it already mr goh had admitted this and changed his tactic he now says he wants the people to endorse him he says that he is the issue in this election not medisave medifund edusave but he goh chok tong he says that it is his open consultative style freer more liberal singapore i don't know about you but i think there are still so many rules and regulations binding us all the time i haven't seen much of this more liberal singapore maybe the only thing we have seen are the r movies that's all and even this they are thinking of changing mr goh hints to us other people have hinted to us that if you do not support goh chok tong then the pap are hardliners might oust him in a coup maybe this is why mr goh has changed his campaign slogan in the middle of a campaign he added a little word for stability mr goh chok tong has been watching too much cnn television he thinks he is president gorbachev maybe he thinks bg lee is going to overthrow him what happened in russia is a lesson for us here it shows that the people were not prepared to allow a return to one-party rule there even when they have to look at tanks and armoured cars in their face it was the democratically elected opposition that saved mr gorbachev and the soviet union from his own party hardliners i am talking about boris yeltsin who for many years has been the strongest critic and the strongest opponent of mr gorbachev but it was this critic and opponent who climbed on to the russian tanks condemned the coup and restored democracy to russia not members of mr gorbachev's own party the lesson for us is that you cannot place all your trust in one man whether he is called goh or gorbachev if there is a one-party monopoly his own party might try to stab him in the back but if you have a parliamentary system with a strong and stable opposition you can reduce the chances that hardline clique inside the ruling party whether it is the communist party or the pap reduce the chances that they have to overthrow the system in other words if somebody powerful in the pap intends to stab mr goh in the back do you think there is any pap back-bencher who has the courage to stop the hand that's holding the knife these pap back-benchers although they appear to speak up against government sometimes always follow the party line when the party whip is applied to them yes you think pap mps say amazing things yesterday dr arthur beng said that the pap needs the party whip otherwise it might get toppled by its own back-benchers yah go read the straits times if there is so much chaos don't you think we have a right to know whether there is so much chaos in the pap that they might be toppled by their own back-benchers and who will find out what is going on except your opposition who ask the embarrassing questions of the pap are you having an internal power struggle to which they only reply weak answers and as mr chiam see tong has said mr goh chok tong himself is not above making foolish statements it was reported in today's papers saying that the opposition might win all 40 contested seats and that this will mean that the pap had no mandate and that he would have to step down as prime minister in favour of someone mr goh has forgotten something let me remind him of basic parliamentary factors in the unlikely situation that mr ramasamy's justice party beats him he won't even be an mp and do you know why mr goh chok tong forgot that because he really doesn't believe that he is going to lose he really doesn't believe that the opposition might win 40 seats the reality is that we may that the pap will win many of these 40 seats what the hope is is that the opposition can win some of them this is what we are talking about the system in singapore we are lucky that we have a political system based on a tried and tested model the british western system the system that has been tested over hundreds of years in russia the old guards tried to introduce a new system based on the dominance of one single party this party controls everything from trade union to public transport and health it took them 70 years before they realise that the system did not work and by then the damage was done here in singapore we do not have 70 years one slip by the pap we might be finished unless there is an opposition to check the excesses of government  an opposition to speak up for all people whom the pap does not listen to an opposition to tell the government when and what it is doing wrong and why and finally it is necessary an opposition to stand up in front of tanks to stand up
