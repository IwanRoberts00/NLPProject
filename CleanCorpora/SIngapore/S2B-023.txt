this is where public housing is going in the future sin ming
court bishan west
""
with its distinctive  word  walls and roofs sin
ming court offers one of the latest designs in hdb public housing
""
for the housing and development board it will need upgrading more
than of the six hundred thousand flats all over singapore over the next ten
to fifteen
""
in the 1960s the hdb launched it called its home for the people
scheme
""
today with most singaporeans owning hdb flats housing is no longer
an urgent problem
""
instead many are eager to upgrade into bigger and better flats
""
about half of applications for recently built flats are existing hdb
flat owners
""
to help residents to become comfortable and familiar with their
surroundings to stay put instead of moving out into a new neighbourhood and
community the government's introduced a programme in 1989 to upgrade older
housing estates to about the same standards found in the newer estates
""
the upgrading exercise is one of the most farreaching measures in
public housing
""
sally  word  and her husband ricky moved into
this new estate in hougang from whampoa
""
a distinct feature in the new estate is that a few blocks of
between three and eight are grouped together called a precinct
""
each precinct is marked by artificial boundaries such as link ways
""
this organisation of precincts will be phased into older estates
under the upgrading programme
""
it's designed to give residents privacy and that extra sense of
belonging
""
to ensure wider choices and variety in design private architects
will be invited to take part
""
six precincts have been selected and will be upgraded within the
next two years to show just how the programme can make improvements
""
these demonstration precincts are ang mo kio neighbourhood three
another at the marine parade estate lorong lew lian and telok blangah
""
each will have its own demonstrations with the other show precincts
at clementi and kim keat
""
they spread all over singapore so other hdb owners can easily get
to them
""
in these precincts dialogue sessions have been held since the
concept was introduced
""
towards this end the government works closely with grassroots
leaders and twon council members
""
participation in the project is voluntary
""
the demonstration project is expected to be launched sometime this
year
""
however the majority that is at least seventy-five per cent of
owners in the precinct must be in favour of the proposals before the project
can proceed
""
residents in the each precinct can provide feedback on the type of
changes they want through their grassroots leaders and town council members
""
upgrading of older flats is a new concept in singapore
""
however its been introduced in other countries with a large number
of old buildings
""
the hdb has been studying the upgrading programmes in japan and
france
""
the improved environment as a result of upgrading is expected to
bring about a more cohesive and caring community
""
but how does it work
""
we'll take a look at the new estate of bishan
""
as in many other new estates most people in bishan east come from
older ones all over singapore
""
here they build a new life
""
the focal point of their many recreational activities is the part
in the centre of the precinct
""
all the amenities the playground multi-purpose court and landscape
gardens have been integrated into the park
""
eileen lim moved her home to bishan with her parents four years ago
""
eileen's a student in canada but now on vacation in singapore
""
for eileen there's a feeling of home despite there being about
twenty thousand flats in the estate
""
perhaps the fact that the estate's broken up into smaller areas
helps to build a sense of belonging among residents
""
the open area used in many older estates for parking cars here
becomes a garden
""
the different themes of the estate lend distinction and contrast to
other areas like bishan north identified for its different perspectives
colours and design or bishan west better known as sim ming court
""
come evening the neighbourhood comes alive with its own activities
""
for chandran meeting his children at the playground has almost
become a daily ritual
""
every tuesday night residents meet at the basketball court to get
to know one another better
""
that's aside from the entertainment
""
on other nights they go ballroom dancing or their children practice
tae kwan do
""
like chandran many people feel a growing sense of pride in bishan
""
the upgrading of older estates will give residents greater
opportunity better amenities and a higher standard of living
""
as in bishan it will nurture that sense of pride so that residents
will refrain from littering and vandalising their own property
""
chief architect tony tan and three other hdb architects work for
the upgrading of kim keat lorong lew lian and ang mo kio while the other
three precincts marine parade telok blangah and clementi will be designed by
private architects
""
for all the six precincts the resident gets a package of benefits
""
there are three components in the package
""
within the flat there will be an additional space of about six
square metres
""
it may be a utility space a service balcony at the kitchen or a
front balcony
""
and then conversion of window frames to aluminum type
""
for those who already made changes there'll be improvement work on
the fittings and fixtures such as internal doors or refuse chute hoppers with
self-locking devices
""
the upgrading programme can help flat owners many of whom have
already renovated their flats to improve their surrounding making better use
of common areas such as a surface carpark and void decks
""
in a meeting between the town council the hdb and the architect
with residents of marine parade prime minster goh chok tong he's also an mp
for the marine parade grc said the improved environment is expected to
increase their network of older estates
""
to ensure that the project runs smoothly the hdb launched a pilot
programme early last year
""
the board's to refurbish several big blocks of flats at teban
gardens and woodlands
""
no one will need to move out of his flat during the refurbishing
period which is expected to be about two to two and a half years
""
instead of hacking the existing structure the dry technique and
precost method will be used as much as possible in order to reduce nuisance
level
""
how much one can endure the noise dust discomfort as well as the
safety and security aspects are being carefully monitored and studied by the
hdb
""
feedback from occupants of flats under this pilot programme is
constantly sought in order to help the hdb keep inconveniences to the minimum
""
at the same time visits to newer estates such as pasir ris has been
organised by the hdb in order to make the plan clear to residents in the
demonstration precincts
""
they were shown features that could be incorporated under the
upgrading programme which indeed have already been introduced here
""
in the meantime residents committee members have been actively
carrying out surveys among residents in the identified demonstration
precincts
""
the idea is to ensure that at least seventy-five per cent accept
the proposals of their architect and town councils
""
for those who may find it difficult to join the programme due to
financial constraints there's a loan scheme to help them
""
the cost of upgrading each flat is about forty-five thousand
dollars which includes provision for future fluctuations in material cost and
inflation
""
for the demonstration projects the government will finance ninety
per cent while owners pay only ten per cent
""
public support is vital for the success of the upgrading programme
""
with rising expectations among singaporeans there'll be changes in
lifestyle
""
we spoke to those living in the precincts identified for the
demonstration project
""
the new look that comes with the upgrading programme will be
displayed in special exhibitions to be held at the six demonstration
precincts
""
residents will have opportunities to examine the proposed upgrading
packages for their precincts
""
the hdb will lead in the upgrading exercise of these older estates
""
but it will be the owner flats together with their town councilors
and grassroots leaders to determine their surroundings a singapore transforms
itself into a modern city state

""
""
for the indians gandhi stands as a symbol for many things
""
and among the tenets of gandhi philosophy is the belief that
education is a great leveler in society
""
is a belief that mister isheran  word  would
like to instill in indian singaporeans
""
he spearheads the sinda task force that wants to change the
dropping educational standards among indian singaporeans
""
the challenge that sinda faces is to close the educational gap
between the chinese and indians by the year twenty ten fortunately sinda has
found ready support among in the indian community the president of
""
sinda mister j y pilay told friday background why this is so
necessary
""
some indian singaporeans seem to have lost the drive to excel
""
instead they're satisfied with minimum education and low-paying
jobs
""
this attitude is seen in one particular social strata more than the
others
""
not surprisingly then the performance of indian students is lagging
behind the national average
""
on in four indian students will drop out before getting a psle
certificate
""
only twenty-eight per cent of indian students taking the 'o' levels
qualify for jc
""
among the chinese forty per cent of those taking the 'o' levels
will enter jc and only twenty per cent of indian students taking the 'a'
levels will enter universities or polytechnics
""
the better educated are taking the lead in pulling up the
educational standards of the community
""
less than six months since it began working on this goal sinda has
a number of projects in full swing and the office is a hype of activity
""
mister tegeraj  word  as operations manager has
his hands full making sure everything is running smoothly
""
he works closely with suma the coordinator of the tuition programme
which started in january
""
although they both started here as volunteers their interest in
sinda led to them staying on as full-time staff
""
but sinda can't live on enthusiasm alone
""
they need three point seven five million to run their education
projects
""
now with the amendment to the cpf bill past last week sinda will be
able to collect money through a monthly contribution from all indian
employees
""
employers will automatically deduct employees contributions from
their salaries
""
these are the minimum rates that have been agreed on
""
an opting out scheme for those who don't want to contribute has
been worked out
""
this puts the pressure on giving and it's something which could
lead to negative response among some
""
but mister ishweran who worked on the details of the amended bill
feels that this will not be too much of a problem
""
sinda's latest and most extensive projects so far are these
tuition classes
""
science and maths have been identified as areas of weakness for
many indian students
""
so along with english these subjects are taught three times a week
by qualified teachers using materials from the ministry of education
""
it's only been five weeks but already the effects can be seen
""
in tuition hungry singapore the response has been overwhelming
especially when classes cost only twenty-five dollars per month
""
so far two thousand four hundred students are enrolled in these
classes
""
but by keeping the classes to fifteen students sinda teachers have
been able to give more individual attention to each pupil
""
it's this individual attention that haridas like about sinda's
tuition classes
""
he's not really a bad student but for the last year he's not been
doing well in mathematics
""
now with the extra help he's getting at these tuition classes he
feels that he's improved and that this year's results might be better
""
and if there's no tuition class it's home to a session with mum
""
mrs shanta more than willing to spend her time studying with her
son because she believes very strongly that parents are instrumental in how
well their children do in school 
""
sinda knows that fighting for the future cannot be done without
help from the parents children who learn the importance of education and
knowledge from a young age will be more motivated to do well an through their
parent outreach programme sinda's trying to make sure that this happens with
the formation of groups like sinda the beginning to turn more to community
self-help in order to right what is wrong as those who have succeed reach out
to the less well off in the community perhaps there will come a time when
gandhi's vision may become a reality for these children
