""
alright i shall try very hard to pay heed to pay heed to my
topic which is how to structure dictionary entries for what and la or lah
""
and what my first reaction and it will be a reaction which will be
with me for a long time don't do it
""
it's not possible
""
and it's not uh it's it's almost like a rhetorical question
""
okay i had originally thought of using as a title for my talk he las
las who las best
""
but since i had to include what i've had to forgo that frivolity
perhaps i should change the title of the talk to he las las who las best what
""
 laughs 
""
but i will indulge in a in another frivolity
""
maybe i shall play uh dick lee's song say lah in his latest
orientalism album
""
mainly because i think you've been working really hard at the
workshop uhm run by conducted by susan and you should take two minutes off
just listening to the words of the song
""
there's a handout which should be distributed because the words of
the songs uh of the song uh can be found there
""
we must have also a parallel belief the notion that that system can
be described needs to be described and it's worth describing
""
but how does one go about doing just that
""
foremost  word  only standard and formal
singapore english be codified or should we need to include spoken or
colloquial spoken uh singapore english
""
my focus in this very short presentation i hope will be two
discourse particles lah and what
""
and on the references that i've given out to you you'll find that
there are lots of people who have attempted to describe these particles
""
one to eleven and for number eleven it's another ae done by one of
our students
""
alright we have the problem of definition
""
if you look at that workshop that you've just done
""
if you turn to page eleven for the lexical entry headword lah
""
what can we do to describe this uh discourse particle
""
if you want to have a definition in terms of a linguistic analysis
we can say oh yes definish uh discourse particles
""
well they're also known as communicative particles pragmatic
particles modal particles etcetera and these are not really lexically there
you know
""
they are empty morphemes
""
they add communicative meaning to utterances
""
they modify the meaning of sentences or they express emotive
attitudes of speakers the word
""
speakers is really important because i think that's where our
problem is
""
if we're going to codify this and under language label it will be
colloquial spoken
""
and uh just harking back to dick lee's song singaporeans many of
them speak with a sing-song alright
""
and uh we had a discussion yesterday with anna on tonal and
intonational uh information given in the use of discourse particles
""
well we'll find that the main problem lies with speakers
""
it's not what you say it's what you really mean and it's not how
you say it only how it seems
""
uh i think these words even though they may seem very light lyrical
uh words are words for us to ponder on
""
in terms of discussing this very difficult uh task of entering uh
meanings for this colloquial uh uh spoken form what or lah
""
i think identification is less of a problem
""
the problem would be how these discourse particles are used
differently by different speakers
""
what what do i mean by differently by different speakers
""
we had an invitation
""
i don't know how many of our uh language honours uh supervisors are
here who had the same invitation that i had
""
uh dear dr pakir come lah for what high tea with us lor
""
where ah seminar room as5-03-20
""
when uh second august 1990 thursday
""
time leh 5 to 6:30 pm
""
come hor alright
""
uhm obviously this is an invitation to join the honours class for
tea but they have very uh wittily included this as part of the invitation
""
how many of you received this same invitation as it did
""
you no
""
okay it's made oh you did you did alright
""
okay did this this uh indicates to us that uhm the particle used is
accepted even at tertiary level honours year's students etcetera
""
uhm i didn't really get to uhm you know
""
i i i called one of them up and i said can
""
let's let's match our meanings
""
come lah
""
what do you mean by the lah there and she said it's friendly
persuasion alright
""
for what uh and i said you know
""
i would say what for usually
""
alright why oh high tea with us lor
""
and i learnt this lor with a high rising uh movement because i've
learnt to to do that in the in the most recent uh years that i've been back
in singapore
""
because it's a new particle that's just come in where ah as a
question nasalised
""
i may not have the tone right because i don't speak this particle
from the viewpoint of a chinese uh hokkien speaker or a cantonese speaker
etcetera
""
when ha as a question marker and time leh
""
she says to me uh she said to me uh with the time leh how how do
you say it time leh
""
see i've to learn it
""
i don't know it alright
""
okay time leh   augh  and i said what do you mean by this particle
""
and she said well it it's almost confirmed that you're coming and
you're just asking for the time alright
""
and i said what does what about this one come hor
""
and she had to explain to me how to say it come hor come hor come
hor to indicate some degree of intimacy
""
alright i think among the particles here lah and what as observed
by uh ho mian lian and john platt are the ones that are used by speakers of
english who use english as the dominant language who are higher up the
sociolectal scale
""
the kind of skill they have and therefore should pose no problem
""
but the new particles are the ones that are a problem
""
and obviously if i were to pull off another student they might give
me a little more than just uh a a little different interpretation of some of
these particles
""
alright just a little not too much
""
so the uhm identification is not a problem
""
we can say they're usually not obligatory
""
they do not occur independently as units
""
they are frequently found in sentence-final or phrase-final or
clause-final positions
""
their meanings are tied to intonation and tonicity
""
they're not unifunctional and not uniform in their representation
or meanings
""
for example anna kwan terry discovered that there was a short lah
and a long lah
""
her analysis of it of course she has changed her mind about i think
but generally speaking the short lah would be something like well you might
be going end of this year right ya possibly hopefully if everything is
together lah
""
alright and the long lah would be they're picky right they want
honours grads no lah ya lah
""
alright that's the long lah
""
first we have to under identify the multiple functions served by
lah and what and determine their context of occurrences
""
what does this mean it means
""
we can't just go to the coffee-shop and you know overhear one
conversation jot it down
""
let's have a meaning for this there define it you know
""
there are multiple functions and the context of occurrence would be
a very important factor
""
uhm in fact platt ho platt and ho in world englishes said in a
situation such as singapore where english is used by such a wide spectrum of
speakers
""
from those with minimal to those with very competence and where
ethnically chinese speakers use varying proportions of english mandarin and
the localised southern chinese dialects
""
it would hardly be surprising if there were considerable variations
in the use and functions of the various particles for some speakers
""
they may function as in chinese while for others they may be mainly
the carriers of the pre-pitch movement
""
alright so uhm the the fact that these particles are code-markers
which serve to you know indicate intimacy rapport solidarity and so on would
be accepted quite readily
""
but what other functions
""
wilma marie who has done quite an exhaustive uh list of uh
functions said that for lah you have the function of conveying the
obviousness of something
""
for lah you have the function of conveying a sense of suggestion
""
especially to soften the tone of something which may sound like a
direct command
""
then thirdly you have the function of expla explanation
""
reducing the tone of harshness or hardness in giving explanations
""
she discovered some new functions such as dismissing some
unimportant part of a continuous utterance like whatever lah fifteen sort of
thing lah and all the jazz lah
""
there is also a fifth function of that of deflecting and denying
compliments as in you know
""
if someone compliments you and you say no i was lucky lah uh and
compliments you again not really lah alright if you tell me that this
workshop is enjoyable and i said not really lah uh you have another function
such as conveying a lack of enthusiasm as in chinese new year ah okay lah
""
alright in the work done uh most recently by my ae student chua
siew cheng who did a very exhaustive study of the what particle
""
i think she had two hundred examples gathered from all over
singapore
""
from isetan parkway parade from uh many of the places where you
know spoken discourse can be quickly recorded and then transcribed
""
she had many examples of the use of what uhm in her sample
""
she found that it's normally spoken with a falling tone
""
only 14% of her sample showed that it had a rising tone and that
coincided with the question form use of the words
""
right let me just flip through the overheads quickly so that you
can see what she has done
""
if you can't see it from the back i'll just quickly read it
quickly to you
""
i insisted that uh the context should always be there and the tape
recorded should always be on so that she could find out whether the pretonic
and the tonic was there and she did that
""
and she found that as i said in her data almost every time when
you had objection what you know like very tired lah here can sit don't want
so dirty people also sit what
""
alright people also sit what
""
so that is an objection what
""
now this is an objection what which could also double as an
explanation what in my opinion
""
but she doesn't seem to think that she wants to put that in
""
and she says oh the context is a inquiring where b is attending a
particular lecture
""
'a' you going for lecture ah then must go what
""
alright this is another case in plaza singapura in the lift lobby
""
uh a says but envelopes company got so many envelopes
""
b says application letters cannot use company envelopes what oh ya
""
alright this for her is an explanation what
""
why are you standing here for
""
my wife inside there what
""
my wife inside there what
""
there is another one where one of the salesgirls is displeased
with another colleague and she said so what
""
this is the pejorative one
""
it's found in in utterances that are usually uh overheard on the
university campus here
""
and this is one that was uh quite clearly so you know
""
this peter so what one
""
i ask him to help me with my tutorial and he says your funeral
""
ya he damn what one  laughter 
""
this is the pejorative one and this is another example of
explanation
""
what so expensive this for charity what
""
this is an assertion what 
""
according to her analysis test on wednesday whole book ah die lah
holidays never study never mind lah got two days what
""
another example where it's pretonic and then the falling on the
tonic what i think you can take or you can go down to b2 and you take up
probably singaporean way of kiasu ya that's why ks style what then there is
the persuasion what uh in b is offering a a spoonful of the sundae which b
has just bought and a says i don't eat this lah b says everything you mst try
what everything you must try what and this is the ex persuasion what there is
in her analysis uh comment uh a comment what uh this one blanket this one
quite ok what this one nice what ok then bye it's only a gift i have to rush
through this because we don't have much time now this is uh this will be when
you find that the the tonic the the movement has the pitch movement has
changed when a is asking her friends about their subject preferences major
what econs and what soci major what
""
 laughs  it goes up with the question form this is again
you stay in halls ah got contact number or not why then can contact you lah
contact me for what another question form what with a rising intoning uhm
this is an indefinite what with a rising intonation also today is reebok day
or what and in discussing what to eat a says you want what anything rice
better alright ok i've run out of my transparencies now but you have an idea
of how difficult it is to uhm to describe the functions of what because of
the very many possibilities that can be uh i i guess that are meant by the
particles and it depend very mcuh on whether these particles have their
source their etymological sources in cantonese in hokkien in mandarin or in
some forms of english yearn smith's article indicates that he thinks the what
sh uh what in singapore english has come from the british what in some in
some cases and you can look at his examples if you are interested now there
are issues and problems of course uhm i think the conclusion that has been
made is that the functions of discourse particles in singapore english has
still by no means being fully resolved and we have also to to be very clear
whether these pervasive particles used in spokens uh uh speech of
singaporeans around us reflect uneducated speech or the informality of an
educated speaker what we do recognise of course is that lah and what are are
the ones that appear consisten consistently higher up on the sociolectal
scale as i said uh platt and ho have uh claimed then of course there are
other problems such as the problems well anna brought up yesterday in terms
of lexical tones carried by the chinese and intonation that is uh uh a very
characteristic feature of spoken english everywhere else and in singapore too
alright so it would seem that in addition to their functions of uh semantic
or or functions of communicative and attitudinal uh aspects they have also
they are also carriers in terms of discourse intonation so uhm the problems
remain when we talk about particles we also have to ask questions which platt
asked three years ago or four years ago to what extent do these particles
function as a speech community indicator or as stylistic markers and then are
they uni or multi functional so this would of course be questions we want to
attend to if we want to suggest that lah and what for example deserve a place
in a dictionary that we would produce here now if lah and what and other
discourse particles should merit inclusion in a dictionary for singapore how
should we structure the dictionary entries for such particles uhm i have i
guess i said no at the beginning but i think because of this exercise i have
to do something and i did the sample dictionary entry for what the definition
as found sorry is that for what for lah sorry ok both of them ya ok for lah
let's let's look at uh the sample dictionary entry for lah and i say the
entry is incomplete is dependent upon a large corpus of spoken singapore
english which we do not have at the present time uh if we use the headword la
then we'll have to give the alternative form such as lah or any other forms
that are available i think that's only the alternative form in terms of
spelling then parts of speech it's it's difficult to define it at the moment
i i said you know maybe tentatuvely why don't we just call it a particle we
can call it a modal particle discourse particle pargmatic particle and so on
and the form features you usually find it sentence phrase or clause final but
it's not always so because it's if what for example is used as an objection
marker it can come out uhm uhm at the beginning sentence initial rather than
sentence final let me see if a says oh you only had two biscuits for tea then
b would say something like what two three alright it's an objection uhm then
you have the pronunciation uhm the data from 200 samples here indicate that
it's often with a falling intonation stress and you you put that down but
what do you do with the other cases where you have a rising intonation and
when you have it unstressed etcetra in terms of language label maybe you want
to talk of it as being informal scratch out the other informal or you can ask
whether it is a limited representation of spoken language whether it is uh
educated speakers no speech of english and singap speech of english speakers
in singapore or uhm in the speech found in the spoeech of everyone in
singapore but it has it's uh meaning in terms of whether that the person is
educated or not then definition is impossible at this point because of very
many possible meanings uh the etymology maybe chinese languages found in
singaporte and malaysia and some evidence that it's comes from malay too for
lah usage notes would have to go in there now for what i guess you have to
define what in such a dictionary with the kind of definitions that we use
what the educated english speakers of uh uh the english educated speakers of
singapore use what in the ways that some uh i mean uhm most british speakers
would use what as uh taken from maybe the oxford learner's dictionary the
longmans dictionary collins cobuild etcetra you know interrogative seminar
interrogative pre pronoun and so on but then you would have to have a what
four or what five or what six or what seven which would have to incorporate
all these other meanings that you find here just here in the colloquial
spoken variety definition again is impossible at this point because there are
possible meanings and it carries this function that function depending
whether it is stressed or unstressed whether it is long or short you know
protracted or contracted whether it has a falling intonation or a rising
intonation etcetra but for usage i guess you could say that uhm for example
in what you use what this is the cobuild's approcah you know get a huge
corpus and then list down eleven uses or twelve uses of what you use what one
point one in a retort to convey disapproval or to register objection to a
suggestion or complaint you use what one point two in a retort to convey
annoyance in patients' irritation number three uh onepoint htree in
refenrence to an action or a viewpoint attributed to a third party onepoint
four to share information one point five to show agreement onepoint six to
show up what is oviously so and you can keep on listing all these possible
uses and then you;ll have to say what what functions as you have seen
objections with a chaalenging note expression of obviousness with impatience
and irritation expression of in indignation expression of boldness or
definite opinion etceter etcetra would indicate only individuals whose
solidarity and familiarity are high would use it among themselves and never
at the formal level howevere ofr uneducated speakers of englihs language
fromality concerns do not seem to matter much all sepakers of singapore
english use the what particle in their infomral conversations with friends
and family members thus a feature of informal singapore english in conclusion
i would say that since there are so many problems with discourse particle
analysis in singapore english we amy have to postpone a decision a final
decision as to the kind of animals these are and forgo making a commitment to
the multi multiple functions served by them for example lah and what can
serve as linhuistic in indicators of the singapore malaysian community they
can also serve as linguistic markers where as sociolinguistic variables they
show up stylistic variations then again in another sprial up they amy become
stereotypes which becoming the cause of overcomment may carry stigmatisation
and therefore will drop out of use in time furthermore the pitch and tonicity
problema have not been quite worked out a task requiring a vast amount of the
spoken english vernacular in singapore when these are available and acoustic
and instrumental analysis may help determine the pitch movement and the
tonicity attached to the different meaning carried by the particle so i end
this short presentation by saying i shall withdraw those steps i won't begin
on this task thank you
