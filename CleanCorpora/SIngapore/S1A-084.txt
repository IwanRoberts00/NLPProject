""
""
this is less or this is more
""
""

""

""
""
then use less lah
""
""
less is more
""
""
less time waiting also
""
""
no the thing is i have to put on
""
ok fine
""
""
ah there is lots of seats
""
then i receive from
""
""
here
""
""
not here
""
""
usually go the other
""
""
in front of the building
""
""
we are supposed to
""
""
supposed to what
""
""
never mind
""
""
you speak louder ah
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
why you so when you getting your license
""
ah so when are you getting your license driving license
""
""
my dad says i should get my f t t first
""
yeah so i you know my f t t is on the 15th of july
""
so after that maybe ah but i still can't decide whether i should do
it private or uh school you know
""
""
at the first place why you think that no why you that you you
shouldn't have a driving license since i got driving license
""
""
ok lah
""
it's not easy getting a license
""
ok first and foremost i am so unfamiliar with the roads
""
ok that is first
""
secondly i am quite scared actually to the way you described to me
how to start a car
""
you know it makes me nervous
""
""
even an old granny can drive
""
""
who
""
""
even an old granny can drive
""
""
yeah but then again back to the whether i should take private
or school
""
not very sure lah
""
""
then take private lah
""
""
how much you used to pay
""
eight hundred something right
""
""
eight hundred twenty-five
""
""
that is almost half you know of what you need to pay
""
""
but private you private you get good instructor ah
""
but before you take school school for women will be better
""
""
but it costs a bomb
""
where might i get the money
""
you start working
""
""
yeah maybe because i don't know through my experience private
ah
""
you must have knowledge first
""
then then you can engage the private because they won't
""
""
they wont' start from scratch right
""
""
no
""
""
that is the problem
""
""
they start from scratch but they don't have some sort of like
a book
""
the first day ah
""
lesson one check safety
""
how to check uh your tyre
""
how to sit properly
""
""
i don't need that
""
""
that very important
""
""
that one is not written in the test
""
""
that is tested everything
""
""
during the exam
""
""
ah because
""
""
practical
""
""
because you are driving
""
wah you must know the proper way or where is the okay your mirror
""
""
you mean the private won't teach you that
""
""
maybe just sit down
""
ok ok
""
i teach you ah
""
first gear ah just like that lah
""
""
oh
""
""
if bbdc ah you sit down ah
""
don't go inside the car
""
you walk around the car
""
then he will tell you ok
""
that's what i heard lah
""
to check whether your tyre has punctured or not
""
""
your sister is in the school
""
""
ah ok you sit down
""
your mirror you adjust to what you adjust to where where you can
see
""
so you adjust first until your view lah
""
ah then he check for you
""
everything is okay to drive off
""
first gear then slowly they teach you about metre also like that
like that
""
you have private private teach you all that
""
""
i really need i really need them to start from scratch
""
""
yeah lah of course
""
they will bring you to roads empty roads ah empty roads and all
that
""
""
so where do you think i should take a bbdc or comfort
""
""
bbdc
""
take bbdc
""
bbdc better
""
""
easy to pass right
""
""
easy to pass
""
safer
""
ubi dangerous
""
paya lebar all heavy roads ah
""
then they teach you all the technique lah
""
but you have to go for the class you know if you go to bbdc
""
you take your basic area to pass out
""
""
yeah i also
""
""
finally you successfully pass if you good lah better
""
after you pass you go to bbdc
""
""
ah
""
""
go to bbdc ah you have to take steady class
""
""
still have to take steady class
""
""
ah these steady class these steady class usually forthose
people who haven't take bbdc ever basic and
""
""
so i no need lah
""
""
so you no need to take the basic class
""
just attend the class so you just listen ah
""
""
i don't want to attend any class
""
""
you have to listen
""
you have to attend
""
the book ah you have to chop
""
so every time you just chop chop ah
""
""
oh
""
""
so you just
""
it's ah it's very i've been to all the class before
""
last time bbdc wah
""
then i thought that's why good wah
""
they'll teach you all the uh the thing accident pro ah
""
they say ok the correct way the thing very good
""
they try show you tape
""
ok you see the newspaper the accident
""
then why it happen because it
""
""
really
""
""
yeah lah
""
they teach you very good
""
then you no need pressure you know
""
then if they ask ok those so the lesson you can take while you're
driving
""
ok they give you one month all the schedule
""
you can come to these days these days
""
ok lesson one what day what day
""
""
oh
""
""
ah you can
""
""
ok how much you pay ah
""
you don't have to pay one lump sum right
""
you can pay bit by bit right instalment
""
""
no no instalment
""
""
two times wah
""
you can pay two times or three times
""
""
ok twenty-five
""
twenty-five lessons right
""
you don't book two lessons at a time two lessons at a time
""
at least you book ten lessons at a time
""
""
ok
""
""
so you have twenty-five lessons right
""
so the first time you book ten
""
so the second time you book another ten
""
the third time you book five
""
uh you book three times lah
""
but if you are very confident ok the whole month you book everyday
lah
""
that's why people can get license by one month
""
you book twenty-five days lah ah
""
""
that's why i start working
""
i start working i don't mind
""
""
ok that's why i say you start working then you go and go for
bbdc
""
you put one lump sum
""
ok let's say got first pay ah ok it's fifty-six you know fifty-six
times ten is five sixty ok
""
""
five hundred sixty
""
""
ah you book ten lessons first five hundred sixty
""
then you relax first
""
then half after you learn three lessons or four lessons you book
another ten
""
don't wait until the ten finish you book again
""
you a very long time to wait
""
""
ok
""
""
ah then you book another ten
""
""

""
""
my parents ah

you target yourself about three you target yourself half a
year lah

""
target yourself half a year
""
