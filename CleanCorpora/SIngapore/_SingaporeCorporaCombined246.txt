much obliged my lords my lords if i may take this appeal in the manner in which i have dealt with in my skeletal arguments unless your lordships have should say otherwise my lords and i shall proceed to go through briefly the facts which because of the nature of the arguments which will be raised subsequently they are some of them are material for the purpose of this appeal my lords this appeal arises from a decision of chan sek keong judge?? be it on the twenty-sixth day of july nineteen eighty-nine ordering the petition filed herein by the appellants in his company's winding up petition number seventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine on the seventh day of march nineteen eighty-nine he struck out and the action dismissed on the grounds that the petition and/or the proceedings instituted by the appellants thereunder constitute an abuse of the process of court two the cause of this application herein detects and paid by the appellants to the respondents and the company now in so far as the facts which are material to this appeal are concerned my lords my lords may i be permitted to proceed with paragraph two the appellants are members and minority shareholders of chong lee leong seng company private limited herein after referred to as company and on the seventh of march nineteen eighty-nine instituted proceedings under the company's act chapter fifty in company's winding up petition number seventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine to seek relieve under section two hundred and sixteen of the act against certain of his directors on the grounds that the latter a had conducted the affairs of the company in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company including the appellants and/or in this regard of the appellant's interest as a member of the company and/or b who are exercising their powers as directors of the company in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company including the appellants and/or in disregard of the appellant's interest as members of the company and/or c had acted and are then or are threatening to act in a manner which unfairly discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the appellants as members of the company the principle relieve served by the appellants was for the company to be wound up by the court under the provisions of the company's act with other relieves prayed for my lords pausing here for a moment if i may just refer your lordships to the petition itself just to page twenty-seven of the record my lords which sets out the relieve sought by the appellants in their petition page twenty-seven of the record have your lordships got that page now your lordships will note preceding the prayer for relieve there is a statement my lord in that paragraph beginning with in the circumstances and i read my lord in the circumstances the petitioners have been advised that it is just an equitable that the company be wound up and then the prayers go on in prayer a one sorry my lord that chong lee leong seng may be wound up by the court under the provisions of the company's act so my lord what i wish to stress at this point in time is that the relieve sought if i may expand on that my lord are one a winding up under the just an equitable rule which is under section two hundred and fifty-four my lords of the company's act two hundred and fifty-four my lords if i may refer you at page three hundred and forty-eight of the singapore statutes chapter fifty now i would like to draw your lordship's attention to two provisions in that section section two hundred and fifty four point one reads the court may order the winding up if and then we go on to f the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interest rather than in the interest of the members as a whole or in any other manner whatever which appears to be unjust unfair or unjust to other members and under i the court is of the opinion that it is just an equitable that the company be wound up so that my lords this section two hundred and fifty-four comes under the division of the company's act relating to the winding up by the court and i intend to later develop the argument that in the case of oppression so to speak my lords the petitioner or the oppress minority so to speak may have availability to wind up under section two hundred and fifty-four or two hundred and sixteen and the nature of my arguments will be that two hundred and sixteen provides for an additional ground for winding up and that has been confirmed my lords by the learned judge in his judgment itself but suffice it to say my lords at this point in time it is pertinent to point out indeed two revealing sections in the companies act relating to winding-up so to speak in respect of acts committed by officers of the companies and in which relief is being sought by a shareholder generally called the oppressed shareholder my lords my lords the petition was presented on the seventeenth of march nineteen eighty-nine under the provisions of the companies winding-up rules nineteen sixty-nine and in accordance with rule twenty-three thereof the registrar appointed twenty-first april eight-nine as the date on which the petition was to be heard the petition was thereupon served on the company on the twentieth of march eighty-nine and the persons named therein as the respondents that is the directors of the company now my lords this date twentieth march is significant because of the arguments which will later be developed on the question of whether there was any waiver of the irregularity if any now on the seventh of april nineteen eighty-nine the petition was advertised as required by rule twenty-four of the nineteen sixty-nine rules on the eighth of april and tenth of april nineteen eighty-nine a total of four affidavits were filed on behalf of the company in opposition to the relief sought under the petition so after the appearance of the advertisement four affidavits were filed by the respondents by the company on the tenth of april nineteen eighty-nine the company through their solicitors applied for and were granted a validation order under the provisions of section two hundred and fifty-nine of the companies act that is under the winding-up division inter alia that payments made by the company and on its behalf including payments out of the company's bank accounts and all other transactions and dispositions of property by and on behalf of the company and in the ordinary course of business up to and including the date on which the petition is disposed of shall not be avoided by virtue of the provisions of section two hundred and fifty-nine of the companies act however before the petition could be heard on the twenty-first of april nineteen eighty-nine the company on the fourteenth of april that is after having filed the four affidavits in reply in opposition to the petition and after having applied for the validation order on the thirteenth of april then applied for an order under order eighteen rule nineteen of the rules of the supreme court and my lords this is where the second part the record of appeal which we have tendered in that sets out the summons-in-chambers and it would be i think necessary to just look at the summons-in-chambers and see what precisely was the relief sought by the respondents this is at record of appeal bundle two summons-in-chambers the applicants prayed for the following orders one that the time for service of this application be reached two that pursuant to order eighteen rule nineteen point one and/or the inherent jurisdiction of this honourable court the petition herein is struck off and the action be dismissed on the grounds that the petition and/or the proceedings instituted by the petitioners there under constitute an abuse of the process of court if i may just digress for a moment my lords what they are saying is because the petitioners had instituted the proceedings in the way they did that act of commencement under the winding-up rules constituted an abuse of the process of court and it was on that ground and no other that the summons-in-chambers to strike out was filed and upon which the order was subsequently made by the learned judge three that pursuant to his inherent jurisdiction this honourable court may make such orders as it deems fit for the purpose of remedying the consequences of the said abuse again my lords the whole tenor of the application was abuse of the process of court and of course prayer four that summons my lords is a question the prayer for costs which we need not deal with my lords as we understand it if i may resume with paragraph eight of my skeletal arguments the main ground for the allegation of abuse of process is that proceedings for any relief from oppression must be commenced under order eighty-eight of the r s c and not under the winding-up rules and therefore ought to be struck off under order eighteen rule nineteen or under order ninety-two rule four of the r s c that is basically the main attack my lords of the procedure adopted by the appellants that it must be commenced under order eighty-eight the application was heard by chan sek keong justice in chambers on the twenty-first of april eighty-nine that was day on which it was assigned by the registrar my lords to hear the petition itself and by way of a reserved judgment dated twenty-sixth july nineteen eighty-nine chan sek keong justice ordered the petition to be struck out on the ground that it was improperly presented as a winding-up petition under the companies winding-up rules sixty-nine since he was of the view that the proceedings ought to have been properly commenced by way of a petition pursuant to the provisions of order eighty-eight of the rules of the supreme court nineteen seventy and if i may just at this point of time conveniently refer to order eighty-eight my lords it's at page two hundred and ninety-five of the r s c and that order is entitled the companies act nineteen sixty-seven which is our present chapter fifty my lords now if your lordships were to look at rule five the following page the following applications under the act must be made by petition and this rule my lords prescribe the mode of commencement of the various actions under the companies act namely applications and we are only concerned with h my lords under section one hundred and eighty-one of the act for relief in cases of oppression the section one hundred and eighty-one mentioned therein is now section two hundred and sixteen of our revised statutes my lords of the companies act so my lords what rule five of order eighty-eight prescribes is the mode of commencement and if i may just this may be basic but i think it's needed to stress at this point in time my lords that there are only four modes of commencing proceedings in the high court in singapore namely the writ of summons originating summons petition and originating motion only four modes in which to commence originating process in the high court and rule five prescribes that an action for relief under section one hundred and eighty-six must be commenced by petition so that my lords if for instance an oppressed shareholder decides to commence by way of a writ of summons then of course he would have used the wrong mode for commencement and that mode would be totally one which is contrary to order eighty-eight rule five h  and it is necessary my lords to stress at this point of time this argument because as i develop my arguments further my lords what the respondents did in this case was also to commence the action by way of a petition under the winding-up rules so the mode of commencement is important what order eighty-eight prescribes is the mode of commencement
