hello hi are you asleep yet hi naw going to a little bit more i would have knocked off okay are you i can is she being recorded now okay ya you're being recorded already whoa being recorded uh okay ya okay so you have to start telling me all about what you've been doing during your holidays oh ya i've got to start telling you what i've been doing during this holidays uh not very many days are there  sighs  no you mean when kim tok went away uh uh holidays began already what kim tok went away on saturday night ya ya so they were on holiday already right oh yes ya actually they were on holiday so far actually what what did we do to them uh but did he take leave no he didn't oh i see but what he did was that you know he stayed back in the morning like worked here two hours while i went to do my driving i told you i took my test failed you know ya that's right that's right so the last week everyday i was out on the road oh i see i see so you mean you had like intensive training during the ya i had i had a full four days or five days prior to that lah oh and then there were no baby-sitters because all the all the navigators staff girls were in camps in church camps and the navigators camp and teen navteens camp you know  word camps you know oh oh ya that's right so i told him please lah just stay back and nuh just keep an eye on the kids and work here ya that's right ya actually they're alright you know ah just need somebody to keep an eye you see that's right so he worked here and then he went to the office so let's see uh but he took one morning off to bring them to the beach uh to catch crabs uh oh ya lah that's right ya so but then before that how did you do your driving oh i've word twice a week only you know oh then how did you do it when uhm oh word benjamin is in school oh i see i see uh ya so you had to arrange it lah ya so i don't have to arrange it because benjamin goes to school so i timed it such that uh i will come back in time to make lunch for him you see ya he comes back by twelve so that means the instructor will come and pick you uh no no no i go to the driving school to uh i word  driving from driving school oh i see and then they'll take you on the course ah then they take me on the course lah oh i see ah then it's a one-hour forty minutes deal uhm so hundred minutes so i'll take a bus to the driving school that's about twenty twenty-five minutes and then uh where is that bukit batok you know near julie's house oh so it's alright lah ya very near uhm uhm so i'll come back by the time when i come back it's time to get lunch ready and then benjamin will be home lah that is the reason oh i see but it it costs a lot nuh huh cost a lot uh does it ya i'm sure ah ya anyway ya that's right because like now the whole thing i think you know it's so costly thousand over you know ya thousand over so if you have to take it again no need lah actually see the school is uh one thing that's good about them uh uhm what they do is that they bring you uh for the circuit and then uh it's about how many lessons uh i was i was a bit slow lah uhm uhm you know i think the younger drivers they learn it for about half far far faster than me oh i see so you mean it's all in whether you take it again or not and all that no actually it's up to me the base cost is the same uh no no it's up to me you see uhm uhm for example i took about thirty two lessons with them you know uhm uhm uhm so but out of thirty two lessons uh fourteen lessons uh uhm uh fourteen or sixteen i think half of it or more than half were on the circuit you know oh i see that means they teach you do all those parking lah all those  word  ya which is the essential lah ah uh huh ya and then uhm the second uh half of it nuh was on the road oh i see so after that you see at the at different stages they pass you you know uhm uhm uhm you must pass the fourth stage uh uhm must get less than thirty points before they allow you to go to the fifth stage you see oh i see then when you finish the fifth stage uh you're supposed to get less than twenty points before they allow you to sit for the test you know so you never had to go on the road lah no i went on the road oh you did i did you know so that means you did pass all the stages i passed all the stages aiyoh so right now uh when i sat for the exams uh ah ah they thought that i should be able to make it lah fifty percent lah ah ah ah ah you know as good as that i see i see so now that i fail ah i can just go back to school and take one lesson you see oh just the minimum of one only i see i see no but what i mean is that when you go through the test suh uh huh you have to start all over again yes yes oh i see no lah but i think you shouldn't take just one you should take more than one because it's a matter of practice but you know it's so costly you know i know but then the thing is that driving is practice you see just more time uh ya it's just practice it's not because you see even if you pass uh by chance uh uh huh then after that you're not that confident driving on the road too you you still it's a matter of practice it's true you know ya so that's why actually you might as well put in that effort and then get it through you know ya rather than because if you keep delaying it also that's true ya because when can you take the next test august my next test is in august oh so between then and now i mean you you need at least to drive a couple of times a month i do need uh ya i do need so what i was planning to do lah i thought what i'll do is that since i have learnt the basic skills from them uh uhm uhm i use the same skills and go to a private one that's half the cost you see ya ya i see you know that means what i need is i i just need confidence on the road yes yes that's right that's right you know the circuit is no problem ah ya i didn't even get a single point in the circuit ya you know i mean i it was okay you see ya ya that's right parking was no problem even ya so i just need that confidence uh half hour oh you mean this one you go the one you go to is actually ran by the government it's not a private one it's a private one you know oh same lah but it's a big private company oh i see but uh they don't allow you to take more than two times a week you know oh so when you book with them uh you only got maximum of two times a week to take you know oh i see so the private one it means it's cheaper is it uh the the private one is cheaper private means individuals lah i mean those uh you know that you used to learn from you see ah ya lah that's right whereas the school lah they already had a system lah you know they have already worked a system as to how ya you should drive how word you should see it oh ya what you should notice lah i mean they almost like basically train and instruct you ya it's quite professional lah ya quite professional you see uhm uhm uhm but i think one of the disadvantage i find when i uhm i took a private one for about four times lah ya just to ride drive you know and see what's the difference you know uhm i think in terms of uh skills and technicalities uh uhm the school is superb lah ya that's right they're they're really superb on that ya uhm but the problem is because they're so trained to teach you they don't give you a chance uh to think you know uhm uhm to decide for yourself you see ya that's right so when i drove on the road with this uh private one uhm it was very good i mean i i i applied what i learnt uhm he didn't say anything he just let me drive uhm in fact they were so confident i'll pass all of them i think god just doesn't want me to kill anybody on the road or just kill myself kill my children whatever ya you know no i think it's basically uhm ya just more practice that kind of thing and you have i mean the confidence is also gained through driving it often enough that's right lah ya i don't think i've got it often enough that's right so you probably just go to the private one and get it you know a couple of times a week ah word so i've to just to keep up the momentum ah i mean it's far cheaper anyway i mean it's about uh well how much twenty over dollars uh twenty over for uh one and a half hour session you see whereas the school is about forty eight you know that's over twice ya terrible uh when i was learning it i was like paying the most expensive school lah lambert's last time uh word  oh lambert's uh how much was it ya eight fifty ya i know per hour that kind of thing in fact somebody was telling they only learned it for five dollars you know ya but that was ages ago lah ya probably kim tok's was free free ya because he told me how did he learn driving uhm  word malaysia i think what he did was that uh he drove around you see ya that's right so came back here he took a a driving licence and passed you know ya ya that's right because he's confident on the road you see that's why i remember some people who ride motorbikes and all uh uh after they uhm you know they want to go to get their licence uh ya they they learn it very fast because you kind of have a bit more road-sense already oh ya that's why so i think i'll i'll press on uh because i don't think i want to give up the only thing is that whoa ya no you shouldn't i mean after that all that money you spent on it already no thousand over dollars now you know ya that's right ya so   word  it's a matter of just you know keeping it up  word  it's only a pp uh that you know private cars you can't drive huh otherwise it's you know it's a matter of practicing that's all it's true you know ya it's true ya but anyway i anyway that morning when i was doing my quiet time uh word  uhm i mean the lord gave a verse of psalms forty two 42 says 'by day he will direct his love at night he he gives me a song' uhm and i thought it was quite good because uh you know the the meaning of the the fact that he directed my his his love towards me uh uhm by allowing me to fail was quite encouraging you know uhm then after i sent kim tok off to the airport it's so funny i was i didn't realize how tired i was i was so geared up for the whole week for this test suh ya that suddenly when when uh i i went to the airport after the whole thing was over they told me i failed it was very nice you know uhm this that this instructor was saying 'oh no uh we regret we can't give you you know' uhm this time i'm i'm sorry and i got thirty one uhm i felt so relieved then but i went to the airport i was so tired and sleepy uhm sending him off i went to buy uh duck duck rice from the shop uh uh then this man gave me back my change you know ten dollars uhm give me four dollars and i was looking at the money i wasn't actually looking uhm i was looking and not looking you see ya and he thought that i was questioning his integrity he said 'uh isn't it right isn't it right ' i said 'no no no ya it's right i'm not looking at the money i'm not thinking i'm just tired you know' and then he told me say 'i teach you how to do some exercises these are chinese martial art exercises' he word  oh he really did uh yes he's so sweet you know he said some he gave me a name of the what he said 'i i practise this and it's very good you know help to revitalize your your your zeng san uh uhm they call zeng san you know ah ah ah so i say 'oh' so i told him 'no lah no lah anyway uhm i'm so tired because i just failed my driving test lah' uh you know i just came and sent my husband off but i failed my driving test uh so he says 'how many times already ' i said 'first time' 'aiyah first time no problem very few people pass first try' ya that's right i passed my fifth time okay 'a' but good lah you pressed on ya and then this tun tun passed first time because he quarelled with the instructor or rather after that he told the instructor 'come on' he argued and then he got through because  word  you know last time it's not so scientific you know oh it's not point system right oh ya ya ya it's more a bit more judgemental so he argued argued argued and he came back he passed no but now they're quite strict you know they're quite fierce about it you know ya that's right now it's more scientific you see ya so it's more difficult in fact they don't put any ar arguments and things like that you know word  ya that's right
