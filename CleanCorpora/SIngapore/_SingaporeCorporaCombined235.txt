okay welcome to all of you ah today i will exaggerate more on the pc side because now pc ah become more and more popular so of course word and we hope in singapore ah have a pc right so we will consider more of this so introduction to the computer okay now to a computer i can see here this is computer right so this is not black box is a white box now for all those laymen not technical incline actually it's just a magic black box you put something in and something will come out right you you press one key the picture will come out see i i press a key here then another picture will come out right it look very impressive word just like magicians okay so actually computer ah break down convert round the cpu that's the most important thing that is comparable to our brain so so that is computer brain it's a cpu and maybe consist of what you call alu is arithmetic and logic unit that means it can do arithmetics and it can do some low level logically word logical decision-making okay then word controller controller just like a traffic-controller so if you want to read something from somewhere the controller will advise the computer what to do so if you want to read from floppy-disk it will read from floppy-disk if you want to write to something some device it will write to some other device whenever to show onto the screen it will show on the screen so controller will do all the controlling now then the computer need what you call memory so when you go and buy a computer for example if you ask how much memory you have right so the basic configuration for example for eighty and 386 machine for example the basic one will come up with about six hundred forty k but some will come with one meg or even two meg or four meg but whatever increase in the memory you'll have to pay for it it's not free right now so we've the internal memory the function of the controller is to retrive and store data  word from the storing devise by storage devise for example here this one we have quite a number of storage devises inside here we got hard disk in here we have a floppy-disk in here so this is a storage devise so the controller will control all these things and it will communicate between input and output devise so this one is output devise these two the keyboard and the mouse is input device okay so it will control all the these function and it will communicate between the alu and memory for example computer need to do some calculations they need information the information is stored in the memory so the job of coordinating all these effort is done by alu and controller okay then you can execute instructions written in a programme so computer will do a very fantastic job but one at a time now computer unlike human being word  my personal opinion computer can never replace human being because no doubt we talk about computer intelligent artificial intelligent but actually all those intelligent are human intelligent human put into the programmes so they become process of certain degree of intelligent but it's all from human so without man the computer cannot work right then the control of operation of alu do all the arithmetic function do logi logical decision-making so the function of ale occurs as the name imply it do arithmetic operations it perform logical operation for example by logical operation means what suppose you are calculating say sales commission for example so if you make monthly sales below five thousand no sales commission so it's zero right so your commission will be zero but if you make monthly sales between five thousand to ten thousand commission will be 2% of the total sales for example then if your sales is for ten thousand to twenty commission will be 4% and so on so the computer can make some logical decision-making so suppose it make the sales for certain sales executive now it will know how to calculate the sales commission if the sales' below five thousand the commission for that month will be zero okay if the sales is between five thousand and ten thousand computer are smart enough they will take the total number of sales times 2% and then add this one to your commission and so on so that is what you call logic operations then the memory sometime you call this memory right so you if there is time the computer programmes and then now  word it store now computer actually is just a tool of course it's more uh what you call attractive and also more what should be more flexible than just a knife for example but in terms of utility it's just like a tool okay computer is a tool to help us to carry out our job more efficiently in a more productive way so computer is a tool now how can a computer work without cannot work suppose computer you buy a computer and you pay for say for example two thousand for a computer you take it home you turn it on you'll word not going to work because like if you don't pay for the software it doesn't work it's just mere piece of hardware sit there and computer have a lot of patience if you don't tell the computer to do the cursor just hang on on the screen that's all and it keep waiting to receive your instruction before you make the first move so all the computer do it so fantastic right is because of software now you watch for what you call science fictions programme lah i mean in tv right so certain agent want to know other agent's information press one button all biodatas everything come out right now the computer cannot do that all that is done by software and also done by human being that means in order to get all those information you must have the information first so you may send twenty agents to get all the information then you need another number of peoples okay to key in all those information and you need to have a software to retrieve all information and show it on the screen to you right so all these software programmes are stored in the memory now computer need to communicate with outside peripherals for example you have input device for example the standard input device is what you call keyboard okay and we have a mouse like that and nowadays you have a new one call n system now if you don't want to key in you can just write you'll  word understand what you write okay so that is input device then you have some output devices this one is output device it's a standard one word so whatever you want to read come to here another device for example printer you can print it out we'll cover the devices so all these function will go through the cpu cpu will do all the job right print something you want okay just like your mother wants to cook certain dishes go to the market to buy all the ingredients so ingredient is the input side and ingredient put in the input device then the cpu that means already get the instruction how to cook say for example sweet and sour pork for example so with all our ingredient prepare then every single step will work to carry out to cook sweet and sour pork word right so output device will store your what dish we have some auxillary storage for example you may have some other thick word  drive you may have for example okay multi-media you may have cd-rom everything you can  word to have all these all went through the cpu now computer is a tool so what are the major characteristic of the computer high-speed for example take for example you want to look for some information which  word on file then you see manually you go to the cabinet look for the file keep flipping you still could find the information right right for computer system if you have a good database all i need to do is key in the key words press a button you will immediately give off the information from the devise okay so for example nowaday you have an encyclopedia all on cd-rom so you can check all the reference ah articles by keying some of the key-words you can immediately get the information out whereas for manual system you have all volumes of encyclopedia that now you must know which volume to take out then you have to go to the index to check which page to look  word from now computer can do this in much much higher speed okay then it can systematically store and retrieve vast volume of datas for example the bank auto-teller right you just if you put your card into the ah auto-teller machine right then you just key in your what pin-number and then you key in what you want to get out all these in a few seconds' time you can get your money from the bank already right why because the bank already systematically store the information in there now how much you've balance in there so suppose you have only five hundred inside you key in eight hundred it just simply say you have you have insufficient fund right please take back your card suppose word  all the information is there so you can systematically store and retrieve randomly all the information you can automatically execute instruction now the first generation of computer is very terrible it's all hard wire so they have to wire up wire up right to do one operation they have to re-wire change another operation they have to re-wire all over again so make that make the computer very unfriendly very hard to use only those very few technical people know how to operate computers okay but now the computer today is totally different it's very friendly all you need to do is just to the programme in store on any device then it can read from the device go into the memory and it just carry out the instruction from the main menu so it automatically carry out then it'll process logical capability i already explain to you and it is accurate computer unless a computer go haywire okay it is more accurate than you can expect for example the computer will store up to fourteen decimals in there okay right as you've seen calculators sometime you have to do some rounding and so if you have so many intermediate step the end result maybe  word rounding will cause you the first digit right difference okay but computer is maintain full accuracy up to fourteen digit inside and is reliable reliability if the programme of course if the programme is wrong then of course you couldn't rely on the computer to give you the result but if the programme is correct the logic is correct then you key in the information it can always reproduce it can reproduce the same result over and over again so ten persons key in the same thing running the same programme will get the same result you won't get different result okay so that is reliable so how does computer solve the problem as we mentioned in software right so for the computer software mainly is in two area one is system software the other one is what you call application software now system software consist of control programme and service programme now control programme will do all the necessary complication between all the devices and between the memory so if you want to open a data file say my grandparents they will go to the appropriate device read the file out okay so all these is done by control programme  all the input output side then you have some call service programme now every now and then you need to copy file you need to backup file for example you need to do purge purge all the file all these is come uh under what you call service programme right
