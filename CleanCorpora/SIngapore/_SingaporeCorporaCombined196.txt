and a very warm welcome to you to the toa payoh sports complex for the start of the fourth day of swimming events here at the seventh south-east uh uh the seventeenth south-east asia games uh where the word of prime minister mister goh chok tong to watch the uh events which everybody is waiting for the fifty metres freestyle for men and we have introduction of swimmers here in lane number five is richard sambera of indonesia lane number six is chakasay of thailand lane seven we harold gan and in lane number eight raymond papha ang peng siong exceeded uh the best swimmer in this uh heats this morning he is in lane number four and he should be expecting a good fight from lane three wisneil of indonesia on his left and uh peng siong has shaven his head for this event this is gonna be a very interesting race and off to a very very good start and uh peng siong right in the lead all the way the twenty-five metre mark that's chia peng siong followed by richard sambera and uh and the top of the cream is uh singapore harold gan out to word and it's peng siong yes that's peng siong in the lead in a time of twenty-three point six seven seconds in second position we have richard sanbera at twenty-three point seven three and third position went to uh wisneil of indonesia in twenty-four seconds it is a frustrating race here by uh peng siong whose time of twenty-three point six seconds although has word not broken his previous record is still good enough for the gold medal and that's peng siong with his shaven head winning the gold medal the only events that he's swimming and he has won the gold medal and look at how happy he is with his shaven head ang peng siong the old man of swimming here with a round of applause from our prime minister and also defence min minister doctor yeo ning hong and the president of the singapore amateur swimming association victor goh yong hong and there you have the official result lane number four was ang peng siong in twenty-three point six seven seconds in second position is lane number five richard sambera of indonesia twenty-three point seven three in third position lane number three uh wisneil of indonesia in twenty-four seconds flat and let's watch the replay here yes it was a very close race but uh actually toto in a race like this you really don't really bother about strategy you just go in and if you notice i don't think any of the swimmers took a breath at all throughout the whole race uh they just took a deep breathe at the start and if at all maybe a breath uh halfway down but i don't think any of the swimmers ever took a breath right through well this is a a typical ang peng siong race uh peng siong always starts off very very strong and uh towards the end uh he he probably just uh coast word and uh another five more metres i think uh richard would have uh beaten peng siong but nevertheless yes that's not a fifty-five metre race and that's peng siong this is why peng siong doesn't want to swim the hundred metres because he knows that uh he just doesn't have the uh stamina to carry out this uh uh uh hundred metre race but fifty metres is still very good for him and uh with that we'll cross over for the last five minutes of the hockey game uhm and we'll come back to the toa payoh swimming complex later on  and this the introduction of the swimmers for the two hundred metres breath stroke the second event this evening we've just introduced joselin yeo in lane number one and in lane number two we have sita of thailand now joscelin uh qualified seventh in in the heats this morning that's why she's in lane number one and uh i don't know uh what her strategy is and i hope uh she should win another medal for singapore nevertheless that's an introduction there and lane number five we have duyuen ti pong uh followed by the second duyuen ti pong from vietnam and this is lane number six buwicks buwickshit of thailand in lane number six and that's may ooi of singapore in lane number seven and in lane number eight we have rita mariani of indonesia now although joscelin is in lane number one she will be at the bottom of your screen uh watch out for her because uh we really don't know anything can happen it's the uh one of the slower lanes on the outside but uh well there's four lengths of the pool to go and uh we're expected something from joscelin over to you toto i don't know it's really fabulous uh the effort by joscelin but i wondering while you were giving the commentary let me add the qualifying times uh from the heats this morning you know joscelin almost didn't make it she qualified seventh like i said her time during the heats this morning was two minutes fifty-three point three one and rita mariani qualified last with two minutes fifty-three point six one if joscelin had just slowed down uh by a tenth or two-tenth of a second she would have been out of the finals but uh nevertheless uh joscelin swimming in lane number one winning her sixth gold medal i think it's may ooi uh in sorry it's it's rita mariani in third place rita mariani in third place uhm there's joscelin in lane number one she's extremely strong last five metres as she lunges towards the wall and it's a new record time by the way two minutes thirty-four point eight seven seconds and uh toto this is a typical commentator's nightmare when you have swimmers so far apart coming in so close together right it's very hard for us to spot them and to call them out but nevertheless uh uh the important thing is joscelin has won and what a night it is for singapore the first two event and we've got two goals already tonight first by ang peng siong second by joscelin yeo and uh we are gonna have a replay now of the last hundred yes that's uh one fifteen point six one in the first hundred metres by joscelin you know toto we've got great swimmers uh all these years but nothing nobody has come close to joscelin because she's really an all-rounded you know she swims all the strokes very very well uh we were talking about junie sng junie was very good in in the front corner word of free-style she was good in the butterfly but uh and and that was it but uh look look uh look at this uh even pat chan in those days pat was a a very good uh free stylist but i don't think pat uh maybe where if she hears us at the studio well she she fancied swim that breast stroke because it's it's not an easy event to swim and here you have a truly all-rounded uh joscelin yeo she swims every uh stroke just as well and coming in towards the last five metres of this replay she wins the two hundred metres breast stroke for women and there you have the results and uh let's hear from our sponsors and once again another penalty corner this time conceded by florence as she obstructed the indonesian danger girl johanna with just over ten minutes left singapore still lead by that solitary goal scored just before half-time by delima isa but that goal is under pressure now from the indonesians it wasn't a clean stop and number eleven of singapore ong kim choo managed to clear the ball away that was the third time she's broken up a a indonesian short corner here's johanna dina trying to squeeze her way through she manages to win a long corner that wall was lifted into the dee florence good play by florence she didn't actually make contact with the ball but she forced dina into playing a bad pass hit out by florence once again she's looking into clear range she couldn't the stick johanna was actually obstructing her that ball lifted into the dee so that should be a sixteen yard hit for singapore and they would be well-advised to take their time on this one she finds dahlia dahlia will send it long to melanie was trying to get free but indonesian they pick her up well siew keng well stopped by siew keng she found geraldine who tried to flick it to melanie siew keng once again they're still trying to play up melanie the the indonesian girls packed the dee right there and singapore wasn't able to find the way through well cut out by dawn defol that allows the singapore girls time to get back but i can see a few tired women out there there's not much help from the frontline coming back to assist the mid-field geraldine played in to dahlia and held word it up given it melanie melanie is trying to free delima the ball has foul word its way through swee keng short ball to delima delima's round her man or a woman i should looking for a good cross well cut-out by the indonesians a chance there the ball didn't run right for dahlia very good run by delima that cross caused quite a bit of panic and confusion in the indonesian defence the ball did right run right for dahli though and swee keng melanie  word  well played by the goalkeeper geraldine another chance and somehow the indonesians managed to scramble that one way well read by dawn played forward word to melanie dahlia trying to free geraldine inside the dee there was obstruction so we're gonna see another short corner here for singapore and there's geraldine ho the player who won the shot donna is now going to play the ball back dahlia is set to stop it let's see what singapore have up their sleeve this time a bit over elaborate there the indonesian girls were off the line quickly and singapore have lost the chance to pair that one goal advantage long ball played out here geraldine she stopped it well and this time i see dahlia doing her best to get into the box but geraldine's reverse flick did make contact ball still with singapore though that looks like obstruction yes it was it's obstruction oh that was a very poor ball easily cut out by word  with just about five minutes left and the score is still singapore one indonesia nil both sides have their chances in this second half but neither has been able to score so the solitary goal scored just before half time by dalima hither still word the difference these two teams ball played to melanie martin and singapore has a chance that ball was a bit too soft by melanie well played by geraldine she went a long way back there but she was dispossess lifting the ball into the dee the indonesians have been let down by that particular infringement on many occasions they've had a lot of possession but that final pass has been called lifted into the dee on many occasions melanie good cut back she overran in not having one of her best games melanie martin's with her skill and class nobody doubts there's still just under five minutes well played by swee keng but i think singapore were very very lucky there  one of the girls seem to me had almost trap the ball with her body that could easily have been a penalty stroke but the umpire has given the short corner well charged down so that should be a long corner and singapore singapore breaking out and we are just gonna cut away to give the give you back to the studio who's gonna show you the victory ceremony for ang peng siong
