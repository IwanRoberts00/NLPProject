good afternoon ah my name is iris ching and and i'm the software consultants welcome you to our this easy asset ii and easy cash seminar so uh before i explain into our package of uh computerising the fixed asset which is the first session of the seminar and the second session will be on easy cash which is the general ledger package plus the cash management system session i will like to briefly explain ah what actually how you can successfully use our package to computerise your system okay uh our system runs mainly all on pc-base and uh you could use a ibm compatible pc or running on an ms-dos system which can be running on version five or below and uh it goes on an unlimited databased system okay now if you are looking into uh how many of you are actually looking into a g/l package over here yourself is it and uh what kind of g/l package you are looking into a multiuser or a single-user single-user so it's no problem because our system runs on a single-user basis and it has this ah multi passwords whereby you will give you this security purposes and uh what about yourself eileen not at the moment ya i have seen ah in word and you are also looking into fixed asset system you are looking into that ah okay this easy asset ii is a new upgrade or we call it a new release version for this year previously we know it's known as easy asset and the package for this one compared to the old version there's a difference is this one goes unlimited database the other version is limit up to a thousand five of records it can enter now this one goes unlimited so you don't have to worry about the easy asset ii if you have number on or you call the volume of assets increasing per year then you will not have this problem of you know up to a certain limit you cannot carry on your system so okay let me run down this system for you so that you could understand better of the features and also the operations of it now as you can see this is the introduction whereby it tells you that this package is developed by our own company and it's developed in singapore okay specially for the singapore office but we also cater for oversea office because fixed asset system is more or less quite uh i should say it's quite consistent throughout internationally the laws of uh supposing like the functions like depreciation by how many straight line methods and all that or balancing on reducing balance or double declining balance so it's more or less quite standard in the sense okay the first thing you can see that over over your left side if i'm going to sit this way it's going to be over my left side the database window is goes unlimited database so you can have number of databases there does not matter it can scroll on and on you have number of companies if you are using just one package to control number of companies' assets so you can just use a macro key and zoom into any one of these database that you already built in the system okay let's say this is the database that you have put in the system call the ea2sam and you are going into the period okay the fiscal period depends on how you identify your fiscal period let's say you go into a fiscal period of twelve which is you classify that now your fiscal period is december okay and you proceed on enter your password now your password here allows you you can see it allows you more than enough okay and right over here once you enter into this password you will come to the actual main menu and you can start having your computerisation first of all building the parameter set okay under this parameter set you have what you call miscellaneous parameters where this is where you set up okay you're start off computerisation fiscal period is it you're starting as a fiscal period six okay let's say it's six is your fiscal period now you can see the change automatically over there the period end date which means your first fiscal period accounting month is on june thirtieth of june nineteen-ninety-one ending and your last fiscal period twelve will be ending thirty-first may nineteen-ninety-two you do not have to go into that particular parameters to set the date there is an auto-control okay now if you set your this first accounting period first fiscal accounting period month as one which is january now you go and change go right into a company's name you can see that it overrides your first fiscal period becomes thirty-first january ninety-one and your ending fiscal period twelve is thirty-first december ninety-one so this is how our system controls over the parameters now if you are going into the subsequent years of ninety-two okay all you require is you put in the current accounting year which is ninety-two now you can see over there on the period end-date it has automatically change for you to nineteen-ninety-two okay so this is how the computerisation helps you to speed up in certain ways of control and right over here you put in the company's profile which is your company's name the address and the other information okay over here you can see that you will have to enter the standard currency okay your standard currency can be you can controlled as us dollar as your standard company's currency or you use singapore dollar as a standard currency control so you can enter over here and this means that how many decimal place are you giving two decimal or four decimal place so you can use it over here and all currency name now this one will be in us dollar or maybe you want it to be an alternate currency in malaysian dollar or whichever other cur country currencies you want it to be an alternate currency now the decimal place is up to you to identify and the exchange rate is also up to your company's standard company's exchange rate and over here the you will also have this what you call the capital allowances whether you are allowing the capital allowance less initial amount or full amount so it's up to you to set the parameters over here now your full-year depreciation or prorated when we talk about full-year depreciation means you're taking a full-year depreciation to equal so that you will divide by twelve month your depreciation will be spread out equally okay for the twelve months let's said if one asset is twelve thousand so you use full-year you're spread out twelve thousand divide by twelve equals to one thousand per month that will be the depreciation amount now if you are taking a pro-rate it means it will pro-rate accordingly by the month so you will pro-rate for example by the date that you acquire starts okay you depreciate according to that date and you pro-rate accordingly by rounding up the amount that is to certain months so this is the method that you could identify over here in the parameters now spaces between labels is up to you to identify what type of labels you are actually using to print numeric the asset labels for your company and you also have the audit word and right over here you have the location of dos location of document custom now this location means a lot of people ask what is this location means now this location means you can actually default okay in the c drive or d drive accordingly or you can have it set a default into the a drive by putting this function in this odd manner and under this directory okay and the file name or whatever will be default in the a drive or c drive or d drive okay if you set it you set it this way and right over here let me take this out for you okay now right over here you can see that there are a number of colours for you to select two hundred and fifty-five colours so you can if you feel tired of any of the colours you want to play around with other colours you can just switch over with the help of this box colour here now right over here will be your set-up of the column paper width okay now if you are using a printer which is eighty column width then you identify as eighty okay if you are using a printer that is for printing of hundred and thirty-two column width paper you can override this eighty column to hundred and thirty-two column width so this will enables you to set accordingly to your company's printer configurations and it has this special condensed intelligence of the reports uh the modes for you for example if the reports exceed hundred and thirty-two which is for the eighty column width it come to hundred and thirty-two maximum now the system will condense the reports automatically for you without having you to set the kind of condense mode okay now if you save this parameter and you only do it once you don't want to come back and change and change again you only change it every beginning of the year and okay the next step you go is the update of codes now you may a codes for category the supplier code country subgroup location g\l account number and you may have cost centre number and let's go into one of this okay let me go into the category i'll show it to you now under this category code you may want to identify you may want to identify a certain code now this code is four limit to four alphanumeric code you can have e001 or something else that you like to call or ea01 or you can even identify this way all in alpha but it's four alphanumeric okay now from here the description is up to you to identify what you want to call fixed asset okay equipment you may call an equipment now the next one you may want to call something like ff which is fixtures and fitting okay and you may want to fix up this one as this description so let's save this one into the window so you will have what you call uh ff code and it's the description is considered as fixtures and fittings okay after this you may want to continue okay updating or creating the other codes now you don't have to get out of this windows all you need is just press and f five key which is the macro key to help you to select into the others build a supplier code and or go into a country okay to establish at the other codes for you okay let's say you want to build another country codes like uh malaysia so you just key in m one it can be alphanumeric also and you put malaysia okay so this one will enable you to carry on okay building doing all the other codes without having to to be out of this function now you can also go into cost centre and then start building your cost centre codes and descriptions so if you have completely okay set up the parameters for all this you can just come out of this function and go into the printing modes now you can print all this that you already actually set up the table codes okay and right here system passwords after having all this set up you can go into what you call a system password where you can just build a system password for a certain level of people  you can have master you can have the other stock levels so that only certain level of people can get assess to certain functions only
