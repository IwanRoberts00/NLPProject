""
""
uhm i will be dealing with four areas
""
we'll start off with the type of materials that we've got followed
by the system that we adopted which is basically how we classify our material
followed by how we manage the centre and how we monitor students' performance
""
right we'll start off with the types of material that we've got
""
uhm video tapes lots and lots of entertainment tapes actually and
also that keeps us growing especially since well we know that we can tape
from tv okay
""
so all videos for entertainment purposes are stored in a cabinet
over here and other educational tapes uh we have we store them at the back
down there
""
and if these students think  word  on what how to
conduct interviews how to present themselves at interviews how to write uh
business letters or reports or how to use body language more effectively okay
""
uh the entertainment videos have been classified into different
categories
""
we've got shakespeare and classics which are usually based on some
literary text rather like gone with the wind adventure and drama like robin
hood prince of thieves terminator 2
""
uhm we've also got uhm mysteries thrillers and documentaries now
under computer materials we classified them under several categories
""
we got quite a lot of help material and uh under games we've got
things like scrabble and crosswords
""
assimilations we have games like uhm where in the world is town san
diego where you pretend to be detective and you go around the world searching
for information to catch a thief
""
under skills we have uhm programmes like speed reader or spell it
""
and uh the next one is language application language application we
have a concordancer the one that was uh introduced by longman the mini
concordancer which students can use
""
uhm text construction uh things like gap master where students on
the white  word  fill in you know
""
they are given a paragraph with many blank words and then students
will just type in words
""
if they're correct they get a nice sound and if they don't they get
 word  that kind of thing
""
general application software like pagemaker and uhm uh word
processing programmes
""
books and magazines you can see we have quite a lot of them will
generally on books tend to be short stories because the students that come
here don't spend a lot of time
""
so we tend to buy short stories either by local writers or others
and uhm we store in at the back over there
""
the magazines we store them here and we subscribe to four times
discover readers' digest and teens to cater to a variety of taste
""
the reading column which is a display of books basically tries to
encourage them to read the new books that we've got
""
right under audio material i must confess that we have a very very
limited supply
""
you can see under the pronunciation tapes uh the worksheets that
we've got how few we have
""
but again under educational basically they're on pronunciation and
under entertainment we have a few that uhm tell short stories like real dull
 word  stories
""
okay the main bulk of our facilities are the worksheets that we've
got and you okay and you can see them displayed right together and 
word  alright
""
we classify our worksheets into general and specific
""
general here meaning they test a variety of language areas and uhm
specific okay under general worksheets like reading listening they do at at 'o'
level
""
basically what we mean they will test things like grammar
vocabulary and other  word 
""
under the specific worksheets we've got pronunciation vocabulary
grammar and special skills
""
uhm the special skills include things like writing a resume writing
a business letter and under information skills students are encouraged to
learn how to use a thesaurus how to use a dictionary
""
now the materials that we store in the filing cabinets we uh store
four copies of each material okay for the students to use
""
and don't know about copyright laws but we store four copies of
each uhm worksheet that we've got and uh two answer sheets which we separate
which we put at beside uh in the filing cabinets that which you should take a
look later
""
the main reason actually for this is that because we find that a
lot of our students simply copying the answers if we put them together with
the worksheet
""
so it really defeated the purpose
""
so we make them actually we have to walk over there to take the
answer sheets so that they can use them
""
okay so now i'll come to the system we've adopted that helps us to
classify the materials that we got've
""
we use the two prong  word  system a vending
system for the levels of difficulty and a classification system
""
okay let's look at the vending first and uh if you take a look your
handout page one you see a sample of how we classify students' in terms of
writing
""
uh the best open book for listening uh speaking reading
comprehension and things like that so each one is separate
""
okay so if you take a look at uh page one we actually only offer
four levels level four to level seven based on the types of students that we
get
""
now actually most of our students are the got like that one meh
""
you know which means they are level four possibly level five yah
""
we don't get any students who are the a one type so most our
materials are concentrated on level four and five
""
so if you take a look at this you see that under level four the
students should be able to write simple paragraphs without guidance
""
uhm will produces  word  writing that lacks
clarity coherence and relevance uh other than simple paragraphs okay
""
we also use a colour colson colson a colour code to help the
students locate the materials easily and for us level four materials which
are the simplest are coded yellow
""
level five materials are coded pink uh level six materials are
coded blue and level seven seven materials are beige or cream
""
oh under the specs the classification system that helps us to
determine what area under vocabulary or grammar
""
if you take a look at page two we categorise our materials quite uh
complexly
""
i suppose because you'll see that the classification system we use
is very teacher oriented and not really student oriented
""
so under vocabulary for example uhm two one four to us means
homonyms and uhm two three zero means affixes in general which means the
students don't really know what they're looking for when they look at the
materials in there unless they refer to the files on the teacher's desk
""
so if they were to just go to the vocabulary section they just flip
out a piece of material that's numbered two three zero
""
generally they don't really know what's it all about
""
they just read the title and it means something like uhm uh affixes
you know but they don't really know that that is the category for affixes and
there's no don't know if that's really what they want
""
so they just go in they look look whatever looks interesting and
then they just take it out
""
so i think that perhaps is a an area we could improve on
""
okay now the materials that we've got basically use a three prong
system
""
we have an explanation sheet uhm worksheet and a answer sheet
""
and the explanation sheet and worksheet are kept together near to
the filing pockets
""
all the worksheet uh sorry all the explanation sheets are beige in
colour
""
that's how the students pick them out
""
well if you look at page three four five and six this is a sample
set of materials to do with equerry  word  name name four
zero one
""
and four zero one to us means singular and plural
""
so a student who takes out the worksheet which is from page four
and five will see the title singular or plural and will be instruction that
says you name me explanation four zero one stroke one
""
well this explanation sheet like i said is found in that same
pocket go through this and just pull it out
""
they read the explanation sheet if they need to and then they do
the exercise alright
""
by the end of the exercises they are directed to check an answer
sheet also follow the same number exactly as in the answer sheet five stroke
one
""
okay let me just explain the numbers
""
okay worksheet four stroke one to us means level four and the first
worksheet produced under this level
""
so we can have worksheet four stroke two four stroke three which
means that more and more worksheets have been prepared and even under the
same category but a level five worksheet then will start off again worksheet
five stroke one for explanation one zero and so on
""
alright that's how you keep track of our materials
""
okay if however it is a text which deals with reading comprehension
on the 'o' levels then the students will be directed to a text not an
explanation sheet okay
""
they will go right to the worksheet please take text zero zero zero
one in order for you to do this worksheet
""
all our worksheets also are tailored to under an hour so that the
students don't have to spend too much time here because we're basically a
supplement to their main curriculum
""
they are given curriculum time to come here and sit down and
actually work on the materials
""
so this means that they come as and when they are free and this
usually means like lunch break or after they finish their classes
""
so they really only come when they have time and it might be just
in between classes so the worksheets are all specifically tailored to that
 word  alright
""
okay now how to use the self-access system itself
""
at the very beginning of our academic year all first year students
all scheduled for a half hour visit to the centre that shows them a short
video which you will watch
""
and uhm enables them to know what is what this place where the
place is and also you know ask questions if they need to so that they can use
it more effectively
""
we'll show you the short video
""
okay uhm if you take a look at the brochure you'll see that the
system that the students follow is printed for you so you can look at it at
your own leisure
""
i'm going to move on now to the management of the of the centre how
we take turns to make sure that the centre runs smoothly
""
well under planning of the centre we have one full-time clerical
staff who's stationed here from nine to five
""
and there are six lecturers who take turns uh we schedule planning
hours to be here from nine to five okay
""
now we get a trade-off of teaching hours if we ran the centre for
three hours we get a trade-off of two teaching hours which means that you
know is we spend a little bit more time here or you'll have to teach so much
alright
""
alright under general supervision we manage things like the
students like telling them where to put their bags and files making sure that
they don't steal the materials making sure that they don't vandalise they
don't bring in their own computer programmes to copy what we've got yah
""
i mean equipment we make sure that if they want to make use the
photocopier they ask us for permission
""
and uhm make sure also that they don't use the printer unless we
specifically give them permission to
""
uhm under materials we make sure that the students return the
materials correctly to the pigeon holes
""
we make sure that uh if the materials need to be filed they are
filed in the proper filing pockets because otherwise materials get lost all
over the place
