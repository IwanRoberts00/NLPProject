thank you for coming down uhm today for taking your time off uh i'd like to actually just start off this talk uh by giving you a little bit of introduction of our company uhm you may heard of unilever but not of many them as a matter of fact would have actually about our organisation unilever but i'm pretty sure that all of you would have heard about the products that we market and the kind of businesses that we handle in singapore uh if i told you that uhm we are the people who actually manufacture and market products like lipton walls ponds elizabeth arden and uh something like another three hundred and seventy more products you'll be surprised in fact uh unilever is listed in fortune five hundred as the twentieth largest company in the world we are we were listed as the most profitable consumer products company in the world by fortune five hundred and uh that really makes us to a very large corporation now just to give you a little bit of background about unilever unilever is actually a huge multi-national that is anglo-dutch fifty per cent owned by london fifty per cent owned by rotterdam uh in singapore basically we are a marketing uh operation but we do have a lipton tea fac uh tea factory in singapore uh that's one of the reasons why we have also invited uhm some people from mechanical engineering will be able to ? ? answers of the day in fact uh we have been labelled as the tea excellence setter from this region and you you may be surprised that we are actually supplying chinese tea to china okay it's a fact and we we have been labelled as the most efficient production facility in the world by a by an international uh tea-tasting consulting firm and uh that leaves singapore's uh facility a very small but very effective operating unit we produce something like about three million tea bags a day and uh we amongst our suppliers as i mentioned includes china taiwan south korea japan chile malaysia indonesia so on and so forth now in singapore we are a we are a set up that that is about uh two hundred employees strong uh we about evenly distributed into well fifty per cent into manufacturing and fifty per cent into administrative services uh our operations are basically to as i mentioned market about uh the three hundred odd products that we actually manufacture and uh what we what we are basically a marketing driven firm which is supported by a sales function as well as personnel and commercial function now you may have uh you may have heard about our competitive competitors uh which uh sometime feature more prominently than ourselves namely procter and gamble and uh johnson and johnson and so on and so forth main thing is because they do use their company names behind them in marketing their products but unilever is a completely different set up because we have got operations not only in consumer products division but also in chemicals specialty chemicals uh patients?? and uh several other uh several other i should say business ventures we we we even have finance companies as well as uhm as well as uh bank a little bit of a little of finance as well as banking operations world wide where we have gone into joint ventures and we have even moved into uh information technology so actually unilever is one company which can offer all of you graduates who'd be coming out next year a pretty good career opportunity as well as placement the reason is because of as far as unilever is concerned we've got one of the best human resource policies uh where we actually plan for people's career advancement three year in advance then we we know exactly how many people we are recruiting over the next three years how our organisational structure will change over the next three years taking into consideration of the uhm market considerations and we've also know exactly who would be moving up when what sort of training opportunities we'll be having for each and every employee of ours now just to go into a little bit about training we are we are proud to say that we are one of the fore forerunners in terms of training in singapore we also expend something like six per cent of our payroll in fact that was that is the latest figure i just i have just fresh out of the budget meeting we have managed to spend something like about six per cent of our payroll on training on employees in singapore our training is basically unilever specific the reason is because we have got very structured international training programmes where what we do is that when we hire you recruits into our especially management trainees we we we call you new hires as management trainees when we hire management trainees into our company what we do is that we put them on the job training for about a year and right after that we do identity a main core group of management trainees who we will be willing to invest upon and what would happen is that you would be setting up a business principles' course for that particular group of people uh which exposes them to all of unilever functions now this is a regional course it's usually held around this region uh where it is rotated of course after attending this particular business principles' course and we would we would we would evaluate each and every management trainee right after this particular business principles' course which is very very uh vigorous i must say it's a tough two-week programme and once we give uh once we complete it you'll be out for evaluation now if you do well in that particular business principles' course then we would then go on to arrange for a swop programme for you where you would be spending six months of your working career in another country what we do is that we exchange you for someone else either from the function or from a different from another country like for instance if we swop you say with thai thailand then a person from thailand which could be coming down to singapore take away position and every for six months basically you'd be on your own you'd be given a budget to manage and uh you'd be in a completely immersed into a completely different uh environment as well as a country now you may feel a little bit apprehensive about it but uh actually this programme is to get people more mature in their working life and experience it's to train people to actually independently handle problems and uhm get your yourself immerse into the business into a different kind of environment that's the main objective behind this programme after which we would chart a specific course of career path for you and depending on it you you would be attending at least one regional or professional training training programme every two years you can see that unilever is one company which actually invests hell of a lot on their employees well as they say nothing is for free right why do we invest so much on our people it's because we demand results from the people whom we hire also it's because we believe a person cannot be adding on value through the company without the relevant train training via exposure in fact that's one of the reasons why a few years back unilever set up its own universities we call it the four acres where we we send our top most and the best employees to be trained in london in boston or in south america we've got three universities all over the world it shows the kind of commitment that we have in our people now i'd be uh screening?? you a little bit uh uh uh uh corporate video that uh we actually have involves the people talking about the uhm company's practice the kind of exposure that they have the kind of uh training that they receive and the kind of career development that we have offered to our uh employees shortly okay but before that i would like to also emphasize that when you work with unilever you'd have to be internationally mobile not just in the short-term but in the long-term the reason is because we do believe in exposing people all the around not only this region but also the world we have got several regional coordination office always which is pretty hungry for people we're also looking for a lot of people to be placed in china there's definitely?? whole exciting market and that's where we're sending most of our people to in fact last year we sent three of our top managers over to china and this year we'd be sending uh one person over to mexico and we'll to evaluate a few more people to be expatriated to some other countries okay so we do offer people places overseas but that is provided that each employee proves himself to be worthy of that sort of investment and exposure now you may have asked me uh the kinds of career opportunities that are available within unilever as of now now as of now as of today i'm not looking for any person but i am i would definitely be looking for people when at the at or about the time when you graduate that would be sometime in february or march as i said we do have a regular programme of expatriating our employees and when when we expatriate employees we would have opportunities for local graduates to actually fill up those positions and that's when when we would like you to apply to unilever and the selection criteria is pretty tough uh i would like i i i would not go into the selection criteria nor the process in which we actually recruit people because it's uh relatively confidential but we do have a structured way of recruiting people but the kind of people whom we are looking for is number one the person has to have has to be street smart okay ultimately i was just telling a colleague of mine you know in fact in fact in the recent recruitment fair uh lots of people were asking me this question uh do i have to be a biz ad graduate in order to be recruited to the marketing department uh the answer to it is no in fact half of the marketing department is filled with physics graduates okay i'm not i'm not suggesting that you have to be a physics graduate to be uh recruited into my marketing department but it involves hell of a lot of common sense involves hell of a lot of number crunching it involves attraction it involves an articulate and clear thinking personality so do it these are the general qualities that we are actually looking for and we are looking for people as i was mentioning in sales marketing commercial which includes financial and management accounting as well as i t information technology as well as to run the production facility as a management trainee you come in of course you have to be trained to run production facility but ultimately you would be running the factory in singapore so these are the qualities of people calibre of people that we are looking for when we recruit for management trainees for next year okay now uh what i'll do is that now i i'd play the uh recruitment video uh it's about fifteen to twenty uh fifteen to eighteen minutes i'm know that it's about eighteen minutes long okay after which uh i i have a brochures of our my company uh describing what exactly i have told you as of now  and uhm perhaps if you have any questions to ask me after that uh i'd be more than willing to uh answer you okay
