then they got band isn't it
""
""
oh ya every night band

won't one thing disturb the other
""
""
uhm no
""
see they arrange it so that when the plays in the open air are
going on the bands are not performing
""
""
uhm
""
""
see then when the plays in the open air are over the bands
perform
""
""
but then the black box
""
""
while the other plays go on in the building
""
""
in the black box and and
""
""
and
""
""
other places
""
""
another place
""
ya
""
""
and then the films also isn't it
""
""
ya so you you
""
""
hor they got some 'ge lan' film
""
i saw it was
""
""
ya ya
""
""
live you know
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
those chinese old chinese films
""
""
ya who's ge lan huh
""
""
ge lan was uhm a star you know during the time when there was
a ling chui and all that
""
you see uh si qian jing uh in the nineteen fifties sixties
""
""
uh huh
""
""
ya
""
""
who are the si qian jing
""
""
oh she she she could sing and dance lah
""
""
oh
""
""
so there was a film she made called uh mum bo girl
""
""
she wasn't called the si qian jing  word 
""
si qian jing was ling chui
""
""
ling chui ge lan isn't it
""
i thought ling chui ge lan that group lor
""
about the same time as lin tai you know
""
""
ling tai i know
""
""
ah about the same about but they belong to different
organizations
""
lin tai belonged to shaw brothers i think
""
""
uhm
""
""
and ge lan belonged to cathay organization
""
""
oh
""
""
ya
""
so and then what time you you can enter at what time and finish
off at what time
""
""
anytime anytime you go anytime
""
""
anytime
""
""
ya
""
""
and then come out anytime but the whole thing ends what time
uh
""
""
well eleven about eleven the whole thing ends
""
""
uhm i see
""
""
ya
""
""
but that were uh were there lots of people
""
""
oh ya
""
""
uhm
""
""
ya
""
""
so it's quite successful lah
""
""
ya i think so
""
""
actually uhm yuh theatreworks
""
was it tay tong or somebody who rang me up
""
""
uhm
""
""
they wanted chinese opera you see
""
""
ha
""
""
ya
""
""
aiyoh  laughs 
""
""
because they thought opera on the hill and i think they got
beijing opera you know
""
they got  word 
""
""
ya ya they got  word 
""
""
from i don't know
""
they've performed already is it
""
""
ya
""
""
oh i thought i wanted to go and see
""
so they asked us to go you see
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
then because we also had our festival uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
so i said we're very busy but if the timing fits uh might be
we could you see
""
""
uhm
""
""
then i asked him about pricing lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
supposing you know if it is open air uh it would be nice to
have live music right
""
""
uhm
""
""
musicians and all that playing uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
so if you have live musicians uh then the cost would go up
""
""
uhm ya
""
""
and if you've taped music of course it would be very cheap
nuh
""
""
not nice ya
""
""
but won't be nice
""
so i thought you know taped music won't be so effective
""
anyway i've told them the cost but they never came back to me
""
""
it's probably too expensive
""
""
probably too expensive
""
""
ya i wonder how much they pay all these charge  word
""
""
""
and then i i told them you know they could even have the
china people perform right
""
""
ya ya
""
""
for example 'lan ma' uh
""
""
the guests
""
""
uh guests
""
that will be very nice isn't it
""
""
ya
""
""
but i suppose they probably couldn't budget so much to pay
for it
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so the whole thing was out lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
i mean they they never contacted me again
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
""
""
but it's quite a thing
""
""
ya it's quite fun
""
""
and then it is a nice uh atmosphere you know
""
""
ya
""
""
you have the hill
""
if people go then it's very enjoyable
""
""
ya
""
""
ya
""
""
it's very nice what
""
last mon monday we went right
""
""
uhm
""
""
and then so we finished watching haresh's play and then we
went to
""
""
how long was haresh's play
""
""
one hour
""
his was long lah
""
""
what was it about
""
""
about three friends
""
i mean two sisters and their friend
""
""
uhm
""
""
and how one of the girls lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
is uhm likes to doesn't want change
""
""
uhm
""
""
doesn't want changes in her life you see
""
""
uhm
""
""
and the other two want changes
""
so the friend goes off to philippines to look for his parents his
real parents
""
""
uhm
""
""
and then the girl's sister moves out of the house because she
says that too many ghosts in the house
""
too many too many too much burden lah of the past
""
she wants to she wants change lah
""
so it's about that kind of thing lah
""
""
was it in the open air or
""
""
no it was in black box
""
""
black box
""
but not many people can see isn't it
""
it's a small theatre  word 
""
""
ya
""
but enough lah
""
i mean if you go there every night so ya
""
""
uhm so is necessary stage performing
""
""
ya  word 
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
""
no talks and all that nuh
""
""
nope it's just  word 
""
""
the band local band
""
""
ya all local bands
""
""
good or not
""
""
very good very good ya
""
""
ha
""
very good
""
what what did they play
""
""
their own music and other people's music lor
""
""
ya some uh one night i saw rock band
""
different different types uh
""
""
yeah yeah
""
like those the ones that i was playing on the cd that night lor
""
""
uhm but no oriental music uh
""
""
no no
""
""
uhm
""
""
ya
""
""
anyway what do you think
""
""
huh
""
""
do you think it's a it's a good idea
""
""
one thing is
""
ya i think it's fun
""
there's a lot of fun there's a lot of fun
""
""
uhm
""
""
very good lah
""
""
so the people who were trained are youngsters
""
""
got some ang mos
""
""
got a lot of kwai lo uh
""
""
no there are more there are more locals than there are ang
mos
""
""
huh
""
""
then got some very yuppie yuppie types
""
then some parents bring their kiddies along lah  word
""
""
""
kiddies
""
""
ya
""
""
ha
""
""
but mostly very young lah
""
""
huh kiddies
""
""
ya
""
""
they won't appreciate
""
""
that's why
""
""
some of the things
""
""
that's why
""
""
ya
""
""
then some of the plays  word 
""
some of the plays are marked with an asterisk
""
""
ah
""
""
then they say these plays contain strong language and adult
abuse
""
so to warn you lah
""
don't bring your children to watch these kinds of stuff
""
""
 laughs 
""
ya
""
""
ya
""
""
some are like that
""
""
ya
""
""
i see
""
how long it'll last uh
""
one month
""
three weeks or what
""
""
the third what fourteen or something  word
""
""
""
but it clashes with the film fes isn't it
""
""
ya everything clashes with film fes
""
ya ya everything clashes with film fes lor
""
then just before film fes
""
""
uhm
""
""
at that european community film fes
""
""
oh
""
""
ya
""
""
but that was before the film fes so it's not so bad you see
""
""
ya ya but then it's like you know
""
""
too close
""
""
ya
""
then you got to spend so much money
""
""
uhm and so much time
""
uhm
""
""
ya
""
""
is that film fes is still on uh
""
""
yep until next sunday
""
""
oh so it really clashes uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
i don't know why they don't space it out properly uh
""
""
ya don't know lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
there's a lot of explanations and and all that
""
then june got arts fes
""
""
ya june got arts fes so whoa this year full of fes
""
tiring lah hor
""
""
ya sometimes
""
okay lah
""
i mean it's probably the same crowd who go to film fes and arts
fes 
""
""
ya the same people what a lot of yuppies also go to this
""
""
and it's amazing you know the shows uh most of the films are
i think sold out you know
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
ya
""
""
but film fes usually like that
""
""
ya
""
""
you find it hard to guide   get  get tickets
""
""
ya but then then it's like you know the rest of the year we
don't have very good stuff in the local cinemas
""
""
uhm
""
""
then but then when the film fes comes around people snap up
the tickets so that means there is a market for for this kind of more unusual
films
""
""
not really you know i mean because there's a film fes sort
of people know that these things are on if you space it out and you put it on
the commercial market nuh
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
then you may miss it you know
""
""
market you then you must publicize it market it 
word 
""
""
and then the commercial market uh for this type of film uh
it won't last long you see couple of days uh then by the time you get to know
about it it's off right
""
""
ya that's why they they don't publicize their stuff properly
especially cathay
""
""
whereas in the film fes it's all concentrated
""
""
ya and they have publicity whereas like you know a lot of
commercial cinemas they don't publicize their films so couple of good films
come to cathay you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
go to picture house or whatever
""
""
and then you miss
""
""
they're not publicized at all there's no write-up about them
you know nothing about them three days later they're gone
""
""
uhm
""
""
so i figured it out cathay's tac tactic is uh they bring in
the big films right
""
""
uhm
""
""
and then in between the big films they throw in filler
movies
""
""
uhm
""
""
and i think that sometimes the filler movies are worth
watching people would go and watch if only you promote the movies i think you
can earn even more money
""
""
but maybe they think it's too much money to spend on
advertisements ya
""
""
ya but it's it's such a waste you know
""
""
ya
""
""
such a waste
