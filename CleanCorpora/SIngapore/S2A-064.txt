sir the appellant defendant's position is that this court
should affirm the decision of the judge below and dismiss the respondent's
notice if the court finds the following
""
one that the general law right of set off and counterclaim has not
been removed by the contract particularly clause thirty-one point eleven
""
two that the learned judge below has exercise his judicial
discretion correctly in respect of the interest awarded and his order to stay
proceedings pending arbitration of the sum of five hundred and nineteen two
hundred and eighty-four
""
and thirdly the respondents and the plaintiffs should make a proper
application before the registrar to amend their writ if they intend to pursue
the matter relating to the sum of two hundred and six thousand dollars
""
of course your honour have allowed the respondent to amend the
respondent's notice earlier on but that is only in respect
""
if i understand it correctly to amend the respondent's notice
whether or not they will succeed on their submissions is another thing
""
may i now go straight into the reply to my learned friend's outline
submission
""
your honour the sub-paragraph the references to the outline
submission
""
in answer to paragraph two point three of the outline submission the
appellants object to the respondents raising the matter relating to the sum
of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars on the grounds that a the
respondents had conceded before the learned judge below that the same was
properly deducted
""
they are in respectful submission has stopped from raising this
amount
""
i will deal with this matter more fully in my later submission
""
two the said sum of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars
properly certified by the architects as an amount deductible
""
as yong j have correctly pointed out based on my learned friend's
line of submission it is my observation that that particular certificate
certifying the amount of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars as
being payable was made pursuant to the contract
""
and if clause thirty-one point eleven is to be given full effect as
the marginal note suggests then until such time as this certificate is set
aside full effect must be given
""
my learned friend has mentioned that they do not know how this
amount was arrived
""
may i at this juncture refer your honour to clause thirty-one point
eleven of the contract to be found at page two hundred and eighty of bundle
marked the record of appeal r a two page two hundred and eighty r a two
""
""
what page
""
what page
""
""
two hundred and eighty your honour fifth line from the bottom
of clause thirty-one point eleven
""
in any case of doubt
""
fifth line from the bottom of that paragraph
""
in any case of doubt the architect shall at the request of either
parties state in writing within twenty-eight days
""
 reads 
""
or the nature of any ruling made by him as the case may be
""
sir clause thirty-one point eleven provides for a mode by which
either party if they are not sure as to how a particular figure is arrived at
in the certificate to request the architect to clarify and identify
""
this was not done when the certificates were issued
""
it was considered before the learned judge below
""
i would submit that until the final determination of the case
either before the courts or before the arbitrator full effect should be given
to this particular certificate
""
i pause here to add that this is an order fourteen application that
we are talking about
""
it's not the full trial and the appellant/defendant will show that
they have raised triable issues for it to be tried in the full court
""
next sir i turn to paragraphs three to fourteen of the outline
submission at page two of the outline submission
""
sir i will just say that these as my learned friend has pointed out
relates to the history of proceedings and he has taken your honour through
those various paragraphs and i don't think i need to address them
""
next sir paragraph fifteen the revised certificates were held to be
invalid by the learned judge below
""
that is only in respect of the revised certificates
""
however it is submitted that certificate number twenty-nine is not
invalid or in any event the defendants have raised an arguable case for
purpose of order fourteen proceedings
""
sir may i refer you to page twenty-two of the judgment of thean j
to be found at page four hundred and thirty-six r a volume two
""
page four hundred and thirty-six r a two
""
seventh line from the second paragraph your honour at this stage
""
at this stage it cannot be said that this certificate is invalid
nor am i in the position to say whether or not the defendants are entitled to
this amount
""
 reads 
""
if established is deductible from the amount due to the plaintiffs
""
sir i pause here to raise clause one point seven
""
the learned judge has stated that and under clause seven this
amount if established is deductible from the amount due to the plaintiffs
""
i have considered in my summary reply that we are not relying on
clause one point seven in respect of the three hundred and eighty-one
thousand
""
i say it because clearly one point seven does not apply
""
but i think by drafting it or writing it as the learned judge did
to say that under clause one point seven this amount if established is
deductible from the amount due to the plaintiffs
""
i think he had in mind the appellant/defendant's right of set off
which in our submission has not been removed by clause thirty-one point
eleven
""
so if they ultimately can establish that this is the amount to be
expanded for rectification works the architect can then issue a fresh
certificate under clause one point seven
""
there has been no final certificate issued in this case
""
no final certificate has been issued in this case
""
so it is still open to the architect to take into account
subsequent factors and issue fresh certificates
""
so in respect of para sixteen of the respondent's outline
submission he says in the midst of the proceedings for summary judgment
before the assistant registrar lojan in an apparent attempt to defeat
tropicon's application suggested by letter dated twenty-fourth that they
should consider taking action under clause thirty-one point four
""
here the respondents suggesting that there are something sinister
or unusual or an unusual act to defeat their claim
""
the truth of the matter is that clause thirty-one point four
provides for correcting of earlier certificates issued by the architects
""
so it was at that point of time proper for d p architects to issue
the revised certificates to correct the original certificates which the
employers have indicated to them that you have not taken into account certain
factors
""
can you please look into it
""
so my answer to that is that it was a legitimate attempt to correct
the earlier certificates
""
on the question of liquidated damages your honour at page four of
my summary having withdrawn our appeal we do not challenge the learned
judge's ruling on liquidated damages
""
the appellant/defendants would accept for purposes of this appeal
that the extended completion date is thirty-first december nineteen
eighty-four for the main building and eighteenth february for the swimming
pool and external works
""
but we maintained that the practical completion date is first july
nineteen eighty-five and this is pursuant to a certificate issued to that
effect this is to be found at page three hundred and thirty three r a volume
two
""
and i don't think my learned friend is disputing that practical
completion was first july eighty five
""
sir it is important to note that when the architects certified
practical completion on this day he did indicate that subject to making good
of any outstanding items of any apparent defects shrinkages and other faults
which appear during the defects liability period
""
sir i pause here to say that if the dates as stated here are to be
accepted technically there would have been a delay as far as the main
building works are concerned a delay of six months
""
and taking the agreed liquidated damages to be paid per day that
works out to something like three hundred and sixty-six thousand dollars and
this i would submit is a bona fide claim a claim which can be substantiated
if not in this proceedings before the arbitrator
""
sir i go now to paragraph seven of my summary
""
i will skip paragraph six clause thirty one point eleven principle
regarding deductions and set off
""
so the marginal note to this clause is effect of architect's
certificate
""
it allows both the employer and contractor to claim on the
architect's certificates and in the absence of fraud or improper pressure or
interference by either party to obtain summary judgment
""
it does not however remove the party's right to claim under the
general law of set off and counterclaim
""
and in support of this proposition i rely on the case of gilbert
ash the house of lord's decision to be found at page one of bundle marked a b
eight
""
sir i have taken the liberty of reproducing the relevant pages
unless your honour would want me to refer to the actual report i would rely
on the extracts
""
sir at page one hundred and ninety-eight paragraph d judgment of
lord reed where he says the sole question in the appeal is whether by the
contract with the sub-contractors
""
the contractors have agreed that sums which they received from the
employers here marked as due to sub-contractors on architects interim
certificates must be paid over immediately without any rights of set off
""
sir this is a case involving dispute between the contractors and
the sub-contractors
""
i think the principle applies equally to a dispute between employer
and a contractor
""
next sir at page two hundred j the judgment of lord morris
""
when parties entered into a detailed building contract there are
however no overriding rules of principles covering their contractual
relationship beyond those which generally apply to the construction of
contracts
""
in other words there are no fixed rules or principles each case
depends on the construction of the contract in question
""
over the page judgment of lord morris again nor if the contract
provides for the issuing of interim certificates should it be supposed that
that's of a special class will come into existence that is that's in relation
to which there can not under any circumstances be any defence of set off
""
i think there is a spelling typographical error of set off
""
there was no affidavit filed by the appellants but it was accepted
that the claims which they had made as set out in their defence were bona
fide claims
""
sir this passage is quoted for the purpose to show that the claims
that the employers have against the contractor are bona fide claims and they
are not frivolous or unsubstantiated claims
""
next the judgment of viscount bilhorn where he deals with the case
of donay
""
prior to nineteen seventy-one and the decision of the court of
appeal in donays versus mintah it appears to have been generally thought that
an employer was entitled to set off a counterclaim against the amount
certified
""
in halsbury law of england it is said the contractor is entitled to
immediate payment thereof subject to the terms of the contract and any right
of the employer to set off or counterclaim for example for liquidated damages
""
indeed no sentilar?? of authority prior to the decision in donay's
case can be found for the proposition that the amount certified by the
architect in an interim certificate as the value of work done and
consequently payable to the contractor
""
i believe is in a special position in that the employer cannot
lawfully counterclaim and set off against the liability amounts due to him
from the contractor
