so the first part will be a brief lit review what should come first the bit about singapore or the bit about this uhm the lit review or should we then use this we start with here skip that we start with here since this part has been thrown out anyway okay uhm so it's not so much of lit review but a review on singapore as a society in composition and and then a brief mention of the different strategies available in developing and developed ya a brief a brief a very brief mention then so the next bit we state in state impacts right on uh state policies and impacts on household structure first state impact oh we forgot the bit about women that's here is it ya reviewing sing singapore women rather this one will include change in religious word  women's women's structures or something uh women's priority ah and change in household structure that impact is on this point so in this case just to review two strengths and policy uh state policies and the impacts on household structure and state policies on child care and some here somewhere here we mention that or here that they are uhm logical uh they've no ethnic bias make it more implicit that they they they don't regard one group above another of this special persons you see the multi-racial identity multi-racial and then we talk about the h d b and other housing policy and down here m c b here put all the m c b stuff here then more explicit exactly what they do right so what we're saying is that uhm because singapore is changing uhm traditional forms of child care are now disappearing right and uh new ones are emerging the the state uh is trying to do a couple things one is to try to provide alternate means of childcare in terms of the childcare centres and secondly to try to encourage in some form of that traditional support structure so it'll carry on that's about all uhm okay ya what what i do fairly nicely right word to  word on okay first of all we could have all all this stuff about how uhm childcare centres are very popular so that's part one right with with women in singapore so this will have partial word  i think we can use like uhm some of the board general idea ya so there will be specific data that which i know data that across all household types and in in fact across all ethnic groups except or perhaps the malays uhm has been a very acceptable form of child care childcare centres word after all household structures then word  except uh perhaps the malays malay okay and then uhm secondly uhm so that's the response  word then response to housing to energy word arrangement and  word and word  so are we saying that the women like responding fairly well to this as well to this this strategy this state policy perhaps you may not say that the women are responding well but that uhm this kind of strategy is correct and if the women are shown that with more than just state rhetoric you know they okay this is working use it this is in fact the case that these women are finding it less of a problem because they have really readily available help at home okay so it is useful uhm but uh i think we could then end by saying that uhm that uhm these have not proven entirely sufficient because women are still finding or some women are finding it a need to turn to foreign maids uhm what's the other one which is up here foreign maids right and that uh even with all these options there are still gaps which is which will be the gaps will be all those who quit right and a few household housewives  word as far as word  no it's that it's i think it is gelling on all the ideas that we have been working with and not the next stage will be the uh economic restructuring phase uh women quitting and also the cultural constraints word  i think that's enough nah ya and i don't know right i mean if the introduction takes up if you're talking about like six pages the rest will take up about this will take up say three quarters of the page one or two pages of the page aye i think it's more than one ya because it has all the data ya one and a half maybe this one will be about two and a half two and a half no i can't allow that then we have no more space if this is one this is two then this is to be this is about two and a half two pages should be okay right if this is one and a half then two three four five and six okay should be i mean this is this is the maximum if you know it's going it's five hundred pages five hundred words per page right if it's single interruption  uhm lily wants to know whether you're okay next tuesday 2:30 pm for i t h g okay i've asked her to give it okay so when am i going to get around here so should i tell her that you might do when you're slightly no i don't think you need to tell her that she doesn't word  so sorry well i'll just say that uhm that we left lah should i tell her that we are currently revising that's not necessary is that right uhm i mean because it does it doesn't concern how she's already said here that uh she doesn't want her word  paper give given the the larger papers went in right ya and anyway if this comes out word we could always refrain ya and this this will be different it's not it's not it's not about what the household to feed the household and childcare these these actually very huge terms you know so how the same in childcare and things like that that's too bad well leave that as a working title first and when we get round to it's basically a policy evaluation type paper right ya from what what she feel i think it'd be much better to go along with my if you want to you could but i don't think necessary but if you want to you can say that uh you're revising the paper to send it off elsewhere but uhm you're happy to to summarise the main ideas uh to give emphasis to state poli policies in singapore mention the what's this for asian cities word  you seem to be getting a bit more mileage out of that conference that caused you so much agony agony i think i'm sick because of it must have settle with my bone last night i could not even swallow it was so painful because after a talk to marietha for two hours i went home i discovered my voice had totally disappeared and my my throat  word was very very swollen every time i swallowed it was like pain word  you know when we have a fish bone stuck in your throat i felt so bad and word oh my goodness when i left my medicine at work because i was so late i just grabbed everything and i went and then i convey to my husband i said this new antibotics you've given me is not working and this the worse way word acting on because you can't take all the others but luckily by around six o'clock next morning word  when i take look at and then i took another one so so what did your husband say it is it's a throat infection throat infection okay so uhm their their deadline is end of january right i know if i don't get it done we've i think we'll try to do it by december then you which one is given by word or the other this one is easier lah ah sure but they want don't want already so that's more or less there it will be centre this one you know that uhm i think it's safer to do the other one first because then at least i know what's ready word  that's right i think we give priority to that one i'll that day you know you're trying to tell me to do both by december i mean i know it's necessary but it's well i have to get round to doing the women's studies one too and that's like one out of word twenty still haven't revise my word  oh that should be quite fast what why don't you do when fauziah's around she was she i i gave it to her and word  it's basically that one section that has been rewritten right i don't remember she she just looked at it and wrote some stuff on the piece of paper we talked about it and i was like okay okay never mind we could say something bad about sharmala that is true and karmalini ai aiyah what i always say to karmalini i always hear them before i see them the three studious three oh ya uh what's the other girl's name you know the one who's walked in suzanna let's say it loud stop this right no she wants us to continue talking for a while more oh or you want it back or you want to continue talking for a while more uh maybe another what do you need it if you don't need it it's five minutes okay fine you just stay outside five minutes ya okay okay so and then uh this so this thing would be about how multi-generational households different members use how they use space in different types of flats right and uh some themes would be like the how they negotiate public and private space and uh how uhm how they were maximised what what's the term i want where you use the space for multiple purposes like something could be used as as a sleeping quarters at one point of time and then change no because all like for example smaller flats a bit of constraints so uh negotiating constraints of space okay like uh multiple functions that kind of thing right or where you have to have two dinner times or that kind of thing right ya i think we just talk about it as temporal staggering of like bathing ya i think it's one f brenda sorry staggering off shoo don't bathe today don't eat today and we could think of other things ya and perhaps also like uhm if we do manage to find part of it in the case study ask them what they would like you know and whether they could word extensions extra balcony space and all that so this creeps in to the upgrading we will step on certain people's toes sometimes what what physical aspects they will like changed what their okay this will particularly be pertinent in the m g flat which is specially designed and then for those for the other two types we could talk about for the last type the three room we could talk about upgrading upgrading and what they would like to see the extra balcony and all that because uhm ya word time it's it is not mine neighbour but it will be coming soon so uhm you know we might be able to it'd be nice to have on the word have already had it but the upgrading process hasn't proceeded far enough ya because the one in-charge of jalan nela was only a few and we could go and ask we could get louviana to give us the contact she did  how how is she
