""
""
oh no
""
""
i don't know what to say now
""
we've exhausted everything
""
""
i'm nervous
""
ya
""
you've had to start since it's after all all your doing
""
""
has it started yet
""
it's started already
""
oh no
""
""
well say something
""
""
we had so much to say
""
""
ya
""
""
we had so much to say
""
""
i think uhm i wonder how sensitive this microphone is
""
are we speaking too softly do you think
""
""
i don't know
""
""
well speak up then
""
okay so have you have you figured out how to uhm teach me how to
buy pork bones
""
""
oh no i forgot all about that
""
""
oh you forgot the recipe
""
uhm
""
""
pork bones from cold storage
""
""
oh really
""
just buy the pork bones
""
""
i think so
""
""
and then what do you do
""
just dump it in hot just dump it in water and let it boil
""
""
that's what i would do
""
""
and then
""
""
uhm
""
""
i mean how do you know it's ready
""
""
oh uhm i think it get it becomes frothy
""
""
oh then you have to some kind of scummy kind of frost rises to
the surface
""
""
ya and you'll you'll have to scoop off the scum and throw it
out
""
""
throw it out
""
""
and you can put in other ingredients like
""
""
so as long as it's frothing just scoop off all the froth
""
""
yeah
""
""
and then what happens
""
and then it just keeps boiling and boiling
""
""
ya i i'm not sure
""
maybe i've got to boil it for about two hours
""
""
and then
""
""
uhm
""
""
and then after you've skinned it all off what you have is pure
stock is it
""
""
i think so
""
ya ack oh
""
""
oh
""
""
you'll probably add some spices your salt and all that ya
""
""
oh okay
""
did you learn to cook before you were married
""
""
oh no i
""
""
no oh
""
""
don't think i even knew how to cook an egg
""
""
oh so when did you learn
""
""
uhm after i got married
""
no my husband is
""
""
both of you started to starve
""
""
fated to cook
""
""
oh
""
""
no he's a good cook
""
""
oh your husband is a good cook
""
""
ya he's quite encouraging so he started off uh
""
started off started me off on some recipes and then
""
""
actually it's quite fun you know
""
i mean i do enjoy cooking
""
""
ya ya i i love cooking
""
""
it's just aiyoh
""
""
now
""
""
ya when you get back and you're very tired
""
""
uhm
""
""
it becomes a chore but actually cooking is so fun
""
""
ya
""
we used to cook in uhm almost everyday
""
i think maybe except for about two three nights a week
""
""
oh
""
""
ya before the kid came
""
""
oh but now your mother-in-law cooks for you
""
""
no we just eat at her place once a week
""
""
oh that's right
""
you told me you would cook in bulk right
""
""
ya
""
""
oh
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
how about baby's food
""
what do you do
""
""
oh that's something brand new for us
""
""
you actually cook you know or or just buy bottle
""
""
actually i'm still trying to figure out what's best for her
""
but last weekend we went out shopping and we got a crockpot
""
""
oh
""
""
then we got a food processor
""
""
oh
""
""
so we're going to try new stuff
""
""
oh no
""
""
so that's my my my new interest
""
cooking baby's food
""
""
oh ya i feel like getting a crockpot too
""
""
ya i think  word 
""
""
because i've heard it's ever so easy
""
""
uhm
""
""
you can get a really nutritious meal
""
""
ya
""
""
uhm and have it cooking while you're at the office
""
""
ya
""
""
so
""
""
that's right
""
""
unless you get an electrical fire in the meantime
""
""
that's not likely
""
""
so how uhm is this the first time you've started using a
crockpot
""
""
uhm it will be my first time
""
i haven't used it yet
""
""
using the crockpot
""
""
ya
""
""
uhm
""
feel like getting one but my kitchen is so small
""
""
oh where're you living
""
""
we're living at pandan valley
""
""
ya
""
""
we just moved in a few days before christmas last year
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
ya we like it very much but uhm uhm no actually there are no
buts we actually do like it very much
""
i was just
""
""
is that your own place
""
""
ya we just bought it uhm last year
""
""
ya uhm
""
""
uhm oh now i know what i was trying to say
""
this thing threw me up and made me really nervous
""
i mean we like it very much but uhm sometimes we feel like we
don't get to enjoy it enough because uhm okay we're working the whole day
that's fine
""
""
ya
""
""
you know everybody works the whole day
""
""
ya
""
""
but then when we get back very often we have work to do still
so we're sort of
""
""
uhm
""
""
hunched over the macintosh you know trying to type things out
""
""
ya
""
""
or you know so
""
sometimes like the last weekend this weekend that just came and
went there was a chance for us to you know sit there and just enjoy being in
our own home
""
""
ya
""
""
you know
""
""
like cooking
""
""
ya like cooking and just looking out the yard looking out the
window and the you know the lawn outside
""
""
uhm
""
""
so we really enjoyed that a lot ya
""
""
ya
""
""
but i guess it's not that bad lah to at least like your home
a lot
""
""
ya
""
""
even if you feel like you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
you wish you had more chance to just sit there and enjoy it
rather than tearing around all the time trying to get things done
""
""
ya
""
""
anyway i must tell you about the first time i cooked for my
husband before we were married
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
okay he was my boy-friend then
""
""
ya uh huh
""
""
and what happened was it was so funny
""
i wanted to impress him and at that time i was in the states you
see
""
""
uhm
""
""
so oh
""
okay i bought cooking
""
i bought this book entitled uhm chinese cooking a to z or
step-by-step or something you know really simple
""
it was so funny i followed it practically step by step but took so
long to read each step and the similar instructions you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
before i went on to the next one that things just went crazy
like the first step was to heat up oil in the wok
""
""
ya
""
""
and let the oil heat up before you throw in the garlic you
see
""
but i took so long reading the next few steps that the oil kept
heating until when i threw in the garlic the garlic simply went black
""
""
oh
""
""
ya everything was terrible and i didn't know that you had to
separate broccoli into flowerets you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
you have to slice off the stem
""
""
did you put the whole thing in
""
""
i just i mean broke off great big chunks you know and i
didn't know you had to
""
""
yeah
""
""
chop off the stalk  word  and there was
this great big green things you know uhm trying to cook
""
and i didn't know that it mattered which part of beef you bought
you see
""
""
 word 
""
uhm uhm
""
""
which cut of beef for es especially for stir-frying
""
""
ya
""
""
you should try to buy steak
""
""
uh huh
""
""
you shouldn't just buy cube beef or you know stewing beef
""
""
ya ya i'm not very good at that either
""
uhm
""
""
i've bought stewing beef which just because really tough the
whole time to stir-fry it
""
""
uhm
""
""
so that was really a meal to remember
""
you know the broccoli was great big chunks the garlic was all
black
""
""
so was he impressed
""
""
and the beef what
""
he kept saying not bad not bad but i noticed he didn't eat very
much except for the rice
""
""
uhm
""
""
ya so but i've come a long way i think
""
""
ya what do you cook now
""
""
uhm my husband's favourite is mango beef
""
""
oh interesting
""
""
oh it's really delicious
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
it's supposed to be a cantonese dish you know but i haven't
uhm met any other cantonese who who's heard of
""
""
i bet it's a cantonese dish in those easter uh no western
eastern type of cookbooks right
""
""
oh western eastern
""
well it was written by a chinese lady
""
""
who's been at the west
""
""
in the states for a long time
""
""
ya
""
""
well she claims it's a cantonese dish
""
anyway it tastes really nice
""
""
oh uhm
""
""
it's just like stir-frying beef like you would uhm stir-fry
oyster sauce beef or anything
""
""
ya
""
""
but uhm the seasoning is slightly different
""
""
uhm
""
""
uhm you don't use so much oyster sauce you use a bit more uhm
all sorts of things
""
""
yep
""
wine and all that
""
""
dark dark soya sauce
""
ya a bit of this a bit of that
""
""
ya
""
""
some spices
""
""
uhm
""
""
and you actually cook the mango too
""
""
uhm
""
""
and it comes out really delicious
""
""
oh must get the recipe from you
""
""
oh ya ya i'll photocopy it
""
you you're not cantonese are you
""
are you cantonese
""
""
no i'm hokkien
""
""
oh you're hokkien
""
""
ya but i don't know any hokkien dishes
""
i mean real ones
""
""
oh okay
""
""
ya
""
""
well my cookbook gives all the
""
""
uh a dialect breakdown
""
""
i mean alleged you know provincial specialties you see
""
""
ya uhm
""
""
ya
""
so now my next great ambition is to steam a fish all by myself
""
""
oh whoa
""
""
i can tell you're impressed
""
oh
""
""
ya i normally do uhm well
""
it's a i i normally do the more western type of dishes
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
not because you know it's western but because
""
""
it's easy
""
""
it's very easy
""
so what i
""
""
oh casseroles and
""
""
that's right
""
""
oh  word 
""
""
i'll just dump everything into the pot and then put it in the
oven and it's ready
""
""
it's very convenient
""
""
ya
""
""
ya
""
""
so uhm
""
""
what sorts of casseroles do you do
""
""
oh all types uhm beef vegetables chicken stew
""
""
beef
""
""
ya beef casserole like beef stew
""
""
wait a minute
""
if you do beef stew it has to be done on the stove top right
""
""
uhm it can be done  word 
""
""
oh
""
""
i don't have any means
""
""
is this some muh original creation
""
""
i don't know
""
""
do you do cheese casseroles when  word 
""
""
oh ya we've tried that uh but not on  word
 pasta
""
""
oh with pasta ya
""
""
uhm
""
ya
""
""
 word  chicken noodle casserole
""
""
ya ya that sort of stuff
""
uhm but oh then the beef
""
then then it'll be minced beef
""
""
oh you mean actual minced beef
""
""
minced beef and then pasta and cheese
""
""
not not slices of of beef or anything
""
""
of beef
""
not usually
""
""
chopped up
""
""
when i do the uhm beef stew it's normally cubed i mean like
stewing beef right
""
""
oh stewing beef right
""
uhm
""
""
ya i can't remember
""
sometimes i guess i use the stove top but sometimes the oven
""
""
uhm 'a'
""
""
it's sort of cooked already and then i'll put it in the oven
ya
""
""
oh actually since you have a crockpot now you probably will
""
""
might be useful huh
""
""
'a' because my mother has a crockpot
""
""
ya
""
""
and the first time she did all kinds of stews using different
kinds of meats and they always came up wonderful
""
""
oh okay
""
""
ya so you'd probably find your beef stew really delicious you
know if you try doing it
""
""
ya i haven't thought of using the crockpot for stews you know
""
""
oh oh i mean it's the
""
""
silly
""
""
i mean it's the one you know thing typical dish for the
crockpot
""
""
right
""
ya right now i'm just thinking okay i can use the crockpot for my
baby food
""
""
oh no
""
""
so you  word  my mind is
""
""
rather expensive baby
""
""
oh she is
""
""
she is isn't she
""
ya
""
""
the last weekend we spent about two hundred dollars just on
her no two hundred and fifty
""
""
on
""
""
on her things
""
""
what things
""
""
we bought her a baby chair
""
""
oh
""
""
we bought her the crockpot
""
""
the food processor
""
""
the food processor we bought her a busy board you know
""
""
what's a busy board
""
oh oh the sort with the telephone thing and and all sorts of
activity type of you know whatever you call them
""
""
ya
""
right ya
""
uhm uhm
""
squeak thing and  word  thing 
""
""
it's a squeak thing  word  and this thing
and that thing
""
""
ya
""
uh supposed to stimulate the mind aid in baby development and
what else did we get for her
""
""
gosh
""
""
ya
""
food
""
""
food
""
""
ya milupa baby food what vegetable hotpot and garden
vegetable
""
""
oh my
""
""
canderole
""
""
oh my
""
""
here we are back at food again
""
""
 word 
""
well wait until you have your third or fourth
""
""
oh no i don't intend to have a third or fourth
""
ya
""
""
uhm
""
""
when are you going to have nuhmber one
""
""
nuhmber one  word  oh me
""
""
ya
""
""
uhm let me first deliver my bouncing baby phd and then
seriously actually we're just waiting for my phd to be over
""
""
when do you expect it to finish
""
""
well i'm going to do my best to try and get it done by
january
""
""
uhm
""
""
uh which isn't as much as it sounds because i still have
other things to do
""
""
ya
""
""
i'm going to be preparing my courses my course not my
courses
""
""
ya
""
uhm
""
""
my course and then because i'm somewhat new at teaching it's
uhm i tend to have to over-prepare just to make sure that i feel sufficiently
confident
""
""
uhm
""
""
when i'm facing the class
""
""
ya
""
""
so i guess uhm it's a combination of all these factors
that's making me so terribly busy right now
""
""
ya can imagine
""
""
yes so the last thing i i can afford to do is to have a baby
as well
""
oh no
""
""
has your husband finished his thesis yet
""
""
oh ya he got his phd last year
""
""
uhm so yours is like on hold at the moment
""
""
uhm mine is uhm no it's not on hold it's
""
""
oh you've already got it
""
""
frantically under uh oh no i haven't gotten it yet but i'm
frantically slogging away at it
""
""
it's the last stages of the thesis  word 
""
""
i don't know what to call it uhm it's it's a question of
revising the first draft
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
but revising is a really heavy deal
""
""
ya
""
""
it's a really really heavy draining consuhming activity
""
""
 word 
""
yep uhm
""
""
ya because i mean it's so i mean your thesis has to be so
finely tuned
""
""
ya
""
""
and then and then uhm in an extended work when you change
anything because the arguhments and the line of reasoning is so intensely
involved
""
""
right ya
""
""
uhm you have to you know go through the whole thing and
start making changes you know and all the implications as well
