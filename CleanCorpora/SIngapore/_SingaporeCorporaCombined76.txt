each other before lah very fun tomorrow what time you play  word  who are you going with ah lip i don't know then i just assume they are playing then you just walk down there yah i mean do you i mean uh beginners not beginners you word  most of them are not beginners  word  sharon is quite good karan uh i have not played with karan and ming chee because when they are there they play by themselves how many tables are there there are a lot but some of them are crooked there are only about three or four tables that you can use but it's enough uh because if you play doubles more than enough  word  no need lah they provide the net you just get from s p e but it must be a good net i'll bring own bat yah you can bring your bat i used to play very often in the hall that means you're quite good what pick up in the hall no the like from my lit class there are guys who play and another girl uh margaret quite big sized actually our pastoral care pro class eh there are a lot quite a few lah that can play who are they one one of them is my friend vick lee he stay in uh temasek hall last time play for the hall lor play for the hall ah then ah another girl i i don't know her name long straight hair she play for word definitely she play for my word  that means you're quite good what  word  can lah is this the girl you're talking about yah yah sharon's friend right yah aik leng aik leng ah the other girl also plays uh table-tennis but she's a bit slow not very alert in ball sense aik leng has very good ball sense that day i played tennis with her she knows exactly how far to move back for her to hit experience no but she's not i mean she's not a good player but she she can you know gauge the distance usually this kind people ah is a very good word yah aye but surprisingly ah zul zul cannot play ball games i can't also what for me is like building up okay lor it's finally i mean slowly lah zul maybe because she doesn't expose herself zul is mainly a static word sort of but she is very serious right i mean like i play games my my motive is to enjoy myself her motive is what to but she does enjoy i mean she enjoy pulling weights hah i can't imagine myself enjoy pulling weights  word  maggie is that of like uh systematic building up like uh do my arms do my stomach yah i quite i find it quite boring lor sit down there or stand down there in the room and it's keep repeating you see it's repetitive it's repetitive you see yah so word  then you train for this muscle and then next one yah then must plan one you know yah when i do sports i never plan i think it's good lah to do a word  people like me so skinny no but that doesn't mean you're not healthy what true true okay i think maggie is quite weak maggie is quite quite weak you know when i look at her like a bit fragile uh frail like even she's thin lah maybe that lah like even teresa she i know she jogs she plays tennis but maggie swims what but i heard she said she got dislocated before right doing what doing word i don't know what lah she was just probably that's why she didn't play uh dangerous games lah better not wait come out but not long she told me before she has a screw inside her arm ah you mean it hasn't been removed uh no so when she go and take x-ray then see the screw but normally they remove it after like two years probably once you fix the your own skin word position because word i dislocated my elbow before so uh okay lah i mean once lah to other people hah if you dislocated once then it it'll occur very easily yah prone to it  word it will come out yah you'll be more prone to it so maybe she is this case lor that's why she needs to word  my father had an accident last year a motorbike accident so the leg got hurt had to screw uh the bones i don't know where i mean i think it was ankle he was on clutches and everything cast in a cast bad uh yah it was very bad i tell you uh that time in the hall then this inter-block game or inter-hall game but i can't remember my friend he's in the rugby team he broke his leg you know it really broke you know rush to n u h then that time we went to visit him just one yah then we dare not tell his parents so terrible it's terrible you know word  no my friend uh during the orientation sheares hall you know what they did they they you know they carried her uh hands limbs and yah and swung to throw her you see throw her forward so what happened was she landed on her face you see and she broke her two front teeth but she was so upset you know and and the thing about her is that we have always you know talked about how nice a smile she has and then poor thing like she was really upset oh dear but in the end sheares hall paid for it lah i mean she went to n u h to fix it the hall paid for it or the those those people who  word her i don't know but anyway it was paid lah but it was so terrible i mean yes no it can't be seen nah they just added just oh chip off lah yah so sad i think there's another friend of mine my neighbour when i was in my second year also played with rugby and he got fits you know rugby is very rough right people word ran and pound on each other right so what they stood up word my friend was lying word  just lying down there and then foam oh my goodness so a bit of foam coming out then we dare move him because we don't know whether we might broke his neck so we dare not treat him
