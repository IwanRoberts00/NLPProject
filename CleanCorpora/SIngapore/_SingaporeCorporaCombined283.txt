 introduction  1 at the teachers' day rally last september prime minister goh chok tong outlined the challenges to our education system a key imperative was national education many singaporeans especially pupils and younger singaporeans knew little of our recent history they did not know how we became an independent nation how we triumphed against long odds or how today's peaceful and prosperous singapore came about 2 this ignorance will hinder our effort to develop a shared sense of nationhood we will not acquire the right instincts to bond together as one nation or maintain the will to survive and prosper in an uncertain world for singapore to thrive beyond the founder generation we must systematically transmit these instincts and attitudes to succeeding cohorts through national education we must make these instincts and attitudes part of the cultural dna which makes us singaporeans 3 the prime minister set up a committee chaired by mr lim siong guan to study how to introduce national education into our education system the committee has worked out a plan to do so to take the next step forward we need the full commitment of every teacher and principal national education is not just a book subject it must appeal to both heart and mind unless you are personally convinced of its importance committed to the cause and have the knowledge and passion to teach national education competently and whole-heartedly the plan will fail  lessons from other countries  4 singaporeans are not unique in needing national education other countries take national education as a matter of course japan is a tightly-knit cohesive and group-oriented society with a long history and a strong sense of unique identity yet japanese schools start early to teach pupils japanese culture values history and geography and even the politics and economics of japan as pupils get older they also learn about the cultures and histories of other countries in so doing they understand even better what makes them uniquely japanese 5 japanese schools go to great lengths to instill group instincts and a sense that every student is an equal member of the group they have strict regulations on school uniforms school bags and shoes students are grouped into teams called 'hans' members of each han play together and eat together they take turns to perform specific responsibilities whether it is the daily cleaning of school premises or serving lunch academically stronger students are expected to help their weaker friends those who do not are ostracised students organise the school sports day themselves competition is based mainly on team events there are few or no individual events all students participate including those with disabilities 6 japanese schools do all this not because they believe that all students are the same in every respect or have identical abilities but they want every student to be equally valued as a member of the group recognised for his strengths and for what he can contribute to the group and so it goes for japanese society 7 in us schools every child is taught the american heritage george washington the declaration of independence the us constitution the civil war and the civil rights movement students take part in community service learning to be a responsible citizen begins young it is a deliberate inculcating of american political and social values and ideals to ensure the next generation grows up with these ideas deeply ingrained it is a process of indoctrination like any other no less so because the children are brought up to cherish american values of individual liberty and it is so successful that many americans are completely convinced that american values are universal values of mankind 8 if countries like japan and the us with long histories and deep roots have found it essential to pass on national instincts systematically from generation to generation all the more singapore a young country barely one generation old must make a concerted effort to imbue the right values and instincts in the psyche of our young  objectives of national education  9 national education aims to develop national cohesion the instinct for survival and confidence in our future we cannot offer our next generation any fixed formula for success or even any set goals in life they will face new circumstances and problems they will need to think through and work out their own solutions but we must equip them with the basic attitudes values and instincts which make them singaporeans this is the common culture that will give them a shared perception of life and draw them closer together as one people when confronted with serious problems this will give them a well-founded faith in the country's future this is the dna to be passed from one generation to the next 10 there are four elements to achieving this objective 11 first we must foster in our young a sense of identity pride and self-respect as singaporeans this will strengthen their emotional attachment to the nation and their sense of rootedness we are proud of our country we are proud of what we have achieved together - our economic progress our clean and green environment our open and clean system of government our way of life we are proud that each of us in his or her own way contributes to singapore's success 12 but success must not lead to hubris we must never be over-bearing or arrogant or look down on people from other countries we do not have all the answers for ourselves much less for other countries but neither have we any reason to be ashamed to say i am a singaporean in fact quite the contrary 13 second our young must know the singapore story how singapore succeeded against the odds to become a nation national education is not an abstract sermon on general principles of nationhood it is to do with a special story our story it is the story of singapore how we came to be one nation we did not start off with this goal or even as one people nobody imagined this would be the outcome 14 as a british colony from 1942 to 1945 for 3 and frac12 years of the japanese occupation we suffered a traumatic experience of cruelty brutality hunger and deprivation we lived through the post-war years of communist-inspired unrest and upheaval we then joined with the federation of malaya to form malaysia despite pressure and intimidation we stood firm in malaysia against the communalists the issue was a fundamental one equal basic rights and opportunities for all malaysian citizens under the malaysian constitution and no special rights for anyone in the state of singapore on the basis of race language and religion as was agreed in the state constitution of singapore as a result we suddenly found ourselves out on our own as an independent country with few means to make a living or defend ourselves yet we developed our economy built up the saf educated and housed our people got them to work together and gradually became one nation year by year we transformed singapore into what it is today 15 knowing this history is part of being a singaporean it is the back-drop which makes sense of our present it shows what external dangers to watch out for and where our domestic fault lines lie it explains what we stand for and believe in and why we think and act the way we do it gives us confidence that even when the odds look daunting with determination and effort we will prevail 16 thirdly our young must understand singapore's unique challenges constraints and vulnerabilities which make us different from other countries singapore is not as other countries we will always be small we will always worry about our water supply we will always have to work harder and do better than other countries that is the hand which geography and history have dealt us overall it is not a bad hand nor have we played it badly we have compensated for these constraints by being more resolute and resourceful more efficient and productive and quicker and nimbler than other countries which are better endowed and have larger margins for error and we have been so successful that sometimes we forget that the underlying realities endure and have not gone away singaporeans need to understand these realities to work together and support the policies that are necessary to deal with them 17 knowing our constraints should make us more determined to overcome them it is no cause for despair we overcame more severe difficulties in our first years of nationhood with far fewer resources and in more dire circumstances we are much better placed to tackle them now 18 finally we must instill in our young the core values of our way of life and the will to prevail that ensure our continued success and well being our core values include the system of meritocracy which guarantees fair and full opportunities for all multi-racial and multi-religious harmony and honest and competent government working for the long-term interests of all singaporeans we often take these for granted because things have been this way in singapore for a long time but not new citizens who often come with fresh direct experience of very different societies pupils must learn to treasure and uphold these social and political values if we ever lose them singapore will quickly become a very different place  strategies  19 we need to develop national instincts among pupils at all levels national education will begin in schools and continue in post-secondary and tertiary institutions after ten to fifteen years of education all students should know the facts about singapore and feel attached to singapore their best home those likely to go on to play leadership roles later should at least have had some preliminary preparation for their responsibilities we will achieve this through both the formal and informal curricula  formal curriculum  20 we will introduce national education content across the formal curriculum we can do more of this in some subjects than others the main subjects will be social studies and civics and moral education cme at the primary level history geography and cme at secondary level and the general paper and cme at the junior colleges in addition literature and the languages can also be used  subjects at primary level  21 in primary schools we will start teaching social studies earlier beginning from primary 1 instead of primary 4 social studies will complement civics and moral education cme will emphasise teaching of values and correct individual behaviour while social studies will give pupils an understanding of singapore society 22 pupils must start early to learn about the society around them to feel a sense of belonging to family school and community to befriend and accept pupils of all races and to develop a simple unabashed pride in singapore they recite the pledge sing majullah singapura and recognise our flag later they will learn the meaning of the crescent and five stars but long before that when they see the helicopter flying past with the state flag on national day they should sense that it is a very special occasion  subjects at secondary level  23 at secondary level students currently learn the history of our independence period only in secondary 1 the 'o' level history syllabus stops in 1963 which perversely omits the vital period leading to our independence we will extend the 'o' level history syllabus for singapore to 1971 the period of merger separation and the early years of independence will also be taught in secondary 2 instead of secondary 1 so that the students will be a little more mature and appreciate better what was at stake 24 at the upper secondary level we will develop a new social studies subject it will cover issues central to singapore's survival and success our principles of governance the strategies that have brought singapore here the role of key institutions like the saf hdb cpf edb and ntuc and our future challenges  it will use examples from other countries to explain what works and what fails and derive lessons for singapore subjects at the jc level 25 in the junior colleges students should start to learn what leadership involves and to develop a commitment to serve society through the general paper and civics lessons they must acquire the sense that they can shape their own future and more important that it is their responsibility to shape singapore's future they must be able to think independently and rationally and reach informed conclusions about national issues 26 moe will take 3-4 years to implement the new syllabi as the school curriculum is already heavy we will make the changes without increasing the curriculum load we want the new syllabi to give teachers more time not less to engage in creative ways to bring issues to life for their students
