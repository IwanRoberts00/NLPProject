what did you what did you think about it i think i never expected it to happen you know because uh i always thought to myself that the mrt was perfectly safe and all that but i was so surprised to hear that that you know it actually crashed okay and there's a good thing that it crashed at the station and one of the trains was stationary stationary that's right but that shouldn't happen if the train is stationary why should the uh moving train you know collide into i think the time-table must have got mixed up maybe one train was the the the the first train was slower and second train was faster you know so somehow or rather word  happen 'cause it's quite frequent right the mrt yes i think in morning it's about three minutes intervals or something enough to crash word probably so boon did you take the mrt to work i mean to to i stay at eusoff college and there's a shuttle bus service i see i see well i don't take the mrt i take the bus so but i take the mrt home oh now you be with so hopefully it it will resume its service when at about five o'clock you think people will lose faith in the mrt now that this has happened i don't think so i think i think it there must be some some reason behind colli collision it cannot happen just all of a sudden like probably there will be a big investigation like word i'm sure there will when the the cable-car actually came down at sentosa there was this big in inquest right ya so probably the same is gonna happen now yes yes but luckily it was i mean one of the train was stationary i'm sure the the impact of collision may not have been very bad probably many of the people on on the train were students at nus because it happened at clementi in the morning you know i suppose ya but then the the the train was suppose to be heading towards jurong ya exactly so so probably more workers rather than students but it stopped at clementi you see so that means the students haven't got down yet so probably oh do they normally go to clementi station ya many many students go to clementi especially if they're from arts or from engineering right i see i see ya so probably lot of nus students involve in that crash there do you know they're gonna have it on tv at three o'clock this afternoon you mean it has become a some like some celebrity not cele word  i think they they they they promise a a kind of a report on tv so at three o'clock this afternoon there'll be there'll be two telecast one on channel eight and one on channel five so it's it's almost three o'clock now maybe we can get hold of if we can get hold of a tv we can listen in and see what's what has what actually happen this morning right right priscilla do you play any sports ah ya i i play squash and right now i'm trying to learn tennis with a friend of mine who is teaching me oh how how often do you play tennis tennis uh not very often when he's free uh then he'll teach me you see so uh okay what about squash do you play squash very often oh now i don't it's hard to get hold of a partner to play ya partner who's about the same level as you not too bad not too good you know that sort of thing what about facilities uh i try to go over to ie uh rather college of physical education because it's just across the road from where i stay eusoff college eusoff college ya do you have to pay to get in there unfortunately yes but usually we can also you know just go there if there's nobody using it's it's quite alright ya are are you very good at squash uh i'm not on the squash ladder or anything but uh just recreational play ya just recreational play what about yourself doctor chui i i don't play any i i do i used to play tennis and and the squash as well but because it's difficult it's difficult to find a partner who is who who's on the same level as you in in the case of tennis you find that if if you get a very good player you you find that you you picking up balls most of the time so now i i i i in my spare time i run a lot jogging and so on i'm still thinking considering whether i should participate in the end of year marathon oh the one up mount kinabalu is it no no no no it this is organised by mobil the annual marathon singapore marathon twenty-three k forty-six kilometres oh okay so i'm still considering very hard whether i should put in the the registration form but have you actually run such a distance before i have done a half marathon uh a few years ago that's about twenty-three or thirteen miles thirteen miles miles thirteen miles that wasn't too bad you mean you managed you did not walk i did not walk yes i i did run all the way didn't have to walk at all any ranking no no just a like you uh uh like you i'm just a recreational runner so uh you don't play any other racket games at all not so much racket games no just running only just mainly running ah how about swimming swimming occasionally you know when when i when i uh when it's too hot then i just think i'll just go for a dip not not so much like a serious you know no i don't swim laps so okay what what styles do you swim well breast-strokes or or free-style well i don't i i won't consider that really very serious swimming it's just like taking a dip taking a dip right okay i'm i'm a pretty serious swimmer i would say oh really i mean if i go into the pool i would like do laps you know and how many laps do you do uh maybe twenty twenty laps ya that's very good free-style twenty laps no uh breast-stroke but it's difficult to actually swim in pools because there are so many people there people keep banging into you that's right that's right ya so it's not very easy to actually swim laps i used to swim swim laps too but i find it uh uh like you say sometimes it's very crowded ya that's right it is very crowded in the pool but it's it's so nice to actually run and then swim you know i don't whether you tried that before you you maybe you run about i don't know how many k i i run about two k then i'll go back change and go down for a for a swim for a dip ya it's really refreshing have you considered the biathlon no as i said i ought you can swim and run but i think that swimming is usually done in the sea right the triathlon ya but there there there are different ways of i think some some organisations have the swim in swimming pools and they have done that before oh i see i object to swimming in the sea because uh i don't think it's very safe many accidents have happened in singapore and uh overseas as well i suppose if you're a strong swimmer you don't have to worry about that i'm a swimming pool swimmer not a not a sea swimmer that's very that's very aiyah i understand what you meant it's very different swimming in the pool and swimming in the sea because in the sea they've got currents and wave and all these stuff so it it can really put you off ya true anyway it's just for fun lah swimming and running and all these it's just for fun not not not very serious about it actually ya i i also actually teach aerobics presently oh do you ya ya ya where do you do that in eusoff college i'm actually taking a class uh once a week once a week and what kind of aerobics do you do high impact low impact step i'm trying to teach them high impact but uh the they are not that very fit right now but i think they will improve with time i see are you certified no you're not i'm not but i know i know how to do jane fonda's complete workout quite well with my eyes closed put it that way ya i see because i have been watching the video and doing it for about more than a year oh and i used to take classes in nus as well as outside oh do you ya i used to so now i'm trying to teach them as a favour actually not because i i'm committed to it but as a favour because they want to learn i see i used to take a a few aerobic classes myself too oh i see where where about did you well i i i've join this uh club outside so what type of aerobics oh well all sorts low-high high-low step step as well step is is pretty fun ya that's what i heard but i don't have you tried that no i haven't tried it because they they only teach it outside they don't they don't have it in nus in nus no i mean i stop going to the rhythmics club i see ya but the nus uh uh aerobics is actually uh ya quite is quite tough you know the regiment is is this conducted by students or instructed from outside students i see ya and uh but it's not bad you know a lot of guys come as well and really ya and you can see them panting and puffing as well so that i know that i don't feel guilty when i do that then actually step is quite fun but when i still remember very first step class and uh it's not that easy initially because you you you really have to concentrate on what the instructress's doing and it it it has to be you cannot think too much you just have to do it you step up and down the the bench and you you cannot concentrate i mean you cannot really uh if you if you try to think too much you you you get confused and you can't follow the class anymore so it it depends very much on on your spontaneity so you just have to do it but it's really fun it it it it's really fun and uh it can be very high intensity too you can really pant a lot and it depends on how many steps you take if you if you you can for beginners you start with just one bench one step then you promote you progress on to two steps on the other hand jane fonda's workout it's it's really fun because uh it's it's a dance workout as well ya so it's like that there's cha cha there rock n' roll and uh there's country uh so it's it's really interesting scottish dance and all that really scottish but i've seen a programme i've seen a video tape once but probably it's a different one different tape i i i if i've not mistaken she has a few tapes she does i think there's a there's one which is quite interesting the lean routine uh it also involving like modern jazz ballet you see  i see quite interesting actually but i suppose that's more for girls the guys will not they usually have guys in the video as well
