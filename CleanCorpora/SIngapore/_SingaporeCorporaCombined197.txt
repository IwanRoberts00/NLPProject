game between singapore and malaysia singapore in white caps are leading now by ten goals by nothing and it's malaysia at ten goals to one i beg your pardon malaysia just broke the guards about two minutes ago uh towards the first part of the fourth quarter and now singapore on the attack uh singapore has been leading all the way and uh they've got the gold medal sown up uh signed sealed and delivered so to speak malaysia needs to beat singapore to win a medal but it doesn't look like they're gonna do it trailing by ten goals to one and now it's uh malaysia back on the attack malaysia playing from left to right in the blue caps and that's number seven choo keng soo with the ball looking for an opening james tan james tan tries a long and singapore right on attack with number six there aw kam mun one on one with the goalkeeper it looks like a penalty shot high low he was just a little bit too complacent there one on one with the goalkeeper aw aw kam mun and he just could not convert that would be a a nightmare for him for tonight he could have scored that goal but fortunately it's not a crucial goal it may just make no difference even if he scored it or not and it's lim teik yin with a free throw and the cap has come off and we are very honoured uh this afternoon to be uh to have the presence of none other than president wee kim wee and of course uh we are also very very honoured to have our prime minister here with us as well as doctor yeo ning hong you're watching with great interest this final game and goal scored by matthew oh number six aw kum mun goal number eleven scored by aw kum mun of singapore and we are in the fourth quarter of this waterpolo game and watch that goal scored by aw kum mun very nicely done and as i said earlier singapore has already won the goal medal this game is academic even if they lost this game they would still win the gold medal but malaysia has to beat singapore by at least three goals to secure a silver medal and malaysia who's on the attack even with the goalkeeper coming way out to the ten metre mark tiong siong pew being swarmed by singapore defence franklin tan a throw for franklin and number seven choo keng soo wins a free throw and another goal scored by tan kan ghee eleven to two both goals scored by tan kan ghee cap number two of malaysia and the scored line stands at eleven to two in favour of

matthew and singapore on the attack daniel wee daniel wee is trying no he's given back to matthew and matthew tries matthew tan the captain of the singapore team scoring goal number twelve making it a round dozen twelve two singapore leading in this fourth quarter of the waterpolo game i was afraid that uh singapore might be complacent uh at the beginning of this game but apparently not there's less than two minutes left in uh this whole wa waterpolo match between singapore and malaysia and singapore is leading twelve to two in the fourth quarter mass confusion in in front of the singapore goal an ejection of matthew tan no it's daniel tan his first ejection for first word  foul lee ding tiong tang khoon ghee choo keng soo ding keong good attempt there by number eight tiong siong pew scoring goal number three for malaysia matthew tan with the ball and being harassed by number twelve james tan fong ho yin the last minute of the game one minute warning being given and can singapore make it number thirteen eighteen seconds left in the goal word and yes number five ho wei meng has made goal number thirteen for singapore singapore leading thirteen to three not much time left in this waterpolo game with forty seconds left and uh malaysia will probably make a fast break of it even the goalkeeper has come up look at that goalkeeper has come up to the halfway mark and they want to try to score another goal but i think singapore is gonna deny them of that and they try to yes tiong siong pew trying very very hard there and uh singapore's gonna let the clock run now i think uh i think less than twenty seconds left and uh that is the end of the waterpolo game between singapore and malaysia singapore winning thirteen goals to three and uh we have a host of v i ps here at this toa payoh swimming complex our president wee kim wee is here our prime minister goh chok tong is here our defence minister doctor yeo ning hong is here and uh we're wondering who is gonna present the

and uh while we're finding out let's go for a commercial break and welcome back to toa payoh swimming complex as we witness the victory ceremony for the waterpolo competition singapore has done it again their fifteen goal medal in the series they have not lost one single waterpolo game in the entire sea games and seap games series there was no waterpolo played uh at the first seap games in bangkok in nineteen fifty-nine uh there was no waterpolo uh at rangoon for the second sea games but subsequently there was waterpolo uh being played at every sea games and seap games after that and this is the fifteen time that singapore has won and they have not lost one single game now that's a record for other sports to try to emulate president wee kim wee himself is going to present the medal to the winners and uh he's accompanied by defence minister doctor yeo ning hong that's cer certainly is a singular honour for the waterpolo team a proud moment for matthew tan and his boys all thirteen players going up the rostrum and that's matthew tan receiving the gold medal from president wee and that's lim teik yin major lim teik yin daniel wee very proud moment for the singapore players and doctor yeo ning hong assisting the president there's thirteen medals to be given away gets a bit tiring but that's a pleasant task nevertheless great moments for the singapore players they beat malaysia this afternoon by the score of thirteen to three and philippines wins the silver medal a lot of veterans on the philippine team i believe that's one player who's forty years old he's almost as old as i am proud moment for the philippine team as well it's a tough way to get a medal you've got five days of competition bruising word  competition at that i must say the waterpolo matches uh during this series has not been as robust as uh in previous games i've seen players coming up with uh missing teeth and scratches all over the backs and uh torn swim suits but uh this particular series the seventeenth sea games have been rather tame compared to other waterpolo matches perhaps all the other teams have resigned to the fact that singapore are the kingpins and uh indonesia wins the bronze medal in waterpolo president wee doing the honours this is indeed a very proud moment to receive a medal from president wee kim wee himself a moment that all the athletes should treasure for the rest of their lives and doctor yeo ning hong assisting doctor yeo the defence minister is also the president of the singapore olympic sports council singapore national of the council i beg your pardon and talking about that we have a lot of v i ps here mister ng ser miang the president of the singapore sports council is here mister s s dylon the secretary-general of the uh singapore national olympic council is here practically anybody who is anybody in sports is here this afternoon at toa payoh and a round of applause for everybody in particular president wee kim seng for bracing the occasion and the proud moment for the singapore waterpolo team a round of applause here from toa payoh and uh with that we go back to the studio for commercial break to be followed by uh a commentary on sepak takaw by mark richmond welcome to the singapore badminton hall for the inter-regu  word sepak takaw finals the gold medal match between singapore and malaysia the singapore trio of nor hisham adam mohammud rafi abdullah majid and ranji osmund against malaysia's world champions nordin sabarudin arshari hashim and rosli abdul rafman singapore down by ten thirteen in the first word of course remember they dealt malaysia a huge psychological blow in the preliminary rounds where they beat the same trio by two sets to love they qualified for this final by beating the indonesia trio while the malaysians overcame the thai trio in the repeat of uh the last sea games final ten thirteen down the first set and we played thirty-two minutes of this set so far the ball's gone out to illegal grounds and they refused to get now the advantage to two points the malaysians up as many as six at one time they threatened to take the set at thirteen nine but now they're faced with singapore serving at eleven thirteen with me is uh siram ohmar you've seen so far your comments your comments yes singapore started off slow four points behind and then they they allow the malaysians to get far ahead but they've settled down after quite a nervous start they've come back and they've even manage really quite well uh they just called back another point it's twelve thirteen singapore of course one point away now from forcing this just in this first set all the singaporeans were down by four love they came back to join level four all they were down by ten four they came back to reduce it to ten nine they were down by nine thirteen and now they have serve at twelve thirteen so really this regu from them have shown a lot of character helped a little of course by the malaysian word the takaw has gone out at time and the malaysians call for a time out the malaysians haven't really looked very impressive yet neither have the singaporeans to be fair but the uh considering that they are world champions and they have a very good chemistry between them the combination between rosli abdul rafman and the smasher chief smasher shari hashim hasn't been very good shari in fact has missed out on a lot of opportunities to kill the points off and in the block department both sides have had one successful block each yes uh singapore must uh keep their heads together they're only one point adrift they were like you said at times uh more than six points adrift they've pulled back well they've fought well and i think in the back of the malaysians minds' they will be wondering whether they will ever get to see the end of this because they just can't see it to finish off the singaporeans
