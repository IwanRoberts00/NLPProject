your your group ah anyone finish their a e so many a lot a lot of people finish already ya that is they are short of binding lah never bind yet at most ah final maybe final touches then how about your group your group ya me i'm the very slowly one no your group not only you how about others ah a lot of people finish already your group leh my group meaning what what group the ones in our core ah your discussion group nobody has finished rest assured our group all very slow they're all slow coaches i think you're wasting tape not mine tape is not mine they gave it to you ah ya this one ah it's not my tape how many have you done so far hah how many have you done so far this is the only one so i mean you need oh a pioneer set ah each one do one only is it ya this one i have to return seok mee and this one consider as ah for word tutorial ah interesting i'll tape the class lor who came up with this the department quite stupid lar not very well done ya they should know the answers what so stupid want to meet my doctor like you see doctor i mean if go and see chinese sin seh i mean y i h eh i only talk in hokkien than and furthermore uh our target is not only grads is it hokkien there is those who huh not only grads ya also this one not only grads no but the thing is indonesia you can see the middle age ya middle-age man the thing is eh if for example like grads eh you do not touch on the more common areas you know things like baby life kind of thing just hawker centres and restaurants that's it and taxis as you take taxi every day no they just want to know what language what language you use more commonly they should have asked what language we use when we slot the coin into the you know sometimes ah depends on the bus driver they ask kwe lui of course you answer ngoh kak what but normally we won't say how much we just show ya or they they usually don't ask either no sometimes they can't see you see the coin is hidden or some so they will ask i think they ask in hokkien you go and answer in english ah then not very nice they don't like it i don't think they don't really like as if you can't speak their dialect are you going to send out all these surveys or are you send out hand in ya or else how do you or else how you are gonna get those middle age people to answer them ah get it ya i got it i must say whoever is listening to this tape will get this which country did you say what do you mean you're sending this i don't know it's going to be sent abroad ya and i don't really know where my voice is going for that matter not really this one i'm i'm suppose to hand in by today how many you're supposed to do actually i need only i only need two word  then why are you doing two kay poh how expensive the rest got to do it my own lor there's a conspiracy going on which i know about uhm really not going ah no i'm sure to sleep there that's what i'm worried about actually i might as well do something productive that means you want to skip the lecture you also cannot cannot if i skip also then nobody is going to go there you you send one rep aye just like the case of last year that time at first so many then we count so boring the lecture it's not terribly boring i don't think so it's just that the voice or tone he has the the tone of voice he adopts who is the lecturer no no cannot say why should you destroy his reputation he's an internationally known figure okay who who word  and furthermore he's yet to grade me right no lah it's not that he's really marked you know it's just that the tone is too monotonous right after a while you it's just like one of the chinese lecturers really hah you know that what what's his name now there's another conspiracy that i know about i think he's uhm he's he's very nice person when he speaks he's much better in tutorials actually  word they all not impress uhm are are you going probably on our behalf must be lah or else he look around and can't find me and then what borrow your your tutorial to record ya it's a good idea word taping taping no i don't think it works very well and it takes time to to listen you know word  to do the transcript decipher ya but actually nothing to say right especially for econs lecture you just copy everything from transparency the thing is he doesn't have comprehensive transparencies the guy survives on two transparencies per lecture two transparencies if that is a good trans you know how he lecture or not dictation oh take out a book read read read read read full-stop all his sentences is very well phrased word  it's very difficult to to catch econs eh it's not language or others like history or geography no the thing is he he reads like he writes  word don't tell me that he just take out one textbook and read from the textbook it's not a text it's his own no it it it he prepared he prepared the thing you see but he reads the way he writes that means once we get hold of that book it's gone already just knock at his door sir may i have no he'll throw it at you literally throw it at you no it's just that i i think this is not a very suitable topic it's a very interesting topic you have any help this is what grads talk about all day interesting no i've always find him a very nice person you see when you have something he really meant you know so much it's just that he reads you see and that makes us very hard to copy down because by the time he gets to the middle of the sentence i just got to the middle of the sentence you've already lost it he could finish it but we can't and the words are not simple that's why i said he reads as he writes when you're writing use symbols use symbols symbols like for example change you draw a tri one triangle no different no no this kind we are used to he use he use bombastic words ah so how you change it to symbols bomb draw a bomb i think more time to draw a bomb then to write the word actually for example he says something that you are not very sure about the word lah then i don't how to say is you try to form the words lor no actually actually we know the words most of the time we know you see we can't it's just that we send it takes so much to write the word make it short lor the sentence is full of complicated words so you need to write all the words before that sentence can come out you cannot shorten it then it'll lose the meaning then shorthand lor this is the only solution yes serious why don't you just decide word to sneak into his room and sort of pinch the book a e also can't finish can learn shorthand aye do you know that i use shorthand for my chinese lecture do you know that everybody use shorthand no his is professional shorthand no shorthand for chinese i thought it's what we call short forms shorthand not short forms shorthand i don't ben word you prove prove you want to see my chinese lecture notes yes i would like to i think it's missing word  it's in a hurry it's not with me now next time next time don't worry there's always time i use shorthand you own set is it my own set what do you mean my own set that means i i your own shorthand aye aye i've got to go or else or else i won't be able to catch the lecture okay bye bye ya  she got to call up one of her boys uhm laughing  calling her boy her boy which boy tom dick henry it's not tom it's not dick it's not henry it's eng wah laughing  come on
