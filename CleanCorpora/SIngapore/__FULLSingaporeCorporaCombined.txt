difficult the church to get a church it's like those that allow us to book uh already it has been taken that day that's why ah it's actually i that's what siew hong was telling that you know book the the church as early as possible you know ya but then yet there are many churches that allow us to book but they only allow us to book three months in advance uhm you know that all the confusion so you have to make your list lah which one allow you to book which one can convey the order and now with the phone rates the phone charges you have to spend a lot of money on it lah so you try so i try to call as many as possible last week  laughs  uh try until saturday you know thirtieth of november  laughs  and it's not cheap you know i heard one place inter international baptist church they charges nine hundred dollars you know ah that one just for that afternoon ya and then uhm we wrote in but already taken up that day that we wanted actually they said still available you know so by that time we we write in our letter two weeks later already taken up maybe it's also good that it's been taken up so costly uh nine hundred but on average about four hundred five hundred dollars both lah the

five hours travelling and waiting i left my house at one met in school at two suppose to meet at two then some students came late you know came about two plus almost three so we left west coast lah at three then we travelled uh okay we waited for a long time for fifty-one after that took the train then up till eunos uh the train broke down aiyoh ya so waited you know they say half hour later the the train will be ready to go to pasir ris but didn't you know so later on we we took a bus and it was raining ha pouring that day so we didn't reach pasir ris until five-thirty your and and it was still drizzling and raining your picnic is suppose to start at uh uh about three but all of us were late ha and then there're there're the first batch that reached there they'll waiting for us because they don't have all the charcoal and everything poor thing anyway raining they can't even set it up then after that it was drizzling they so they tried setting up you know they would hold umbrellas all over shutting in the the pit ya then after that about six-thirty my friend and i we left ha how come your without eating without even smelling the fire how come your go all the way to pasir ris where you could have west coast ya lor because uhm ya they couldn't get they fully booked at west coast so they could get it but pasir ris not bad you know their new park just beside ntuc quite nice quite nice then the the sea part is quite ah the beach is quite broad also ah different from west coast because west coast is very crowded right all the ship and all that over there is very clear so it's good ya lah so that day was the last then i i won't be going down anymore for their the other teacher has taken over she has taken since she join in july but she's away now in the states so we just leave it to them on their own nah to carry out whatever practices your lunch is until two anytime two so you'll be back at counter or office tomorrow i've got a tutorial to give some to to students uh which group teach them uh english language students third year students ah ah so teach them uh the library how to use the library the catalogue how long is the session one hour uhm so i've to go and go back and prepare one hour ah ya so quite i think quite a lot of things to teach tell them even the catalogue itself there's so many things to tell them it'll be held in the library ya so then we also have the cd-rom cd-rom ya it's those computer is all the data in the computer readable format so you go to the machine cd-rom uh it's like uhm music those music disks like that you see but all is data so you just slot the whole thing in then you search let's say you want journal articles and all that for a particular subject you can do it there's only one one tutorial class is it uh we have a series for this uh this session for third year students but uhm the response isn't very good oh it's voluntary uh suppose to come the students suppose to come but then uh the other time i had a philo lecture one student turned up ha terrible eight or nine of them you know that kind of thing but you have to that means you've been giving lectures uhm on and off not not all the time but next year there will probably be more because we're going to have uhm sort of teach them link up linc the terminal the computer catalogue for all the first year students if possible third year students as well so there's going to be lots and lots of things to do ya so and then fourth year students also going to have a more in-depth one one to-one type when they do their academic exercises ah we'll help them on their topic so i think right from aug july up to i think one whole term first term will be busy all the time so do you enjoy giving lecture because there's something i know rather than let's say if i were to give a lecture to all teaching staff or or or you know those experts ha then of course i'm or or you you you you have to do that also no i don't for those teaching staff they as and when they come in a new staff we'll do brief them ya for that one-to-one basis yah that means we make an appointment with them ask them to come to library uhm for let's say one hour or so we'll just show them how to use a catalogue show them all our library bring them to the different department tell them what to do and all that you know most of the lecturers not almost depends on department like some new some new lecturers and all that lah when when when it come and then make an appointment with them then i know them by face and all that others is like based on what i know is as an undergrad then i'm suppose to do uh estate management architecture do this blur you know that day one one lecturer came and ask uh uh ask me to help him lah so i went then i don't know i can't really know the subject you see so i can't not that he ask me certain questions i'm not very sure about what how to look up for it also so it's uh a bit difficult for me let's say if i do geography at least  i know because i studied studied that subject before so anyway i try to smoke my way through  laughs  oh you mean you bring him to the shelf uh ya bring him to shelf and know like uh like depends on what because different aspects let's say of architecture and all that you see so i wouldn't be that sure lah better go two o'clock already ya

genting it's about like six seven hundred is it ya six hundred and seventy very cheap 'a' that's very cheap ya very cheap through the newspapers or what ya through the new no i went through the tour agent here the sats sts the one the one at the staff centre mm mm is that a special price for staff or what no it's not but they will arrange it with you uh the tour agent which is genting oh that's very cheap you you didn't go there by coach did you i fly by airways to bangkok and then and then uh coach up to chengmai oh the rest would be coach ride overnight and then back to singapore fly from bangkok orh that's not so bad but the trip from bangkok to chiangmai how long does that take a trip from bangkok to chiangmai about uhm ten hours oh my goodness overnight cheap oh oh but what about the hotels hotel is good how many stars three three to four stars four stars you have your own bathroom and then they provide you with twin-sharing rooms things like that twin-sharing rooms twin-sharing ya that's not so bad actually you're thinking of of of bangkok it's highly recommended ya but i wanted bangkok with chiangmai with nothing in between i didn't want one with pattaya and and chanrai and all these funny funny places oh but it's chanrai all these places that is good really i thought chanrai was nothing much oh we went to the we were going to the border and then to see all those tribal people did they offer to sell you no have you been there no never just bangkok ya just remember the traffic jam that's all ya traffic jams you tried the you tried that the the toot-toot or something right yes but only tried in chiangmai because the rest of the places we've got were were shifted by the coach oh but did you get to stay long in each location no no i think it's quite enough for bangkok how many days altogether but i extended three days up in bangkok to do shopping oh how nice ya sounds like my kind of person  laughs  how long was your trip actually eight days i extended to eleven to eleven ya another three days in fact four days for shopping you weren't alone were you no i went with my mother and then we stayed at a friend's place in bangkok orh then that's not so bad but the goods are quite disappointing oh why 'cos all rayon material you know the the i couldn't find any silk or cotton linen material strange did did they bring you to the shopping alleys and all that shopping alleys yes what do they call it but not the tour peo not the tour group uh this my friend who brought us to one of the shopping centres some quite expensive one we went we went to some cheap ones too aha the last time i went i remember they they brought us to this place which was a factory outlet you know oh yes you know hugh things so many clothes you could go crazy looking at them cheap but what clothes we were not brought to any of the what clothes factory it was all leather bags silver ware bronze ware things like that oh but that's that's fun too i like all this type of nonsense ya ya i like that did you go did you see uhm marcasite jewellery yes magaside ah lovely i was looking for it i want to buy it don't be like that i miss it it was uh in chai in chiangmai quite expensive you know i thought it was much cheaper there than here it's so expensive here i haven't seen any in singapore lots there's one at ah lim's art and craft they they sell quite a number where oh one pair of earring will cost easily twenty above oh it's about forty fifty dollars in singapore and i saw one necklace i like so much marcasite is one hundred bucks singapore not so bad what ha  laughs  i mean it's very cheap at this time lah there there's another shop selling very nice things you know marcasite uhm the other day when i went for high tea at parrots uh marco polo marco polo that's right there there's a shop on the way to parrots and they had some nice marcasite somewhere at tanglin is it ya ya oh then maybe you should go we're just standing outside and drooling at the pieces you know looking through the glass maybe you should go next june june july then i'll tell you what i want  laughs  maybe i should just go next week with siew teng 'a' that'll be good yes yes six hundred and seventy is not too expensive i'm sure siew teng doesn't mind she's quite rich after all we're just having our bonus oh ya do you know our money's in the bank i was told i haven't checked oh  laughs  oh have you been doing much shopping here no not at all oh because you just because not for the last i know that i'm going to thailand so i didn't want to shop i wasn't shopping for the last three months or so two three months so you just let it out in the big bang but i didn't buy much because i was quite disappointed with the clothes i was thinking of buying accessories and but then i was quite reluctant to part with one hundred dollars just for word  things like that what's the in thing there in thing at the moment in thing i'm not quite sure what is in thing i mean like the clothes what's what's in fashion lah couldn't really identify any fashion it's all the long sum maybe that's the in thing now i couldn't see cotton material quite plain it's just blouse and that's it ya but i still think that it's it's still nicer than what we are having here in singapore you know at the metro stores where they're having those back to sixties kind of clothes oh a line type is it ya awful right oh you like it oh oh oh  laughs  i like things here they are more colourful they are colourful but some of them are so so psychedelic you know it hurts the eye to look at it do you have an extra mug i've got four in my room if you want ah can i get one from you dr mak yes i want some water you want water yes you can go i'll get it later has it stopped the taping not yet or you want tea anybody wants tea oh no thank you okay brenda how long more do we have does it have to be twenty minutes solid okay what else did you go anywhere this time no i didn't didn't take leave but i i think i think i spent more staying in singapore shopping than i would have if if had it gone elsewhere where did you shop where do you do your shopping actually the worse thing about it was i didn't go to very many places i just specialise in a few shops and i just spend a lot in those few shops which made it even worse you know ah i i discovered this antique shop in chinatown point  telephone rings  and buying what and and they sell uhm antique jewellery so i bought a few pieces so you buy jewellery i don't usually buy jewellery you know not not it's not costume jewellery it's uh gold they told me was peking gold and uh i bought this bracelet a charm bracelet aha one day i should show it to you ya and it it's quite intricate you know and it's got these charms dangling on it and it's very well-made mm chinese you know it's ya chinese and i think that one is about twenty over years old and it had a little opium pipe uh a little flower basket you know in gold ah done up in gold and they had a little bird cage with a bird inside you must show me  laughs  uhm and they had the fish which moveable fish then they had the pagodas it was a earth pagoda and a uh heavenly pagoda one one towards the earth one towards the sky and uh how to put it now no no pendants but i mean it's it's quite a lot and it's quite huge you know and then i bought this pair of earrings dangling and it's got precious semi-precious stones oh yes i like stones but i don't know what those stones are and that one is about thirty over years old then different types of stones also quite damaging to the pocket then on top of that where else did i go there was some warehouse sales and aha are they worth going knowing me of course i go for such things i saw one yesterday there was a silk all the silk products in holiday ah oh at holiday inn is it ya oh silk blouse silk whatever but i didn't go i notice you're very into silk i like silk oh i only own one silk blouse in my whole life let me see i don't have much too i only have one this one and a creamy one that one is not silk oh the rest are not maybe this is the only one alright my one and only one i bought from hong kong - the washable silk some sleeveless you know with the different different colours they looks as if the watered the the water has run like painting ya and then uhm went for this one that's where we got the chocolates from there was a sime darby sale did you know the one along dunearn road i don't know just next to yeo hiap seng sime darby sixth avenue is it or where uh ya somewhere along there before the turf club chocolate sales no sime darby sale and in the newspapers they they said that they would have a lot of things uhm beds bedsheet bedspreads uh electrical equipment sime sime darby is good because i think they represent no no that's no but they they said they had a lot of things you know electricals tv sets toys and and food and everything ah should have come was it on the paper today no no it was on last week for five days i dragged siew teng with me that's where we bought lots of chocolates still on today till six tomorrow no it's it's over already so last few days ya then i went for the designer sale whoa  laughs  of course most of the things were like out of this world but they were really heavenly you know the clothes were so beautifully cut the the material was so nice but you know most of the people that you see there are are quite with their nose stuck in the air indonesian women you you see them you know with all their their their all the clothes piled over their their hands where is it this designer clothes oh ya did you buy anything just a belt for ninety nine dollars luciano soprani and when i brought it back siew teng and and dr teo was saying that it wasn't worth the money who's dr teo annie teo oh i see you know it had the luciano soprada logo in gold you know oh dear right in front rectangle all over the place all over the belt all along the belt and the one thing about it was this gold crest would fall off and i had to go and buy the super glue from from the co-op to stick it back you know so were coming off already i didn't i didn't notice it you know because what happen was was annie teo was looking oh brand name then she just tapped at it and it fell off then i looked at her i said ooh then she said not my fault not my fault ya i think it was about ten dollars worth and it got about six crests on it uh quite interesting there were other things also of course but not my size i think it would have been worth to look at it is it ya quite cheap quite varied i mean even though they were they were selling things for forty percent to seventy percent it was still too out of out of like what above five hundred no i mean like blouses two hundred and fifty dollars for just a blouse it's terrible i mean you won't want to pay two hundred and fifty for one blouse in the normal way unless it's silk then unless it's silk then then you could think about it one suit or one haven't got anything that's above two hundred yet yet mhm

is so terrible you must do reservist this this that aiyoh now i think i must really think first of migrating you know maybe i should uh submit my application even though it costs five hundred sing dollars to submit an application for australia but i think i'll i think that five hundred dollars is a good investment but the the relevant people may not be listening in okay so there's no point going on but i think if lim pin get out of nus uhm i think they might actually change the system he's obsolete is that what they call the observer's paradox what one of my uh lecturers in s p believe she said what can they what can they test a post-graduate student in three hours is it a fair test well perhaps true they're testing memory power rather than understanding actually that's quite true a lot about honoured you know undergrads memory powers those who can remember better but sometimes it's the facts you remember how you apply it in your answer you see but then i think it's postgraduate level it's more like research methodology rather than but then you should it by then you should do it by by thesis thesis how many words ten thou ten thousand for honours thirty i think okay thirty thirty that means only ten thousand words more you don't have the twenty not thirty twenty twenty i think it's twenty thousand no twenty is by course work is it i can't remember course work is twenty plus your nine units twenty k plus nine units so how to word  oh you mean yours you intend to do it for three years no no no it's fifteen months everything is crammed in three weeks so last time they had term last time they had last time they had term one i i i think i'm i'm quite awake now and then you take exams and you finish it finish with it ya ya ya ya ya everything is at the end you see ya accumulated so what is your area of research bilingualism and uh maybe i'll i'll look into either codeswitching or uhm how bilingual how the i mean we all differ in our speech of bilingualism is it too noisy it is too noisy rather noisy so how never mind i think try lah either that or we can rush through lunch worse worse worse after worse worse comes to worse we'll meet again for lunch maybe you should put this uh near your registrar's table and then tape and see what he says or go to her room or what you can do is rush through lunch and then go to her room and talk but you can't really rush through the chicken rice it's pretty good i can help you with it no you eat your salad and keep quiet so rude uh this fellow how is siew teng uhm tze peng tze peng how you pronounce word  ya tze tzy tzy is he happy at n p b ya he's happily married too to whom aye i like your card where did you buy it oh i'm sorry we're not supposed to reveal such things it's very nice because the edge has a book mark ya i have ya so you can tear it off so you can send send it back to her no it's on my table now no why why do so many people leave uh unlike uh four o one anthea doesn't leave she's like entrenched i think she's the only one who can teach that course or is willing to teach that course what course is that history of eng historics of english history of english historics ya it's a paper that will fail so you word the origins of english it's compulsory it's a core course compulsory course for honours year it's like word and word  are completely different but but he did it for his i didn't do that it's one of the i mean you can choose lah i didn't choose that an elective ha history of english in australia is an elective oh you did it in australia no it's not it's not elective it's like you have got a number of units to choose from so i wouldn't if it's really elective none of our courses are core courses so like we have got a number of topics we can just choose quite flexible ya ours we had to use standard english right for transcription and things like that uhm ya ours not necessary theirs no need you know but you where where did you do your u w a university of western australia oh u w a actually if you come into contact with these uh foreign lecturers they're actually very flexible they're not that particular because they all believe that you have been word  but the irony is that most of our lecturers are foreign lecturers in the lang department no it's it's policy over here yeh ya it's policy but sometimes also their style also word formal with their is certainly a style what i don't think it has anything to do with policies i can't i can't think of any locals where is she from a british lah just right behind you that floral the bluish floral dress back facing to you actually you know what i would like to study as a masters research something like uhm whether singaporean english is singaporean should be better classed as singaporean chinese english because i believe the malays and the indians speak singlish in a very different way malays yes but i think indians are more difficult to discern you know i mean distinguish but it depends it depends it it depends also it depends on their cultural context of course you get a very typical indian suh they will sound very indian right if you get those those those uhm less traditional usually like the christians and all that they are more modern yes yes yes ah like yourself lah ya do you know whether they'll then do a comparison you can ask me maybe i know you won't know what are you sure the bridging course started already started i told theresa ask theresa anyway it ends it ends in april i think march or april i'm trying to skip word  is is tzy peng applying for p r again he's a he's a p r but didn't he doesn't want a citizenship but he doesn't have to where singapore or australia here here here ya lah don't want nah what for not worth staying here i knew he doesn't want to do his doesn't have to do his national service now yeh if he but if he gets a citizenship no he doesn't have to oh really how come how old is he twenty-eight i thought he might still be liable you know because that wasn't one of the conditions when they offered him ya lah if not people won't take up citizenship what he doesn't want to take up anywhere because being a p r married to a singaporean there's nothing he need to he only gets to vote other than that he gets an increase lah ya and vote for what everytime p a p also win one have you ever tried the chicken rice here no have you ever been here no i've been to the lounge upstairs or downstairs i don't know had a drink there lah many many years ago i had rashes immediately after that when i realise i was allergic to alcohol so it's the first time well at least you never had a problem of being drunk ha i'll be scratching all over before i get drunk and it was only a singapore sling my friend she my friend had a liquor you know that that that kind which kind and it's it's a it's a what earl ladies and she was knocked out just after a single sip had to stay had to sleep for about one hour at my friend's place ya get knocked

do anything to it right i mean other than throwing it away no they can change the name and then oh please i won't be proud of those those kind of results nah lah maybe if we have calvin kind of results yes i will keep no lah my word but some people do that you know they have one case where they altered the there was a police case what a detective came to talk to me and what then got a shock he said special investigation asking me what did you want to do  word  do you have ai lan's number tan ai lan at home i've i know the new one ah she's married already you know the new one ya ya i don't have you have her new one is it brenda if not i have i might have to call her office and ask for it where's she working now i b m oh she's there doing marketing so i have to ask her something background  word  but i heard i b m is good is it they treat their employees very well but they just have world wide retrenchment kind of thing going to cancel my salad if it doesn't comes most probably they're still looking for your lettuce in the garden but jennifer's chicken rice isn't nice  word   word it's different from what it is today but one the imitation ya exactly but the imitation one is good at the the air-conditioned oh i think here word the air-condition 
Singapore	 29 december 1991  feel like counting used to the great price waterhouse so how was your trip up malaysia okay lah okay fives you want them oh ya ten dollars three dollars uhm this ones oh

to move okay okay so i leave that to you to come up with ah i think we'll probably just allow them to see any doctor ya okay i mean to have them to have this panel of doctors  i mean i i don't see any yeah no logic lah  laughter  yah any doctor and bring the the medical cert lah cert ya and the bill of course probably imburse them see any doctor after a certain amount for the year you know something like that if they don't go and see the word enough to word the medicines i was having a look at the  word  no no no even though the consultations uh free yah but subsidised at five dollars too much for probably save quite a lot if you open it up to any doctor  whistles   laughs  so chu keong how was uh oh cannot why why why oh he's not supposed to talk okay well brenda how was your trip  laughs  malaysians forgot what that was lucky i didn't say anything about that fellow  laughs  you are outstation why uh christmas ah why were you in singapore oh ya ya ya i only went before went to phuket where kuching where phuket phuket was it wet over there nah it's nice hot and sunny yesterday's rain was terrible ya ya ya is mary's leave uh finished or no she has taken nineteen and she's uh all leave it till she probably quit she's serious about it ya she wants to quit i'm serious about it oh you are  laughs  no it's not worth the stress ya so what is she going to do stay at home that's up to her to decide i told her to take a long rest better volunteer yourself your church service but the first day she's started yah but she's submitted the letter in another words no not yet interested in counselling training one two three four five six seven eight nine ten she she was saying that she wants to go to open university yah she already got this uh got this uh attending this course to uh to take law three four five six seven eight nine ten two three four five six seven eight alright pursuing a law course personal coaching there ah  laughs  mine is all practical  word  yah ten percent of what you learn in the university is applicable that is only for law but medicine is a different thing altogether 'cos that's a skill yah what you learn is what you practice law is entirely different but uh wonder if suzanne has switched yah talking to her su lian has gone to russia  word  and in anticipation of her arrival boris yelt gorbachev stepped down i can handle the problems of russia but not su lian the word of nus but i i i can't handle su lian let yeltsin do away deal with her probably she probably walks in there and says why must we be like that why must you drive on the right hand left hand side of the road malaysian currency is put yah put that side when'll she be back she should be on the food oh i see i'm sorry mary mary will be broke when is mary coming on the way yes merry christmas that day didn't have the chance to greet you that day you were at wesley hall right bye bye bye bye shouldn't tell him hey no no no what's that so it shows he doesn't  laughs  why did you become  the chief advisor   the chief advisor  a how come they covered the because of this morning because the children nah and then sometime word  word schools because of theirs hps the word one ah yah he's very particular about hp hp you don't know our hp ah hewlett packard he was our church hewlett packard who you don't know ah who really give high quality functional machinery hp think hp who is hp in our staff think don't don't think lateral think think simply  word  he's trying to think of characteristics one of the church staff uh one of the pastoral team members harriot ah harriot harriot word  yah two three seventy three six three ah yep sixty three cancel one dollars thirty five and this is one malaysian note not counted fives thirty five here coin thirty five thirty five fifty fifty uh want to add up these cheques all is fifty i didn't exceed okay dollars ten nine pieces how many word i got twenty one yah dollars fifty twenty one pieces twenty one piece hundred one piece so so when's mary coming back here she's on the way any moment i'm waiting for the pager to buzz and and pick her up from the i'll go and pick her up no on her way on her way back yah oh i thought i thought she's uh she she she went to what malacca what is this a holiday or just a look-see and shop alone with some small group members orh two other ladies malacca is quite a nice place for sure they won't have a doubt  laughter  does it tally or does it done by coach or by train or something coach sans tours so she can land up somewhere in that people's park or something like that no uh at kim seng and then she's the they're taking a cab to potong pasir oh and you pick up word  yah  laughs  what bus went near your place where do they where do they stay ah at the emperor hotel formerly the merlin lah that's in town itself right yah town itself she didn't want to stay at the beaches uh malacca or somewhere one day what oh one day only one day only ha aiyah left yesterday morning coming back today aiyah the way you talk like she went for three four days or one week that's why 'thot who was could have such a good morning that's why he said come back today i said a gone so long already why didn't she go longer oh  laughs  well it's only a one-day tour did then why don't you go with her why didn't i go because it was all ladies they are going and go and shop and one thing which i don't like to do is to shop but you can always go there and do other things what you sit auto and watch video or go to the pool and laze around stereo i don't know today suddenly we all seem to be so quiet you need you need some key players yah as though we felt that our voices will be recorded we need su lian su lian will probably say something like 'oh yes yes lah what do you want me to say and then she'll go on but these days you never know uh they could be recording your voices anywhere over the telephone ah yah even now while we are counting money ah word is it illegal ss not illegal lah i know the police and all that do that lah uhm but isn't that illegal it's illegal overseas there's no right of privacy here ha singapore ah yah really ah what do you mean no right of privacy at all you mean in the states they couldn't do that no they they  word  apparently they can tape your phone conversation and use it as a what evidence in court ah the only thing they can't do is give your ic number your your address if you write to word because there's a some uh section in the national registration act which says that whatever information inside there but they wouldn't know it's is private and confidential except to the authorities but then they have to prove that it's it was you on the phone nah easy what yah how probably get you to talk on the phone again and do a voice read uhm okay could you snore i want you to read this sentence i want you to read these these same words but how proof how fool-proof is uh how fool-proof is a voice yes not fool-proof you know you can never proof by uh signature yah the so forgery all that lah in singapore at least none of the i mean tech officers will go down and confirm that that is the writing of someone but this kind of things they will only do if it's something real serious like yah you you confess that you murdered someone or you posted to your friends yah no they'll probably send it to england and give someone to positively confirm as a word  yah as evidence yah so what is actually the amount of tapes they use yah so if you don't have right of privacy right you mean down here you don't need a warrant to walk into your house they need so there's still privacy there what i know but privacy in the sense of recording your conversations so there's no sanctuary not like in the old testament times where you can run to a village and then nobody can or run run to a church ah then how or run to your room why the sanctuary would would they arrest someone in the sanctuary i don't think they want they'll probably wait until so so you go you go there and you just sit there and sit tight you know 'a' in countries uh you are but then you charge uh an embassy they wouldn't go into an embassy what yah because neutral ground because neutral yah it's considered part of the territory of the other country the other country so so so would the church be neutral ground no the land still owns the government still owns the land yah yah embassy embassy no it's part of the but overseas it is isn't it yeh that's why you have certain cases like that word so let's say you rob a bank uh you carry a bundle of money like that you you know you run and police chasing you and you jump into the yah embassy f& the embassy the embassy'll probably find out that you are a robber and throw you out lah yah no they i mean if even in that sort of a situation if the police run in they i think they wouldn't they won't lah raise a fuss about it lah so by because at the end of the day you must see what are they going to do are they going to declare war or cut off diplomatic relations over you uh over a bank over a bank robber only yah we may we may do some diplomatic relations with russia ah yah su lian is there ooh i took it just so that i can donate to to the poor people in russia and russian will probably say something like buy food buy food for the poor children the lawyer probably say something like i don't know you know you don't know i don't know uh it probably saves in efforts yeh well this is the last session of the year it's very quiet session so aren't you going to turn it off

word  and this colleague was saying how they were they always carry a haversack and a water bottle you have a water bottle the yellow pump so is the it gets red when activated wait wait aiyah no lah it's not as to the content right so there was in the new new paper not in the new not not the straits times i was looking through it i don't know whether i i saw it in the new paper it's about this east coast park thing right how many got arrested arrested uh uhm huh really he's saying but what's wrong uh why because they were nudists because the the undercover cops went there and they got molested and they got fed up molested propositioned but why did they go there to get molested and then and then arrest people after hour recreation and then they were not satisfied they they can't arrest them if they were not molested uhm uhm so they must like open themselves to but it's okay what i mean unless there are rape cases reported uh were there were there not loud enough rape cases no right no no males got raped there right i thought they are quite you know mild people i told you about my encounter with them uhm ah ha this one why they claw on you a story worth telling ya what happened ya okay i told you before right i don't remember anyway i was cycling there lah uh which part which part tell uh it's near the end of the cycling cycling track uh the other end from here uh uhm i was cycling off the track you know there's one part where the cycling track is quite quite far away from the uh floor line uhm because of the reclaimed land there lor the last word the last drain the last drain you know there are several drains uh the uhm word word  actually get canal canal's going to the sea uhm okay the last drain before you reach the end there's one path word  there you know cycling there it's evening time i i don't know what was going on actually uhm just noticed a lot of males uh walking alone uhm you know so i thought there could be some kind of illegal activity going uhm i had no idea what exactly uh i was enjoying the place because it's nice ya nice bumpy areas i like bumpy areas uhm that's why he needs a i like bumpy word  that's why he needs a that rocking woman uhm ya then there's one part where i came across two naked men uhm ya probably they heard me coming along uh so they were both standing up one was looking very shy the other man was overweight looks like a typical towkay guy doesn't look like a gay at all towkay guy completely naked doing stretching exercises with a huge tummy so all you saw was where where where where where were they stretching exercises wait wait wait you actually saw his front nuh or or he was facing the sea and i came from behind him so he was doing stretching exercises where was he doing the stretching the beach is it they're both looking very self-conscious huh where oh where on the beach itself uh not that near the beach rather nearer the cycling track uh oh ya the casuarina trees or ya uh uh so at least not totally unshielded or anything but they were so near the that the crisscrossing tracks inside lah you know they're so near the tracks not discreet at all and uh why must they be discreet okay anyway they were very self-conscious lah obviously not real maybe still looking for new khakis uh not real exercising lah just or he could be warming up but i doubt it lah it looks more like you know very self-conscious and for the sake of doing something else just do some stretching exercise maybe just to pretend to this huge word tummy and they  word  that's that's when you're very near them lah if not horrible i cycled past them lah while he was doing this stretching exercise to the huge tummy and the huge erection wah and the right guy was trying to look away looking natural uhm a much smaller guy when you said encounter i thought there were something more to it like what happened to you i wanted to stay and watch but i thought it's not very decorous can watch what new new paper has said there're some people stay there and watch can uh can bring video camera along uh no lah why not a you want extra income right they like to be no lah i wouldn't be so mean why so mean some of these people are exhibitionists uh unless they are actually what i mean they stay so close to the track then then they allow people to watch them actually uh what are they doing maybe this' their way of you know attracting new blood lah right new blood uh uhm bo pien in hokkien did they make eyes at you uh you know any any no signs of you know trying to get you into  word  sharp eyes you've got when i was looking back he was waving little brother was waving at me 
Singapore	you know what i feel like what i feel like my students' doing the the interaction in the lab  laughs  you say what now uh you say or i say uh okay lah you say lah okay lah so how uh today what time you're going to cut your hair i thought it's five o'clock okay and i thought you're the one with the problem actually uh i need to go down because uhm i need to go down earlier because i need to drop my brother's uhm mug shot cid stuff you know with all his fingerprints so maybe i don't know do you do you feel like going down earlier too can no problem cos it's at it's at maxwell road it's pretty near i think uhm what do you you you just have to drop it or you have to go just see the guy just drop it ya but i've to call them first because the last time they gave me such a hard time why he wanted to know if it was male or female and then if i when i asked him for another one he said oh what do you want it for you know so i said oh just in case i lose it ya but why do you have to call them i mean because it says on the form ninth to twelfth ah but when i called earlier at about one something she said the office opens again at two so if they close at five then maybe i can drop it there you see oh ya nine to twelve and the officer is quite handsome also ah no i don't think i should go with you then i mean you can do all by yourself no lah it's okay because there are three there you see ah three men nuh three of them sitting there ya all handsome or not one sitting down uhm i don't know maybe they change shift but last time not bad lah oh wah not bad then if we have time we can go to the telok telok ayer uh street market hey ya you know what word said last night she says they have extremely good capuccino how does she know cos' she went there last week or the week before and it's called the coffee club too wah she beat us to it huh ya and she says that the cof the the cream is real thick cream and it's really really good but word  but you had your coffee for today already oh ya aiyah never mind i i i don't care let's go have it ya i thought of having it today okay lah and it's only two dollars or three dollars we can have dinner there is it ok ya i suppose ya ya we could do ya ah but i'm going to mark ya okay lah never mind i i you're going to mark for me i sit down and keep you company okay oh get out of here no no no ya can i don't want to mark i'm so depressed hey uhm for next monday can you tape martin soong for me please because he's going to talk about uhm oh what did he what's he going to talk about huh ya but the i've got a small problem here what my video tape is pengsank oh he's going to talk about something really important but i forgot oh anything he talks about is important to you ya so can you watch it for me and suhmmarise it no i can't because i've my class you see oh please huh okay lah i'll watch it if there's nothing better to do ya okay he's very cute lah no way okay lah so i shall watch it 'a' tonight is uhm women's choice must watch i don't know what the ha sbc's oh i know it's klute is it ya aha uh i think jane fonda plays this prostitute or something te-nen-te-nen hey when is sophie's choice i want to watch that i also don't know aiyah i missed last night's one ya me too okay uhm let's let's think about what we're going to do when we go to france shirley really uh huh what are we going to do what are you going to see in paris uh men okay besides that you're going to do something else i mean you paid all that money to go ya that's why oh aiyah why are you so insulting uh uhm i like it to be on record okay now hear this we prefer french men to singaporeans no we have to check it out first and ascertain that they are worth oops okay ya aiyah ya what shall we do well i don't think we have what what do you want to see in paris i don't know the usual stuff i guess we got to go see the effel tower i mean you can't go to oh i've seen it already so have i but never mind i'm sure the kids want to see it ya you know and anyway i think uhm word has pretty much planned what we're going to do for the day anyway for us ya there's there's a program for the day but the nights are the nights are free the nights are ours they're ours oh oh except that i think he's going to drive us to the disco oh really uhmh d-i-s-c-o suriya oops ya don't know lah i think i think okay it's more uhm what we're going to do after the trip like after we've ya sent all the babies home ya ya i don't know what i i just i want to do so many things i think we should write to ahrya ya i think so too and i think we should uhm but you see all that depends uh on whether uh we can extend our stay ya and that's what we need to know first i mean you know but i don't know i mean he seems so unsure about it ya and preoccupied too i think half of the time i don't understand what's you know what the whole thing is about so and anyway there's trouble in paradise trouble in paradise ya ya but uhm ya i i think i really i'd like to see ahrya and annu and uh annu and davi ya annu and davi and maybe uhm well definitely i'll like to hop over and see those guys and i'd like to go to baath this time i've been there so many times and i always missed baath baath yeh baath check up the baath uhm ya uhm i wish we could stay longer that's the problem when you have so many things to do bo lui leh oops no money no ya the problem is not the leave yesterday you know uhm annet annet kath and she goes where kath downstairs oh i thought maybe at the concert oh no ah that would have been interesting you meet everybody in the concert you meet kam you meet kath you meet tohini you meet ooh uhm ya well no no no i met her down you know in the canteen and then she was saying that uhm it's going to take ten thousand dollars for five weeks i nearly died what do you mean she says you need ten thousand dollars to stay there five weeks that's a lot of money ya she asked me you know how long i'll stay before i go work can't really afford to stay very you know for a very long time ya what's your budget nuh i don't know i haven't worked it out yet i think you should sit down and do it you know ya and then she goes oh you know she thought i didn't have the leave and then word that i've plenty of like five weeks i think she almost died ya i've got about the same too got about i think it's slightly less than you about five weeks hor ya i'll probably take a couple of days here and there you know uhm and then the rest it's open but i don't know i mean aiyah i don't know i don't know whether i should take it all there i don't think i can afford to much as i would like to uhm ya okay but the thing is we really have to find out you know whether uhm it can be extended because then we can think about whether we want to buy the eurail or the britrail or what rail ya ya or just cycle around the whole place i'd like to cycle in amsterdam you know your bikes will get stolen i know they only have a six-month lifespan probably less now before it changes owners and uhm yesterday utta told me it takes six hours to drive from uh just outside hanover to calais no not six hours ah where's calais france is that france france france french town uh ya you know the where you get the uhm ferry to go across to dover is that why they say calais word  i don't know ya so it'll be kind of fun uh ya if we could do it that way but ya you know what i was i meant to tell you this uh do you think uh i should knuckle down and learn how to drive a stit- shift car oh it's not six hours jacky it's longer huh stit-shift uh uh because is it cheaper to rent a stit-shift there uh i don't know never rented any thing others because if it is then i'm going to learn now really ya which car are you going to bash up jacky any one nuh oh ya i'm not picky what do you think uh ya go ahead or maybe i should uhm just rent an automatic the thing is i i i don't know you know i haven't maybe we should go down and get some brochures from the course ya because i can't remember whether it's cheaper to to take a train and then you know grab a bus or something i like to take train because you meet all sorts of people in them ya or to word drive  word you know you can share food and get to know them and who knows what might happen ya true true ya so we need to work it out lah rail versus car ya but the but i think the the good thing about the car is you know you just you have your bags in your car and your word  you know everything with you you don't you don't really have to dump them anywhere and i i mean the uk is no problem driving so ya and then we can send like postcard to brenda maybe ya ya you know say hi how are you wish you were here we'd like to converse with the tape-recorder ya maybe we should go and get uhm you know the brochures from avis ya and word and all those places  word how does the tune go uh keep on trying what is that trying we try harder avis ya avis you don't uh no we don't know another way no another way ah avis we don't know another way we don't know another way keep on trying avis ya hey federal express is in the red in europe really ya talking about these companies oh yes yes i'm sure very sad we're not going to hear we fly you ninety thousand don't know what don't know what ya ya ya they're selling off their their european uhm offices oh dear sadness some ya we'll go do that lah and then see how and if we wanna buy britrail we can just go to diners and get it from there  diners ya hey utta is going to bali in in nuhm really in nuhm in nuhm in nuhm when nuh april uh no august you know oh can we go with her yes then we could carry her bags or something i don't know you could try we could you know send off the touts ya hello darling how are you darling 
Singapore	okay can we start now uhm thanks uhm okay so uh lay kuan uhm uhm meng choo says uh meng meng choo wanted me to to ask you when you might be free so that we can get together and have lunch uhm uhm uhm when when will will you be free actually my good days are wednesdays and thursdays uhm uhm uh wednesday i finish at eleven and then i have nothing in the afternoon wow ya that's why i like wednesdays and thursdays i have uh till one o'clock and then i have nothing after that nothing after that does she have a fixed lunch hour well uh she's flexible uhm so so the only hitch is that uhm she she would have to arrange for somebody to look after her son uh if she go out for lunch oh oh i see so that's why we have to make arrangements beforehand oh i thought she always goes back for lunch does she no then i i what do you mean by having to get someone to look after it's as though she's back every time for lunch oh i don't know i really don't know what her arrangements are like okay okay uh but in any case uh well it sounds like thursday is a good time uhm uhm because uhm thursday is good for you it's good for me because i finish my lab class at twelve o'clock ah ah and then i don't start again until two o'clock uhm uhm so in between i have two hours so that would be a good time oh okay thursday meng meng choo was thinking whether we should go to the guild house uhm for lunch which one the the the nus guild house ah ah uh what do you think okay guild house is alright is she a member i think she is because we can't go in unless unless we're members or rather we can't eat there unless one of them one of them is a member i don't know if her membership has lapsed though but some time back ya i have another idea it's also word good it's also related to or associated with guild house uhm uhm uhm it's at adam road okay and just after or ya just after this bible college uhm there's a lane going to the left uhm there's a slope up to this uh colonial-looking house right right is there a restaurant ya and there's a restaurant up there oh i didn't know that ya it's very homely in that sense that it's it's those old fashioned house the chinese call it bukalau type of house you know uhm uhm and it has uhm it's wood uh wooden type of uh flooring uhm irene tan brought us there once uhm uhm and and is it terribly expensive no not at all it's just slightly more expensive than let's say hawker place ya what what sort of food do they serve there but it's pleasant a range uh local as well as western you know ya uhm local you can order the dishes or you can order individual ones uhm oh okay that's that's good that's another place uh oh how did this come about actually you went to oh i i just went to see meng choo about something else uhm uhm uhm and then at the end she said oh i must we must have lunch together have lunch together ya and she said then then she thought of you uhm uhm and then she said oh must must ask lay kuan along uhm uhm orh so i said okay ya okay ya uh uh i'll check with lay kuan ya and then get back to her and tell her when you might be free uhm uhm uhm you let me know which thursday because then i can change i have this same class from ten to eleven and then twelve to one uhm there's a one there's a an hour of lapse can change okay okay so what i can do is uh push it down uhm uhm sometimes i continue if if they still feel up to it or if i prepare them for it we continue and then we don't have that hour from twelve to one uhm oh ya that's okay okay i'll i'll so both of us will finish at eleven then this is what on nuh this is on nuh thursday did you say thursday word  thursday well i finish at twelve o'clock ah ah okay so so ya can if i shift my class then i'll finish at twelve o'clock oh would you okay okay then then we can go ya ya thursday alright i'll i'll ask meng choo but would that inconvenience you oh no not at all and also uh probably one week or two later they're getting into tests the tests for interviews oh ya which means that we won't be having formal classes and i'll be testing some other classes so the time-table will be different then i see so thursday is good okay okay then then we'll i will set it at thursday tentatively do you do you teach the second and third years too well i i teach the second years uhm uh eln2 owc oh okay yap so which means that in another one or two they are they are doing interviews too no they're doing uh role-plays no they're not ah okay because i in two or three weeks' time they'll be they'd have finished they would have finished how many hours word  what the the word the eln2 two hours a week two hours but just just one class no i've got let me see uh i've got three classes three classes word  uhm uhm so how do you find your students which group your your second and third years the ah ya the both are bm uhm uhm uh i like the second years very much probably because everything is organised and i i know the syllabus uhm uhm uh pretty well and so uhm and and i think plus the fact or major factor is that they're very uhm uh co-operative uhm uhm and diligent and they're fun at the same time such that when when we have light light things they they all uhm take part and they're very responsive uhm uhm and when their actual work comes uh hard work they they get down to work too they get down to work ya so i enjoy that group very much the third years uh for some reason or other i don't seem to enjoy the class very much uh which course is that both are bm oh don't i know i understand because the the third year syllabus tend to be uhm a little bit more uh more fragmented i think because more fragmented than than the second years uhm uhm uhm than the second years uh ya actually i quite enjoy teaching grammar uhm uhm uhm uhm and that's why i enjoy teaching the first years  word even thouh everybody find it such a drag you know uhm uhm you know ya ya but uhm actually i think it's it's quite a good course in that you you you get them to you know probably for the last time in their lives uhm uhm they will have somebody to they will have something to guide them to guide them and tell them you know such a uh uh word  stringent ya amendment ya because after that it's really free for all kind of thing so ya true and i think they need the basics ya they all do ya even though some of them speak well they they still get down to all the uhm nitty gritty problems uhm uhm in language uhm uhm and i also like the first years for the fact that when they come they're all new to the whole environment yes yes and they stick to each other quite well yes and so and so the class is cohesive ya and i like to teach a cohesive class uhm because they all one for all and all for one for one kind of feeling and and it's fun this way yes right i i i have that feeling also ya and also third third years tend to be more responsive no first years tend to be more responsive responsive ya whereas the second years they're all jaded and cynical somewhat yes yes yes ya and they know the tricks of the trade like how many times to be absent absent and how to irritate you but otherwise ya and i always find first years more uh more appreciative yes uhm ya whereas the second years tend to be a little more they they more indifferent ya towards the teacher they rely a little bit more on you maybe that's why it makes me feel good too because this' their first year and they don't know about things like uh uh rules or regulations uhm and and and what how to go about this and that uhm and it it feels good that they depend on you or on the class as a whole uhm uhm and that's why they do come to class with more ya expectations and ya look uh with more anticipation ya uhm that's why  word  and also second years when they move up to the second year they do change groups they do change the grouping is it yes and then they don't they they have to make friends all over ya ya and then so usually if one of two friends go up with them they just clique with these two uhm uhm yes and then two or three others from another group stay  word yes and then i i don't like it this way when they don't mix well and co-operate yes yes and then when it comes to final year they are they become quite individualistic oh ya ya because all they want to do is to get out of the place get out of the place finish the project and then you know ya ya and also then again more street-wise too more street-wise campus-wise ya then i hear i i i always get to uhm to you know listen to all these complaints about ya what group word  ah yes yes people who can't work with each other yes and uh yes and quite a few times i have to mediate you know oh between that uh between them in their quarrels ya and help uhm ya the second years the the third years mainly the third years because i used to teach the third years bms usually projects ya so every time they have a project you get one or two who are not very co-operative uhm uhm makes life difficult for the others oh ya uhm and and this year we are told to assess them uh or rather one component is peer assessment uhm and i hated it when i have to call up one person and say and like oh you tell me about that group hey like gossiping i feel so i'm ya i feel as though i'm encouraging them to tell uh tell tale about each other tale but i guess but how do they respond do they tell on each other actually it's i have to i have to do they take that opportunity to ya i've always to to to set the whole perspective right you see you know you you mustn't think that is a friend just tell me objectively whether whether you like or dislike the person just tell me whether the person does contribute fairly or not you know i keep having to set this scenario before they tell me things and so what happens do do they actually gossip it's okay they no i think they they straighten up and they realise it's their responsibility uh to to to tell the right thing  uhm uhm uhm so they do tell me if some are not working hard uhm and also i match that with my own observation i see ya when when they discuss and i in fact sometimes i'm more prejudiced i i feel that certain people are not contributing but when this person come and say: oh ya he or she does uhm so i have to change my own uh uh assessment too uhm uhm uhm 
Singapore	 31 march 1992  cecilia after a while you will you will ask question like okay understand  ya and after a while all your vocab is down the drain actually it's quite true you know because uh like when i was teaching uh sometimes when when you have to speak their level sometimes you may have to even speak bro broken english you know ya in order that they understand you know ya ya not for your own sake but for their sake you may have to  so if for i mean if you do that for long alright you fear that maybe your standard of english will deteriorate also definitely most most probably ya so you all better watch out one of these day i'll be speaking in broken english you don't say you know 'a' not me you all don't know even for me uh i work in the library cos i have to conduct course visits right ah for the for students i mean when they come uh and some of them lah they're from very bad schools i mean from the quite lousy schools okay uhm uhm and so when i talk to them and i if i want to make myself understood let's say to the lower primaries at primary two primary four and they're from word  courses uh i've to i've i've to do that too i always quite embarrassing because there's a teacher who's sitting behind and then they say huh even the librarian also speak like that nuh but i may have to do it because like one teacher told me you know wah you speak so good english to them they won't understand you you know it's true it's strange ya that's what they told me but you have no such trouble like mine so uhm not really i don't think i have usually uh i have to speak business english with the bankers ya i think  word english be more professional lah you know i think peck see probably won't have won't have that kind of problem lah because ya i mean if you're if you're talking to bankers in fact the bankers that i i dealt with uh most of them are overseas graduates so they slang a bit when i talk to them can can tell lah this slang i hated people who slang wah i can't stand it and i can't understand that's the worst part ya lor aiyah 'a' then we're talking about the tour how uh i mean what did you find out are you are you going oh word  'a' are you going or not are you keen or not what should i say okay let me let me present you with the itinerary okay and the prices which part of june you said what what tour agency is that okay okay uh sunny sunny serves sunny uh which part of june which part of june uh i mean it's probably second or third first it's either first second or third of june that we'll be going that means we'll be departing uh uhm uhm three days the offer is three days uh huh uhm actually it was only three nine nine but because june is the peak season ya so they add another eighty dollars surcharge so it's about four seven nine four seven nine uh correct or not oh you mean go four seven nine uh during that season more expats yes ya definitely because it's like the our school holiday its peak season you know ya it's what it's it's school holiday high season they call it ya word it'll definitely be more expensive four seven nine the only thing we find it attractive is that additional night is only thirty dollars and it's four-star hotel oh you mean if if you want to extend ah you stay in in the same hotel hotel it's only thirty dollars more it's only thirty dollars more you can change to another hotel of the same class ya 'a' that's not bad what huh ya it's quite interesting in the sense you can stay in two different hotels uhm ya ya and it's only thirty dollars other other tour agencies fifty to sixty dollars and it's four-star lah four-star hotel lah is it uhm i think so around there that's why i don't know up to you 'a' the problem is not uhm okay what's the itinerary like yes yes first i thought you said you have financial prob i do i do i tell you uh after going to australia and coming back uh i'll be dead broke you know i mean i would dearly loved to go with you cecilia but the problem is shall i just aiyah what the heck you know i just go just ya ya cl & go ya ya ya yes yes yes you should and forget about the money or i should be you know i should be thrifty and i should be careful now that i'm going to be very poor i don't know what i'm going to do uhm uhm i think you can you can just put aside five hundred and you can have a very nice five four-day holiday you tell me word ha in cantonese  sufficient or not five hundred put aside five hundred dollars five hundred you see this is four seven nine but you go there you have to buy things what okay plus uh that's provided you don't buy things lor wait wait wait you said it's four seven nine for three days uh ah four seven nine then plus twelve dollars airport tax ya ya but then the food leh do they cover all meals word  they they covered all meals except the fourth uh the third first second nuh third day third day only breakfast so you settle your own dinner and nuh lunch so two days that means covered except third day dinner and lunch then word  ah then the fourth day i suppose they give you the breakfast before you fly off wait wait wait wait oh that means it's actually a four-day tour lah if you want nuh i'm assuming you go for four days so the fourth because three days is like too short you see uh first day and second day there'll be tours guided tours you know that means they'll take you they will take us to places ya and then third day and you go off don't you think it's it's four four days that's the seven four seven nine one four days it's four wah it's more than that you know five zero nine five zero nine ah plus extra thirty dollars that's why five zero nine five zero nine uh so four days it's five zero nine five over hundred dollars already you know it's not even within the five hundred dollars ya cannot then word five five zero lor cos' like assuming aiyah ah ah ah first day you go pangah pangah beach is it uh pan uh pan pangah bay pangah beach uh uh uh ya okay beach ya okay ah pangah ah ah whatever lah i mean then uh all the tours or museum ah cave and so on then on the second got museum meh i don't know whether it's museum or temples uh temples uh something i can't

not a cheap place ya cheapest place is bangkok you know last time uh when it was not so commercialised and then you know not so developed as a tourist spot yet i mean it was quite cheap but i think now because of uh uh uh avalanche of western tourists then you know they word together i think now more expensive but somebody told me it's not cheap uh ya i heard it's because they have to import the goods right from bangkok itself i mean they are selling they are selling imported goods is it so actually bangkok is cheaper lah ya bangkok itself is very cheap i tell you if you ask ee lan about that she will tell you about  word vigorously really cheap in terms of what in terms of like shopping ya lah things are very cheap she bought so much for christmas last year ha she wants to go again ha

in east coast  word  ya lah you know 'a' my sis is desperate to get out of teaching ha really why how long has she been there but she's got six more years to go right ya how long has she been there oh that's not she's from can't she like get someone else to buy her people can buy ya go and from buy her out from you know like cambridge that kind of thing quite easy to bring her out ya ya so she's trying to write to straits times but then that would mean being stuck in straits times for six years right uhm  word  i thought going to private company is like how many was will will word word  by word  but if she really wants to leave she should but she should give herself a year or two to really decide you know can she tahan a year or two that or try another school no but she was never cut out for teaching lah anyway but she doesn't mind teaching you know it's all the that's what all teachers say uh ya ya uhm word always complain only about admin so now what do you complain about

very boring boring boring boring you're teaching first year is it this year second year one class is very good i mean they're very interested in everything but in other classes like they can't be bothered you know ha like aiyah why are we here in the first place you mean that bad uh i thought your your students will be more motivated than the students from rjc not really you know why would they i think about fifty percent are not not not interested just going through the motion do they see beyond 'a' level i mean what do they see beyond 'a' level university which they can't get into ya lah be realistic they may be very good at word  'a' level is such a useless place isn't it ya unless you can make it to the u you know even word  but then what about education for its own sake uh not at 'a' level why not not when they cram everything in two years uhm and you study from seven thirty to five what do you get out of it ya because and then you talk about anything they don't sound they're not interested in anything you know i mean like the only thing i ever enjoyed was gp because i got something out of it  word  maybe now that i'm leaving uh word like less harsh on i know my perception on the students word  become less word  but i like i like my last my students last time you know the two first two batches i had you brought up anything and discussed they're very interested you know what i mean 'cos it's something interesting you mean you got to work extra hard to make them interested now ya but i'm so tired ya i think it's it's got to do with the system  word also you know i don't think the students would have changed that that much no they're they're definitely different ya i mean they're different now in maybe you just word  and put in their marks uhm except uhm because partly you see there there's commerce classes and science classes and arts classes usually in arts classes they are more talkative science classes also the boys they don't care

Singapore	ya so you're saying about the d and d how what's your response according to michelle uhm about eight eight tables uh you know kee min or michelle ha they manage to get so many ya not not too bad oh and then uh they were saying that uhm only the comp centre staff will get prizes the lucky draw word  oh again the rest all won't be getting so they say it's about half so that means they bought about twen twenty plus twenty plus prize uh so about fifty percent chance uh yes whoa not bad not bad nuh uhm but i don't know what's the prize like uhm first prize is a mini compo mini compo ah that usually costs about three hundred plus three hundred plus uh uhm whoa not bad nuh a much much much more than what what we have for the first prize last time ya because this year the subsidy has gone up from two to four dollars oh yeh ya two to four dollars ya very good uh no what twenty four dollars what ya times two this year they double it up oh so this year is forty eight oh uhm then the what leh what is that uh the second prize is what don't know uh second prize not not interesting second there're twen there're twenty over prize is starting from one to twenty ah how about table table games and word  prize like this uhm word  i heard dbc is coming you know dbc coming here no coming for our d and d oh maybe he's the guest-of-honour ah that's why he's the guest-of-honour that's why everybody say must be there at least before seven thirty mr huang something or dr huang uh oh dr huang uhm i think so that's why i was i was trying to ask michelle who was the guest-of-honour who is going to be then aiyah forgot oh i see i heard i heard from bee guan then uh but you are going right uhm ya because i word  bee guan whether the ad and the director whether they're forming a table ah so she say 'oh maybe because the dbc is coming and then some other people are coming also' so that's why the management side is okay lah no problem so maybe the word  in that case word  but ravi is not going ravi is not going uh how come don't know that's what i heard i was thinking whoa the whole group of them will be going uh but it seems not then kee min keep on pestering me pestering you uh ya she said come uh very good fun actually you can go right because very difficult anyway your children are free also what ya but aiyah have to look after them then too too late already word  maybe you bring one instead of two lah then the other one your uhm can look after then after that you still have to rush back or no point then that that night don't bring him lor cannot nuh i find it's very bad it's okay lah it's once in a while aiyah don't know lah sometimes those relative wedding dinner uhm after that i've to rush all the way there oh rush back to fetch them ya uhm so tomorrow let me know not tomorrow monday let me know what prize you got lah aiyoh i don't know whether my i always not been so-called lucky maybe dr teo will be very lucky yes he's bringing his two kids you know is it ya two kids oh his daughter and son i i i think so 'a' but word daughter-in-law should be three no what his son is not in singapore oh he's in overseas then who who is that two he got another son and daughter lor oh is it ya oh he has three uh three three children altogether  word i thought it's two no then mrs tan is likely bringing her daughter daughter i heard mrs wong wanted to bring her three daughters three three children whoa that's good you know how much they are paid three hundred ha so expensive uh three hundred for what per couple uh don't know uh i think three hundred lah uhm doesn't matter how many you bring oh for dr teo lah oh doesn't matter so no wonder they're bringing so many their children nah three hundred for whoa three hundred quite a lot you know previously was how much uh previously looks like two hundred and forty uh but for two is it two word  whoa that means this round is the previous round was more expensive ya lah if you are you count by the number of people that means they're it's actually hundred and twenty ya then this who leh uhm mrs lim they all leh don't know word  oh because at the time when i asked kee min he was not sure ya amys are paying sixty right bee guan also paying sixty  word because they're they count by their  word  so eileen going uh eileen no lah aiyah that means you and then chay hoon susan ya lor eight of us then just now i told bee guan that uh eileen is not going so she asked word to have this chee wha lor to join us  word asked her husband you know  word she it seems that she's not coming with us do you see yen jing nowadays once in a while very slim ya lor slimmed down already uhm so fast uh actually that time she called up chin hwa during her maternity leave she told me say whoa the baby uh make her lost five kg i think after delivery uh because they say cannot switch on air-con so have to sleep without air-con i think it's so warm that period oh she said she actually literally lost five kg you mean at home cannot sleep with air-con one meh they say if the baby word  too young is it ya not good so who is looking after the baby now that time i asked her it's the husband oh dear her husband cannot look on forever right don't know ya her husband needs to work word  maybe they employ a part-time maid don't know okay must her to bring the daughter a i saw i thought chai hoon wanted to bring his son today right something like that jerry jerry chong jeremy jeremy is it but he was saying too young too young uh he said oh are are you bringing your son to the party then he said no too young too young uh uhm so his wife are going i don't think so the wife have to look after the kid oh did you go to the staff lounge no what do they have they have those indians' hat ya i i know they are very busy with the d and d now about six i think there're six six or eight nuh six hats maybe for the welfare com welfare committee or what oh uhm i don't know whether they they i don't think they have any performance right don't know not not too sure uhm uhm i wonder who will get first prize ya lor last the last time sandra got it sandra uh uhm ha no no no word  what word was what also a mini compo no lah that time was very cheap ya i think uhm it's a is it mini compo it's not a mini compo mini compo is usually those with cd player right ya those those small word  not carry compo i think cos i think it's a bit word carry compo oh those kind word  but that one i think it it's not doesn't cost as much as three hundred plus maybe the most is hundred plus word  whoa this year the first prize very good ya but it seems that they can get cheaper electrical goods right ya from jeremy's friend oh oh that one is his friend nuh ah a lot of gifts idea so next time if you want to give get any gift ask him  word  then ah his friend shop is at i think macpherson uh oh uhm but then if you if you go without his recommendation you won't get the discount also no but but maybe ask him to call up his friend say who and who you see oh or mention his name then the friend always gives discounts then he said do all the losing business not really what maybe the only thing profit that he earn a bit less ah uhm i see don't know haven't been there you know yesterday night i went to this ntuc club that the karaoke lounge aiyoh karaoke lounge full house aiyah yesterday night ha so cannot go in uh cannot oh full house they will cut people off uh uhm they will display that tag that say full house yesterday is friday uhm oh ya friday usually word  ya but i i saw this uhm mini suite nuh uh oh uh quite quite quite cosy if if you want you can actually book they have bigger suite where they have your own private room uh where where they call its private room so they have a few then the glass is transparent you can actually see the number of people inside the room oh but the suite is just sofa lah ah for singing one nuh ya plus i think tv sets and so on uh do you do they serve drinks too ya how much is it don't know because last night we can't gain entry so we said forget it oh so you go all the way there and then you all didn't no we went there aiyah beginning uh we went there so fed up this security guard why my husband went in first because he got the membership so he walked ahead of me so i came in this security guard approached me say do i have card i say 'no' i said he's bringing me then he mumbled mumbled mumbled so my husband asked me 'what is he mumbling about what is wrong ' then we pay up uh that night was five dollars i think for weekends friday to sunday for what is five dollars for guests those without a membership card for the karaoke is it no no no just to enter for word  ya then you can go anywhere that you want oh so we went word  then after that we went to the other side of the lounge to have our dinner the one where they have dancing floor oh then people go down and dance one nuh after that we went to play jackpot i see a quite fun you know so far i haven't played how's the dinner there yesterday night was the curry fish i think curry fish plus rice or another one is the mee soto uhm uhm then the other side the striker lounge uh the lounge where they have the karaoke and so on ah they have i think barbecue chicken wing uh that one is nice formerly was very nice now not too sure oh how come your your husband is a member ya he is leh it's it's his company oh his company ah only member can go in right ya after after five i think if you want to go in earlier then usually they ask you what what what do you want then on top they have this

husband worse uh forty uh whoa but he gained nine between but he didn't want to give up just keep on playing 'a' one day we can go karaoke leh ah you want  word a few of us ya if you you get more people lah let's say then you can book the room ya then you can book one room in fact cc they have i called up the the other cc uh the word  delta delta delta it's at the near to tanglin road near to alexandra road that side oh alexandra oh oh oh okay that one the modern one quite separated lah ah ah they they got what they have it every week weekdays night how much uh fifty dollars for one room any hour lah the whole place lah have uh i think one hour don't know seven thirty to ten or something no no no it's a one whole range one whoa then it's very good uh ya because what they did is that i think weekday night you can book the room then weekends you cannot weekends they will open to public it's like for everybody like that is it ya ya so you can seems that the the room is quite big it's about it seem can house about twenty person like that uhm okay so anyway if fifty if we can take get about ten person each person five dollars already ya it's worth that's excluding drinks uh ya lah no drinks one nuh you can just bring home home packet drinks hor ya yesterday my husband was so disappointed he keep on asking the waitress and say 'any seats for two or not ' he likes to sing is it ya usually he sing what chinese or english english one english 'a' can't stand people singing chinese chinese 
Singapore	so uhm now i've three draughtsmen right i have siew kiau emily uh siew kiau emily diana ah diana and then thomas for the editing so what i ask them to do is simon had already given me the list of  word  uh what what they have submitted you know to the authorities and what they have produced so far lah so next week we can arrange word to discuss about that ya 'think the problem now is really to see how far they have managed to go with the different drawings that they have to do uhm i now uh diana is doing all the word submission drawings she's already finishing up you know uh amending the drawings to fit  word requirements uh so she's doing it manual not on computer and uh diana is now doing for me all the drawings for the the contractor the diaphragm more openings so she's clearing up that lot and then emily is doing elevation drawings with the pre-cast panels four by four work out all the dimensions how far uhm from the coluhmn grid and so on and also i uh the sewage now the sewage reply has come back she has to do updating uhm in the computer so how do you think tom can help to sort of vet the drawings or uh sort of help you in the detailing of some of these things because i think at the moment he does seem to feel a bit difficult uh problems in in co-ordinating some of these drawings is it he didn't fill a form because i i i think the problem also partly because of this computer drawing thing you know ah because we had we can't get a feel of what are the the drawings in the computer what i've asked him to do so far is like for instance the sewage unit uh once the reply came back uhm uh i i made some comments on the reply by by sewage right then i ask uh him to look through and discuss with emily so he looked through emily's set of drawings and discussed how the requirements uh can be met nuh so uh he also went down with emily to see the offices in environment uhm to discuss about their requirement whether we can do it or not or is it cost costing a problem and so on ya so that is the technical part i think he can help me do you know ya all these nitty gritty detail things so uhm it's the same for like the contractor drawings uh uhm because he's got more technical knowledge for the actual construction uhm so if that's true he ask diana to help draw up all these things uh so has he managed to get onto that yet ya he's doing that now but what what i find problem is he's he has not enough time also you know ya so when whenever i ask him he may not do it promptly oh he said do it later ya so like the diaphragm mode we are a bit behind time giving information uhm ya ya i think that's why we are sort of discussing to see what of any of the other work he can uh sort of delegate to other people so that he can have more time for your project when you say continue working drawing you mean uhm they consult him on the detailing or he just checks the drawing i think that he has to i think it would be better if he could really co-ordinate all the drawings so that uh because certain problems which occur on other projects he can sort of make sure that it doesn't recur in this one things like that and the amount of detailing you know because i think for us uhm you i think you'll you need to do a lot more design work right uhm so a lot of these details in a way is probably like wasting your time if you have to go and give all the details to the draughtsmen so this type of things if he can help to uhm give instructions to to them uhm uhm like even like uh now i get the set of drawings from structure word from contractor drawing word  there's slight difference there's a lot of checking to be done uhm yes yes uh to check against our architectural drawings for discrepancies uhm so uhm yes some of those if he can whether he will be the one actually doing it or he should have he will as eh de designate and allocate duties to the rest i think those type of details if the draughtsman who is doing the actual drawing of say the rises uhm they probably uh know the details of the rises sort of better so maybe the the to themselves can can check some of those type of details but those things which are like okay staircase details and those floor plans sections and all that uhm i think tom can help to just check that what they've drawn uhm is sort of practical or you know any uhm detailing things that they've to look out for uhm and uhm i don't know perhaps we should also look into what we can use standard drawings uhm see what other things whether there are any standard drawings that you can sort of incorporate uhm rather than having to actually now they're not really getting into details yet you know it's it's still overall plan and getting levels correct uhm floor like staircase trap riser and landing levels floor  word levels uhm and then the riser opening shifting the beams and all these things okay uhm ya but i think we have to already start on the details right because or else uhm august is very close i know like i i ya try to list like ya there's one thousand and one drawings to do you know that's right how to finish you know ya that's right ya i don't know hopefully with the new drauhtsmen coming in for cmb i don't know whether we can use any uh to produce whether there they can help us or not can we use their resources i think if if they are not uh i don't know whether they need  word straightaway now or not uhm whether we can help whether they can help to do something for us first uhm because our timing is a bit ahead of theirs right uhm so it'll be something we have to discuss with the lam side uh uhm you want to talk anything more interesting ya the d and d uh janet is going to be my stage manager so uhm have you got the tape uh i can't i can't recall having it you know i've asked you to check with nina huh because uh she was handling the thing because jin jin said uh she returned the tape to you jin jin was the one who did the taping of the friday background and said uh news opening piece uh i've to go through so last night i tried i taped the news and then i did a narration of the opening scene uh then after that i was supposed to tape friday background you know then my sister her stupid watch was slow by five minutes so i i was talking so you were with her and a friend so by the time i went and word the tv the uh hey uh opening scene music was gone so i tape the ending of friday background the music i'm not sure if it's the same as the opening music ha i can't recall i'll go through whatever tape i can find uh but i can't recall if i had it what i would have done with it you see uhm but uh i think in fact they had it on different tapes is it because i taped the voice myself oh that was oh you did the newsreading i did the newsreading uhm but i think i did i tape onto that i can't remember maybe i did uh i can't remember i'll i'll you see if you can find lah ya if not i'll just use whatever i've taped you know uhm it's just that the friday background only comes like i think every two weeks right one word  is it two weeks i think it's every two week you know i thought there's only one then there's contact-y then there's feed oh yes every two weeks there's feedback fortnightly oh feedback and then friday background feedback friday it'll be too late next week it's it's saturday is d and d ya ya ya ya so he's she's doing stage management now he's going to collect all the props for me lah uhm the only problem we have is like word i forgot to call mandarin uh to ask them whether they have a whiteboard and a flip chart we want to mount the you know the carpark sign on the uhm uhm uhm flip chart you know ya and then use their whiteboard to pin up the world map i thought flip chart flip chart we can still bring but whiteboard will be rather big quite difficult i think they should have uh because we don't have a flip chart they what they use last time was a a smaller whiteboard y' know which is still quite high uhm on castors i don't think we can put that into her car i think mandarin should have lah because they organise seminars  word   word seminars ya i think they should have flip chart so they should have so these are the only two things uh that mandarin has to provide lah the rest we can bring right uhm prop uh costuhmes and uh what else huh the guns and all that have they given you the stage layout no i think i shall ask from them ya because in case they have the big uhm sound mixers and all that the deejays equipment ya may be blocking don't know if they show that on the layout then they will have to check with the word huh thursday we have rehearsal they slotted us on thursday on stage is it ya at mandarin okay because the last time when we had the other show remember we had to discuss with victor khoo where he was going to put all his deejay desk and all that ya see this woman that woman uh can't stand her she just wrote a letter to mandarin you know who is this woman and then tsk okay kr ya lah ya now this woman who is the secretary lah of the committee uh so she just wrote a letter and cc to menon the chairman right and then give it word  then menon gave it to me she just word  in the letter your rehearsal time is what time to what time and then another organization what time to what time and tell the banquet manager to prepare uh we need how many standing mikes and all that very simple lah her requirements is standing mikes stage of what size and so on so i've called her up i said uh are you sure they will be able to give us the exact layout on thursday d and d is on saturday they might have other functions on friday right uhm so the last time our last year d and d they couldn't give us the exact ya arrangements ya so there's no point going down if there is no they can't give provide you the exact arrangement so i called her on the phone she said oh i assuhme he has to do it i already wrote to him you know  uh i already told him what's our requirement and he should prepare that on thursday she also cc to the deejay of that night is it victor khoo uh no it's leslie pillay leslie pillay one of those guys on either radio or tv lah uhm uhm so uh i said then can i call uh the sales banquet manager myself she said yeh you go and call yourself so i had to call the banquet manager and ask him are you going to provide all those things that she lists down in her letter i mean she can't even be bothered to contact him and find out if everything will be okay uhm uhm uhm uhm it's all on the letter only uhm in fact last time we even went down to to discuss with the deejay and everything what the exact location ya ya so she cc to the deejay i hope the deejay turns up on thursday i doubt it you know i mean she's not even ya bothered to find out if those people will turn up because uhm what else because if they have say a big prize table on stage ya the deejay's thing on stage the rostruhm and all that then then i ask her you know do we have a day-room that we can store our props uhm then she say no just at the the usual lah say where do you keep your lucky draw prizes uhm she said oh we just keep it backstage ya so i thought normally the hotel will give a room ya so i ask the banquet sales manager by on the phone uh i ask him he said ya we're giving them the organizer a day-room ya ya i would think so what the last time we had a day-room also right ya ya word  i think she just don't want us to use it ya must be 
Singapore	wife is only going to word  oh ya ya that's what you were saying and i just i called the mother today she told me that she has a house uh uh but two of them are staying one uhm me and

because actually word  they wanted another day to go to belgiuhm then i thought don't want nah i want to go to this place why oh so you're not you know my in my first itinerary the first time i also thought that from paris to amsterdam we can stop by at belgiuhm so that  word brugg b-r-u-g-g  word  so in the end i also didn't have time word i was not feeling well so i want to go amsterdam to sleep so one day two days uh oh so you're going is it uhm hey hope it's fun then actually maybe indiana you you need to visit only one uh you know you're going both you're you're only going one right i'm going to both belvedere and word  on different days though belvedere is nice because of the painting ha this is nice because of the gardens ya lah that's why we have to split it and see it twice what i mean to see through the whole thing uhm 'a' morning oh ya you walk across the garden go up right to the top on the opposite side then you can you have word and you can sit around there to have your lunch  word  this one is a conducted tour you know  word  when you go in ya you cannot go in on your own oh okay oh ya ya you have to buy tickets and they'll bring you in did you go in ya i went in to see all those and usually you have to queue up ah so you try to go in as early as possible okay you're going to join a conducted tour uh this one no we're just doing it on our own why when you get a old town uh will we get lost this half the time you spend you know reading the map then in the end say forget it then just walk you like that building we go in and see is it labelled i mean with the places they're supposed to have is it indiana or salzburg which one is the one that i have the a to z indiana ya so each one of them is supposed to have a number so you see a number you make your a to z lah you want don't buy i have one can keep ya 'a' uh person c you have the indiana a to z right okay we lee i think it'll be fun though did you see your friend's pictures she hasn't shown you any pictures where milan no he went into one month ago you know oh but but he told his uhm uh that the place is actually safe i mean considering what he has heard from here you know says very safe ha i don't know some pictures i don't know i've seen some pictures and it looks very modern so i don't know whether i should stay here you see got a long trip to travel uh uh can you imagine from here you know on thurs on ya on friday onwards i'll be on that express the nina express supposed to be very very scenic and it's covered by euro-rail so i travel all the way to ita italy and from here i've to wait i then travel to milano and i'll depart again whoa near near midnight you know to word  one whole day just overnight lah ya it's a whole day you arrive there what time twelve hours four it's a twelve-hours journey goodness but then i have to wait then you hang around word which has nothing unless unless i stay overnight here i don't know what there should be some other trains right that come in later but i don't know whether i can get the tickets or not you've got the eu i've got the timetable here i don't think they will tell you internals in-between internal rail it does uhm milano word  yes all these  word  yours is this one right the last the last service ya i could take this one uhm but still oh in the morning uh uh that means you only have two hours to catch 'a' twenty one thirteen ya so you have about two hours to one hour to catch ya but i don't trust the italian trains so a little earlier lah say word reach there about five o'clock so i still have to stay overnight at milan right uh 
Singapore	 word i want you to tell me how much to change okay but have you decided roughly what word  amount i don't know how much you want what is the estimate have you all decided or not have not decided because eight hundred you all were saying for the food and the no for accommodation and entrance fees right ya but then you got the breakdown or not maybe you can ask uh beng what is the best best op do you know how much currency we need to bring how much are you estimating for food let's say per meal i don't know just bringing two thousand dollars oh two thousand uh ya then from there word  but how much are you going to change for each country five hundred when i go there then i know what oh you're just bringing all cheques is it ya word owes me two hundred and forty six dollars but it's not in currency ya ha so beng how how much do you think we should estimate per meals forty twenty forty for accommodation twenty per day but our accommodation is all fostered in right now in your latest ya but i don't see i don't think you should count it that way what i gave you was an estimate i mean are you going to take take all the money out and then separate out this is uh what moving money and that is word that means right so your two thousand includes what you have costed in your itinerary plus food and souvenirs ya ya the whole thing so that is about what we have calculated  two thousand two thousand so which means it's correct you see it's about five hundred to word  five hundred per country is it ya so if you go by her estimate in the write-up then that one each country is about two hundred fifty so we left about two hundred fifty for our own food and souvenirs then if want to bring some more cheques hor we only have four countries so word  two thousand uh ya it's enough so that's why we were intending to ask him to  word can you pass me your cash cheque cheque cheques and your name in my name uh oh okay lor okay okay in my name in my name then i write a cash cheque for them oh to the because uh the money people prefers cash cheques oh i see are you going to bring traveller's cheques ya traveller's cheques but are you going to bring cash as well ya as well mag leh you i'm intending to bring all cash you know but make it a bit of traveller's cheques all cash huh you know what i'm afraid of losing it you know you don't know whether i'll lose it or not two hundred and fifty just in case anyway we are we are sharing you know so each one of us will be only be carrying two thousand dollars two thousand for two currencies what you mean you are sharing she's going to hold two countries' currency i'm going to hold two currencies oh then if you need is that better huh i think just handling less currency that is all lah but oh the amount of the amount spent is the same so you're just going to contribute into the pool lah or something like that actually we're not even contributing i'll just buy for ya lah ya lah you know how much for the currency come back then word whatever that's the receipt for vicky for the europass so the europass is four 0 nine right ya word another four one ya i'm going to write the cheque so how so can write me a cheque will it be you have already okay i have the cheque here no but the amount is not specified  word calculator anybody got calculator i think i have i have a calculator do you know the exchange rates no i don't know the exchange rates exactly speaking roughly then based on this one right student ya roughly but usually word sing dollar two thousand and then i'll change it for you five hundred per currency ya or what but that means you will have very loose change right you may come up to the last cent and all that oh uh i thought maybe we could do it the other way like five hundred guilders or five thousand guilders then how much sing dollars per guilder word  but that means four hundred and something sing dollars  word  ah oh isn't it easier but the exchange you might not know the exchange rates or you can roughly word  just a rough rough estimate or is it easier to say i want uh five hundred worth of five hundred sing dollars worth of guilders ya then they just give you the amount right so you have come up with a few cents all the loose word is it easier this way or you're going to change but loose change is alright what they might not have loose change in fact then they might want word sing dollars from you then they might ask you to buy less sing dollar uh ya lor doesn't matter lor ya lah but roughly you would say okay about five hundred for this currency but maximum two thousand right ya because if we if we calculate now we can roughly gauge like the closest to five hundred like okay amsterdam is what ah this is already three zero one this is one currency right ya okay this is about two seventy you know three about two seven something uh 'a' but this per person right per person okay so if two persons you need three 'a' how does it work there the numbers are here oh okay three zero zero where is zero here here where's on and off three zero zero times aiyuh so confusing looking at the alphabets wrong already wrong already three zero hey i'm going to bring this along you know ya i think this is useful three zero one are you sure you can use point five point aiyah multiply okay about six zero word  for food right point two why multiply by two oh i see i see two person two person will be six hundred and three okay time three uhm then times point nine oh no for food only ya this is only for food aiyah don't need don't need i'll just do it in singapore's singapore currency uh ya then ya okay two seven two seven one two seven one point three nine three nine one word is two five word : t then my ya terrible it's too close it's too close aiyah come uh come uh two seven one point three five times two times two this and then so bring up to a thousand dollars uh the closest times times two again why times two again okay can you uhm oh minus one thousand this okay this amount would be just why don't you just calculate one thousand then you times word  you might not have enough no this one is just for accommodation and entrance fees right oh okay okay okay we need for meals and for so how ya ya ya so this is times two then you can times two again right only it's going to be another double of the amount of of accommodation so got paper or not write down the  four that's a lot ha whatever name we word  can write behind right three how much of the 'a' this one is very rough you know about this is about sing ya one zero eight five point four sing dollars right then how do you convert to guilders eight five point divide by multiply by divide by 0 nine about there lor thousand two 0 one two zero six guilders so either you can get one two 0 0 guilders or just a round up figure or a thousand guilders but i can't tell you how much they have you know huh only they will know how much they have right small change no need that means you give me a round figure one thousand guilders but she cannot get all big notes right i don't know i don't know what they have you must try and get oh it doesn't matter ya lor it it could be ya lah in word  ten smaller word  okay but it's not not too much small ones uh okay okay actually small ones also okay actually small ones are word okay what no but too much of it uh you can imagine how much you're going to carry inside can we get one thousand two hundred guilders two tens how much in sing dollars one thousand two hundred one two zero zero divide uh word point point nine dutch word right thousand eight one zero eight zero sing dollars huh one zero eight no this one is small you know we want to round up to this uh so it's one zero eight zero zero just an estimate you know okay and but did you work out like the number of days you know twenty nine ya this is four days three nights uh one zero four one zero six point five four how come uh you're not executives uh still union members uh ya lor not like you lor one four plus three four three four four plus ninety one point seven per thousand sharks! what did you do hey help oh must get it right one point point austria austria how many days uh do you know how many days ya i told you it's not how many days will we will we be in austria how many days are we in austria miss p 'a' how come cannot equal one miss p how many days are we in austria aiyah how to use your calculator how many days are we in austria count lah itinerary is there what okay two four one point six four how about sing dol rough estimate sing dollars currency see i told you it's about two hundred something in each country per estimate ya so so if i times two four one two person nah that's for one person okay four eight three point two eight this is in sing dollar ah ya you want to write down huh ya very rough one you know okay you see your paper very untidy no uh i write the rough one then later you write the proper one four eight this is only on this uh for two person okay then uhm plus this one is just times two uh times two again see how many days you know one two three four five six six days hor but then the thing is that because austria we'll be there for six days some place are cheaper some place are more expensive actually austria is expensive you know austria so maybe we should put more there but seems like it's less than this is it ya the amount is less than this actually because of all the entrances uh two four something it's all the tours that we are joining oh then don't forget mag added one more the that pleasure palace or what oh ya ya ya the funny one ya don't know what sort of where water will shoot at you from did you know there's one one watery watery fun of those tapes which are called pleasure palace is it ya what yes eeeee palace ah ya ya no halbrune pleasure castle for watery fun for wet fun

thinking of how you you use use musical variety to drive the this uh arr but only there's there's two dealer bring in word 
Singapore	oh no i don't know what to say now we've exhausted everything i'm nervous ya you've had to start since it's after all all your doing has it started yet it's started already oh no well say something we had so much to say ya we had so much to say i think uhm i wonder how sensitive this microphone is are we speaking too softly do you think i don't know well speak up then okay so have you have you figured out how to uhm teach me how to buy pork bones oh no i forgot all about that oh you forgot the recipe uhm pork bones from cold storage oh really just buy the pork bones i think so and then what do you do just dump it in hot just dump it in water and let it boil that's what i would do and then uhm i mean how do you know it's ready oh uhm i think it get it becomes frothy oh then you have to some kind of scummy kind of frost rises to the surface ya and you'll you'll have to scoop off the scum and throw it out throw it out and you can put in other ingredients like so as long as it's frothing just scoop off all the froth yeah and then what happens and then it just keeps boiling and boiling ya i i'm not sure maybe i've got to boil it for about two hours and then uhm and then after you've skinned it all off what you have is pure stock is it i think so ya ack oh oh you'll probably add some spices your salt and all that ya oh okay did you learn to cook before you were married oh no i no oh don't think i even knew how to cook an egg oh so when did you learn uhm after i got married no my husband is both of you started to starve fated to cook oh no he's a good cook oh your husband is a good cook ya he's quite encouraging so he started off uh started off started me off on some recipes and then actually it's quite fun you know i mean i do enjoy cooking ya ya i i love cooking it's just aiyoh now ya when you get back and you're very tired uhm it becomes a chore but actually cooking is so fun ya we used to cook in uhm almost everyday i think maybe except for about two three nights a week oh ya before the kid came oh but now your mother-in-law cooks for you no we just eat at her place once a week oh that's right you told me you would cook in bulk right ya oh uhm uhm how about baby's food what do you do oh that's something brand new for us you actually cook you know or or just buy bottle actually i'm still trying to figure out what's best for her but last weekend we went out shopping and we got a crockpot oh then we got a food processor oh so we're going to try new stuff oh no so that's my my my new interest cooking baby's food oh ya i feel like getting a crockpot too ya i think word  because i've heard it's ever so easy uhm you can get a really nutritious meal ya uhm and have it cooking while you're at the office ya so that's right unless you get an electrical fire in the meantime that's not likely so how uhm is this the first time you've started using a crockpot uhm it will be my first time i haven't used it yet using the crockpot ya uhm feel like getting one but my kitchen is so small oh where're you living we're living at pandan valley ya we just moved in a few days before christmas last year uhm uhm ya we like it very much but uhm uhm no actually there are no buts we actually do like it very much i was just is that your own place ya we just bought it uhm last year ya uhm uhm oh now i know what i was trying to say this thing threw me up and made me really nervous i mean we like it very much but uhm sometimes we feel like we don't get to enjoy it enough because uhm okay we're working the whole day that's fine ya you know everybody works the whole day ya but then when we get back very often we have work to do still so we're sort of uhm hunched over the macintosh you know trying to type things out ya or you know so sometimes like the last weekend this weekend that just came and went there was a chance for us to you know sit there and just enjoy being in our own home ya you know like cooking ya like cooking and just looking out the yard looking out the window and the you know the lawn outside uhm so we really enjoyed that a lot ya ya but i guess it's not that bad lah to at least like your home a lot ya even if you feel like you know uhm you wish you had more chance to just sit there and enjoy it rather than tearing around all the time trying to get things done ya anyway i must tell you about the first time i cooked for my husband before we were married uhm uhm okay he was my boy-friend then ya uh huh and what happened was it was so funny i wanted to impress him and at that time i was in the states you see uhm so oh okay i bought cooking i bought this book entitled uhm chinese cooking a to z or step-by-step or something you know really simple it was so funny i followed it practically step by step but took so long to read each step and the similar instructions you know uhm before i went on to the next one that things just went crazy like the first step was to heat up oil in the wok ya and let the oil heat up before you throw in the garlic you see but i took so long reading the next few steps that the oil kept heating until when i threw in the garlic the garlic simply went black oh ya everything was terrible and i didn't know that you had to separate broccoli into flowerets you know uhm you have to slice off the stem did you put the whole thing in i just i mean broke off great big chunks you know and i didn't know you had to yeah chop off the stalk word and there was this great big green things you know uhm trying to cook and i didn't know that it mattered which part of beef you bought you see  word  uhm uhm which cut of beef for es especially for stir-frying ya you should try to buy steak uh huh you shouldn't just buy cube beef or you know stewing beef ya ya i'm not very good at that either uhm i've bought stewing beef which just because really tough the whole time to stir-fry it uhm so that was really a meal to remember you know the broccoli was great big chunks the garlic was all black so was he impressed and the beef what he kept saying not bad not bad but i noticed he didn't eat very much except for the rice uhm ya so but i've come a long way i think ya what do you cook now uhm my husband's favourite is mango beef oh interesting oh it's really delicious uhm uhm it's supposed to be a cantonese dish you know but i haven't uhm met any other cantonese who who's heard of i bet it's a cantonese dish in those easter uh no western eastern type of cookbooks right oh western eastern well it was written by a chinese lady who's been at the west in the states for a long time ya well she claims it's a cantonese dish anyway it tastes really nice oh uhm it's just like stir-frying beef like you would uhm stir-fry oyster sauce beef or anything ya but uhm the seasoning is slightly different uhm uhm you don't use so much oyster sauce you use a bit more uhm all sorts of things yep wine and all that dark dark soya sauce ya a bit of this a bit of that ya some spices uhm and you actually cook the mango too uhm and it comes out really delicious oh must get the recipe from you oh ya ya i'll photocopy it you you're not cantonese are you are you cantonese no i'm hokkien oh you're hokkien ya but i don't know any hokkien dishes i mean real ones oh okay ya well my cookbook gives all the uh a dialect breakdown i mean alleged you know provincial specialties you see ya uhm ya so now my next great ambition is to steam a fish all by myself oh whoa i can tell you're impressed oh ya i normally do uhm well it's a i i normally do the more western type of dishes uhm uhm not because you know it's western but because it's easy it's very easy so what i oh casseroles and that's right oh word  i'll just dump everything into the pot and then put it in the oven and it's ready it's very convenient ya ya so uhm what sorts of casseroles do you do oh all types uhm beef vegetables chicken stew beef ya beef casserole like beef stew wait a minute if you do beef stew it has to be done on the stove top right uhm it can be done word  oh i don't have any means is this some muh original creation i don't know do you do cheese casseroles when word  oh ya we've tried that uh but not on word  pasta oh with pasta ya uhm ya  word chicken noodle casserole ya ya that sort of stuff uhm but oh then the beef then then it'll be minced beef oh you mean actual minced beef minced beef and then pasta and cheese not not slices of of beef or anything of beef not usually chopped up when i do the uhm beef stew it's normally cubed i mean like stewing beef right oh stewing beef right uhm ya i can't remember sometimes i guess i use the stove top but sometimes the oven uhm 'a' it's sort of cooked already and then i'll put it in the oven ya oh actually since you have a crockpot now you probably will might be useful huh 'a' because my mother has a crockpot ya and the first time she did all kinds of stews using different kinds of meats and they always came up wonderful oh okay ya so you'd probably find your beef stew really delicious you know if you try doing it ya i haven't thought of using the crockpot for stews you know oh oh i mean it's the silly i mean it's the one you know thing typical dish for the crockpot right ya right now i'm just thinking okay i can use the crockpot for my baby food oh no so you word my mind is rather expensive baby oh she is she is isn't she ya the last weekend we spent about two hundred dollars just on her no two hundred and fifty on on her things what things we bought her a baby chair oh we bought her the crockpot the food processor the food processor we bought her a busy board you know what's a busy board oh oh the sort with the telephone thing and and all sorts of activity type of you know whatever you call them ya right ya uhm uhm squeak thing and word thing  it's a squeak thing word and this thing and that thing ya uh supposed to stimulate the mind aid in baby development and what else did we get for her gosh ya food food ya milupa baby food what vegetable hotpot and garden vegetable oh my canderole oh my here we are back at food again  word  well wait until you have your third or fourth oh no i don't intend to have a third or fourth ya uhm when are you going to have nuhmber one nuhmber one word oh me ya uhm let me first deliver my bouncing baby phd and then seriously actually we're just waiting for my phd to be over when do you expect it to finish well i'm going to do my best to try and get it done by january uhm uh which isn't as much as it sounds because i still have other things to do ya i'm going to be preparing my courses my course not my courses ya uhm my course and then because i'm somewhat new at teaching it's uhm i tend to have to over-prepare just to make sure that i feel sufficiently confident uhm when i'm facing the class ya so i guess uhm it's a combination of all these factors that's making me so terribly busy right now ya can imagine yes so the last thing i i can afford to do is to have a baby as well oh no has your husband finished his thesis yet oh ya he got his phd last year uhm so yours is like on hold at the moment uhm mine is uhm no it's not on hold it's oh you've already got it frantically under uh oh no i haven't gotten it yet but i'm frantically slogging away at it it's the last stages of the thesis word  i don't know what to call it uhm it's it's a question of revising the first draft uhm uhm but revising is a really heavy deal ya it's a really really heavy draining consuhming activity  word  yep uhm ya because i mean it's so i mean your thesis has to be so finely tuned ya and then and then uhm in an extended work when you change anything because the arguhments and the line of reasoning is so intensely involved right ya uhm you have to you know go through the whole thing and start making changes you know and all the implications as well 
Singapore	okay okay i think we'll start unconsciously okay what i'm trying to say is that do you know that ha do you know i've got this scba thing you know this this is to inform ya saying about this uhm scba on june you're applying for it uh you're applying for it i've already got it and guess what's the date june the sixteen my birthday what luck! just nice lor they can celebrate your birthday there what please lah i mean isn't it i can't even celebrate my birthday properly you know in this case  interruption from a lady colleague  no i didn't i didn't i didn't switch it on no i didn't switch it off i've not been touching it for a long time okay ya and do you know there's a eight it's they give you eight minutes to present my slides i thought yours is a poster it's not slide presentation you still must do isn't it right ya ya ya i think so that means yours will be a a talk lah oh that's why i say i'm so anxious eight minutes you know right i thought it's a i thought it's submitting a poster you know 'a' never mind what that time i when i do my final year uh ya ya ya ya presentation it's also my birthday you know and then just give lah you know what to do uhm lt 25 you know i see big lt you know whoa this one is this' a very big one uh about six hundred people you know no no no no that's at lt 27 this is about three hundred four hundred you know where's lt 27 uhm uhm uhm lt 25 is a medium word so that's a great experience for you huh great experience for you what great experience i don't want it before you start you can announce what ladies and gentlemen today is my birthday today is my birthday can you please observe five minutes' silence i'm frightened please don't ask me too tough questions ya but it's quite bad you know don't you think so see how surprised i thought it's just a poster so you don't have to make poster lah for your case but i have to make slides uh ya look that means slide presentation sor i've to make slides but 'a' you got some experience or not you got some experience or not making slides 'a' that time you have already what those slides that you have ya but they're totally different this time you have to make slides for for gels stuff like that with the results and so on i think there's a lot of work involved uh ya but can i make it less than eight minutes uh but even now i say down here at eight minutes i think seven six minutes should be quite alright lah five minutes five minutes maybe too short you know five minutes is only about sixty percent of the time only if seven eight minutes i think should be alright uh no i think you definitely got more things to talk about isn't it i don't want to talk too much because i've told you i've got  word in august you got slides and so on you've got another one in august i've got another one in august so i don't want i don't want to talk too much because  word  i thought that time you submitted a poster session so you just put posters and then just stand around you know the thing is i think they are the ones who decide oh they decide so that is most ya lah good lah maybe they find that it's very interesting isn't please lah i am not it's probably very new so they are quite eager to find out more i think it's because of alan potter what do you think is he in the committee what do you think uh it's im it's organized by imcb ya provided he's sitting in the committee uh no he's not i don't think so then i don't think so i ask i'll ask this who uh keng chong uh first can we change ask him to change to posters seriously change it to poster uh ya what about that ya maybe you can try you can try is it you can try uh i all along i assume it's a poster you know ya i thought it's a poster too that's what you said isn't it it's outside that lt down there the canteen there ya ya ya ya and then just put your poster there and then just stand around lah ya ya ya ya ya word  and then ah ah ya i'll ask keng chong about it uh how's that uhm oh another thing how about keng chong did he receive this already he receive i don't know i'm going to ask him then oh maybe his is a a poster or so i can swop with him you mean you can swop with him uh or if his is a talk then too bad lah you know i think it maybe quite difficult you know because they already allocated the time everything for you already so it's quite difficult for you to withdraw like that why aiyah stupid me lah then but the good thing is a talk you just go there and then finish up the whole thing eight minutes you see because poster i think you have to stand there for the whole day and so on right you never know whether come on a talk i would have known word  i word  i'll stutter all the way well imagine kenneth mark down there can already what please he won't be back that's why i hope he'll back before then no give you moral support uh but then i don't think so really what do you think whoa dr helen chai alright man what do you really think please i didn't see this uh uhm you just like to slime me right who is this person uh joseph lee uh the one who who send this is actually this guy i think it's a china man you know singapore word  oh uh uh 'a' don't be surprised you know one of my uhm relative brother-in-law actually uh huh somebody wrote from him uh ya ya  word from uh london to singapore you know uh huh it actually en route to india before i come back to singapore really really no kid they actually got a chop 'india' down there you know no i don't believe you zhen de zhen de in mandarin) it's quite long ago lah how come last time he went there to study for his masters you see uh huh then he got some friends there then when they wrote back singapore actually went to india you know before he get he got to receive the letter but i can see uh from this person this person is a never mind i'll ask keng chong about it anyway oh good lah interesting what good experience 'a' ask you something uh but the thing is then you have to do duplicate uhm more work uh because if this is a slide you have to do slides huh and then over in us word would be a poster then you have to do another poster ya that's why because if this' poster then you just do one for both uh who says so cannot you know is it change a bit lah change a bit even change a bit also cannot they say according to ken you must have additional information where you approach someone for conference and papers uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm he makes it so difficult for me you know wherever we discuss something he he wants it to be perfect  word  aiyah don't know he's a perfectionist what what to do right he's only a perfectionist when it comes to work okay when it comes to his house his room it's different why very untidy uh i tell you everything is all over you know where he's to search then he's got to take out this and so you're you're must settle down fast i'm not going to do his laundry or tidy up his room for him and anyway he says he's the kind who wants word  not to be tidied so he he knows where is it in his untidy position no different uh before he get married probably he said this after he get married he want everything to be spick and span lah are you sure ya i think so uh that's you okay that's because serene has been word   word  i don't care ni wen da lor okay wo hui wen da lor nah ni qu wen da uh i see i'll see i'll see i'll see the time limit of the presentation is eight minutes oh there are some that are twelve ten minutes uh does it probably they say there's a limit lah you know maybe you can go definitely below eight minutes uh okay five minutes will do lah hor okay right hor five six five minutes is a bit too short lah probably can uh you see you give an introduc you see you give an introduction of uh tna beta give an introduction of uh i don't need to why must you give introduction all i do is present results right why not but not necessary what i mean depending on the audience uh some may not know what is tna beta and so on give a very brief introduction say twenty seconds i'm very scared you know frankly and then expression and secretion uh inside cells then after this thirty seconds then after that your results and so on maybe should be no problem what eight minutes i don't know i'm very scared huh ya seriously sixteen of june whoa double celebration for you then after this i've to go for that aiyah washington one is another one uh uhm and i haven't even done anything on it yet you know washington one i also haven't do anything what i mean i don't even have results to tell yet leh oh results uh haven't done anything haven't got results haven't got my clones for that one yet you know so how very worried you know left how many more month but you submitted that abstract already right so how did you write that abstract ya we just assume that it's going to be like this the because i got two clones uh one is with the signal sequence one is innate sequence uh huh so assume that not me okay dr yap says just assume that the signal sequence is comparatively the same lah for uhm i see i see well like that lor i'll ask kee cheng about it lor so ask kee cheng so you're supposed to carry out experiments and then uh prove that lah ya ya  two ladies from china came in - spoke in mandarin  anyway by the way they have some codes you see signals you know where nobody will understand no we don't is that right anyway actually i was thinking of sending him the newspaper article i've already cut but i don't know whether they will say anything or not fax to him uh you mean ya i don't know word  i mean down here should be alright but i don't know about the other side because i i pay why you mean they are very stern and strict about i really do not know i thought you were there before i mean i never go through faxes and so on you know but when i was in germany i word  they're quite alright you mean they were alright  what do you mean by they were alright in the sense that whatever that was faxed under my name they just give it to me lah they don't really question or anything like that you see but i don't know about taxes we are we are doing a a a mini-project testing our voice we're sending this to kenneth ya ya really we'll send this to kenneth then he'll play and then hopefully he'll remember her sweet voice you see you mean her ugly voice maybe they selected all the papers first no they already tell you that it's officially selected already ya meaybe the the posters that one they send later the talks probably they give you word  ya don't try and flatter me okay i don't count this probably but this' a to prc lady) the point is that i was asking for a poster they gave me a talk i'm supposed to present a talk and it's so nerve-racking that i don't want that with talk by the way they have upgraded her to uh dr helen chai please lah i mean i mean serious you know i don't want to have a talk you know how come this company this company is a very famous company you know is it ya word company i think one of the first big brother company in singapore to produce word   
Singapore	then i said well this guy's in trouble because like jerk jerk jerk jerk so i was thinking okay never mind maybe it's just the first few stops uhm but it happened the whole way through you see sighs  so i just had to complain but i did i did tell the lady at sbs like no most of our one five seven drivers are very nice people it's only this one that's giving you trouble they're afraid of

at all i don't suppose i couldn't send the kids for delicate testing what  laughs  if you wait a while i'm sure kenneth will walk in here and say anybody wants to get a prize i doubt he'll give those away uhm you never know he gave away word  ya but no it's coming to the cinema it's not that hot you know that that well i haven't heard that delicatesen word is coming we should know i hope so we

mark keet warned me but it's chinese you see there's a chinese who who's gone to come for ya i guess so but then movies is so expensive now it's five bucks that's why the difference isn't that great

provision shop ya word  doesn't mean that it's you know less being less than what i can get at ntuc are these the shoes you bought at studio no these this the tab word bought at that espirit oh which

really look quite right because it looks too uhm it's very thin at the top it's very narrow here right ya ya i think so quite thin ve very narrow ya the top ya so your toes all nearly stick out but they don't stick out i've never tried it word  i know but i don't want to buy shoes on studio any more why because i see so many women at studio buying shoes call it snob value what do i care snob i am a snob do you have your word underneath  word underneath word  i heard from maggie i have not gone to see not word  all those are gone you know sure but you saw them briefly like how how is it two three minutes ago like word went through the store and seen it  word 'a' sam word like fifty in the houses which part of the store is this the shoes shoe section uh i didn't you know i didn't take a look in all it was very weird because they bunched it up with their own house label oh  word so you may not have word  too front i usually just zip by that area and i just take a look uhm too many women and i just like ya ya go somewhere else yesterday no not yesterday i think on the day before when i went through browsing through that place uhm i think they only had three or four styles left

but they are cheaper than shoes and clothes so i can buy more that is perverse watching it was word  can't afford it seventeen dollars times ten hundred and seventy you could have bought a pair of shoes instead of going deaf what deaf you would have a good pair ten uh wow you've bought more than ten for sure ya oh oh yes uhm uhm yeah yes yes yes since when i don't know i really uhm you should buy a cd pair then you can join us what for on our cd buying it's really it's quite alright i will have poetry in that trickle shop order for me you know they stain that one uh oh boy oh word  it's so

hilarious to think that heather who can tell me we went to the village we ya we went here we go a-haying i always wondered why it's a-haying' i said 'a-haying according to the readings i have it's a-maying oh no wonder now it makes sense a-maying how many years did she sing a-haying i don't know but i don't blame her why i would have got a-haying also tia bo you're very good for government word  ah you're very good you know you haven't said anything in peranakan yet oh how come you were word what i'm not word  oh well i do but you know yes because my mother has not cropped up in conversation tsk it's true tell me about it i would not gossip about it cinema you can hor excuse me everybody in the cinema was sitting word with my mother same thing hor hor hor you hear that distinctive hor hor word  ya aiyoh coming from somewhere in the cinema hor you know my  word long hair but the sound system was bad ya what was wrong with the word  now mark keet says it' because capitol is that we're not really convinced but i haven't really heard it like that before really well i can't say because that was you haven' gone to many movies at capitol yeah ya i can't remember the last time i've been to capitol i mean going last night was such a change whoa wha  are you serious yes no last time i watched capitol was word  dismal and dim you know can get raped or not  word  no not like yesterday 'whoa' 
Singapore	for his a e he he he did my family do you know who's jonathan no jonathan that one lah mixed lah uh half uh indian half chinese he i mean he so what we are you sort of like church friends ah you were so natural oh you only had one case study ya oh he had two oh all of you for a.e.s you all went around collecting data no it a.e.s mine not collecting data his was so we i had to like secretly tape conversations within my family i did my brother and and this friend talking about something they like their hobby cds so they're yakking and yakking and yakking over the phone nuh no they were yakking in the room so i just word  left their recorder there really it was so wonderful oh all the scarly all came out ya i know for for ours worse because we i taped the fam you see if it's just me and my parents then it's it's okay you see but then my godma came into the picture and then her friend came into the picture and then everybody started talking so there was a mixture teochew you know english word  word  it's quite word  you see when my relatives get together you hear cantonese baba english ya then i speak to my cantonese relatives in baba ya boy that yesterday i saw the the docu you know which one uhm archie's mental or illness in  word what do you think it's very bad why i didn't even have time to think about the structure i didn't even have time to think about the word  or word  the the picture's very rushed very emotional right no i i just that ethical problem put me off because she did i i i don't know whether word told you i heard she i heard she word the faces or blotched out the faces but then on on other shots i saw them then what's the point see she had this media case study okay this uh mentally ill man okay he he uh okay she when she introduced him that time you could see that she didn't really want to show his face you see that's fine and then she showed one part where she's introducing the mother you see so you think there is nothing wrong you know because uhm she didn't really set out to hide their faces you see so there's this shot of the mother walking you see walking to uh the the dining table okay to to get medicine for the son and she walked towards the dining table you can see obviously that that you know the lights all coming from the window you know so if they they wanted to like cover her face word okay that's fine then then after that you can't see her because she cut to her legs walking and then cut to her shot of her at the table already you see the next thing you know they cut to this shot of her where the camera was taking by the side so it's already quite dark you know the glow uh you know the glare and all that is no longer there you know and you could see the mother you could see the mother and then she says ah seng uh you know come what's the point like that you see no see so for for me i thought that this is nothing you know i thought that there was no attempt actually you know to to hide their face you know then when the interview came on it was in dark silhouette and the woman was speaking very emotionally she cried you see you know what i mean or not she's speaking and then she was crying you see then you knew oh no she was supposed to hide the woman's face but how come i saw maybe you should ask archie must you know i i'm going to tell i'm i think it's ethical problem because i i unless the lady agreed to be filmed later on i can put me off or either that or she no but if she agreed didn't she didn't tell her what she's filming it's bluff lah come on you know that's quite it's very unfair to the family what it's very unfair and then never mind you know okay then you see you know there's this uhm then after that they cut away to the mother talking about her the her her psycho son right uhm so he he's at the void deck you know downstairs you know those stone seats ya ya so he's puffing away you see ah then so they cut to this wide shot he's alone talking to himself smoking wide shot but the angle the camera is high you see uh huh and you can see the man's face  laughs  you see and then later they cut to his eyes then they cut to his his hands holding the cigarettes and then you can see the face then slowly it's like photo fade you're beginning to see the whole face you know then what's the point i was so disgusted you know and then they cut from another part okay where he's talking to himself in hawker centre okay she took a back shot so obviously she didn't want to show his face but in in terms of dealing with issues was it i was so upset with that i didn't even think much of the issues you know so i was i was thinking it's so disgusting you know and the problem is is is the whole series over no over already how many three only uh three the divorce one just finished how was the divorce one i don't know lah but you know very depressing lah entire three-week you know the way they did the trainers you know whoa very sad that's the way it is what but anyway the the mentally ill one in terms of issues i felt that i didn't learn anything more it's like the usual things that you would ask the old you know mentally ill people how you cope the difficulty no no no not how they cope you know but uhm how how  word  difficult it is for them to like word  that's all lah you see but then it wasn't well-rounded because they kept on saying you know from from the perspective so it's just milking sympathy ya because they kept on saying that these poor chaps not not hard hard look lah at at the you know uh uh employers don't want to give them a a a a job you know poor things and all that you see so it's just like mental illness awareness kind of thing nothing deeper they didn't get the they didn't get employers' point of view on why certain mentally ill people they're looking into it may not be suitable that is the one you know they're doing you must have an answer your docu can't be one-sided what but in the end you all saying that ya these poor chaps you know ya trying so having ya having a hard time you know can't integrate into society it's all their fault so i i i don't know lah i ah i went for the health screening just now how cholesterol level safe really are they still having it on now no more already aiyoh but i paid five dollars i wanted to you know i called you at nine-thirty i went down already i know i called you then see how much blood did they one jar a lot uh no lah one tube uh one tube that's a lot just to find out the sugar and the cholesterol lah aiyah i should have gone and the the what it was so messy don't know whether the reading's correct whether it is really my reading or somebody else's but the needles are all disposables right i hope so no they are my brother says now they have all moved towards disposables already i'm sure there are a number of hiv positive people there ya eeeee no but if you you should have tested for aids on the word  uh uh no lah what for then people won't know you see no if they do that our dear bachtiar will be most oh he's on leave don't worry he'll be most aghast why he doesn't want to know no he says that it's it's an intrusion invasion of a person's privacy if you just test for hiv without asking for permission which is true lah you see no but i think as long as you go to a government clinic and you know that they are going to test for hiv then you're then it's okay you have no right already ya you've you you know that definitely word you go there knowing what ya but then again then they'll say why in the first place must the government you know do that that means whenever you test for blood they will test for hiv also i mean like you go and say you go and say can you test my blood level can you test cholesterol but you know how how this based on you you see you give them permission test for blood test for i mean test for sugar test for cholesterol but you don't say if you say don't test for hiv they can't then don't go to a government clinic uh huh aiyah i don't know lah this hiv thing is so actually there are so many issues you know even if you talk about aids you know uhm uhm you know the docu that you did uhm okay that's one part that's only one part only ya docu cannot you know do everything there's a lot more ya but but thought of looking into rights and all that ya like like this thing that you just brought up you see i mean on the one hand bachtiar does have a point to make you see i mean no matter what you have a right to say that what my body should be tested for uhm you know what i mean or not if if you don't want to know whether you got cancer or not you know you you you just don't test for it they can't test you without your permission you see you know but then uh on the other hand there are other you know things lah i think they should set up anonymous testing uhm that's what he suggested anonymous testing ya in other words but then you see you you don't leave you don't even leave your name you know you don't leave your name you record uh oh then you go back and you just go there they give you a number then you just quote that number okay okay then after that the

oath oh under oath those wear black one is it yanamamo word  how much are you selling for a bottle three fifty uhm three fifty i think quite reasonable price at least for fifteen fifteen bottles onwards word uhm so you should be making hundred percent hundred percent ya what five bottles get the your margin is oh fifty percent uh  uhm that's that is if we that is if you no margin is more hit the target my cost price is only a dollar oh the margin for a dollar is 'a' but you're talking about my margin is two fifty you're selling thirty odd thirty bottles right ya fifteen is breakeven ya that means the other fifteen is pure profit what ya lah word  so fifty percent what ya lah fifty percent nuh fifty percent margin nuh have you calculated your bottles and your rental those uh ya ya everything hah come on lah bizad how would i know i was raking my brains how to call it how to calculate a breakeven point 'a' go use your contribution margin and calculate that's the right way you know ya then put in the fixed cost plus the variable cost ya and plus the x-factor which is all my you know those uh label lah time time and all the gas your labour must be very expensive costed in also i'm sure not right huh i costed in labour too ya about twenty twenty twenty cents extra lah that means the actual raw material is only about eighty cents only 
Singapore	okay what what's uh what's news today uh i thought of asking you whether you want me to bring your  word you know oh no later huh when you're free i don't want it now 'cos i i'm trying to get some uhm want you to get some baggage for our trip you know coming trip ya now this morning i just i've just got the no no not this one what baggage no the luggage for our trip so i don't have to get now lah no no not now not now okay this morning i got some presents for for james and uh james and clarence and doctor chong we're going to miss four weddings uhm when we go away so uh i'm wrap i've been wrapping presents this morning but i thought i was supposed to write for uh for james  word  you've written already no no no i've written already okay i've got the presents ready and i've written ya i'll fetch them in in the afternoon lah huh i'll fetch in the afternoon do you have james's uh address i i've got it ya let me see what it is and then pick him up here uhm james word seven word  road is it right ya seven word  uhm that's why your dad used to stay uhm some one decade ago uhm right they must have shifted from lorong j ya the last time i saw them was uh some time ago lah i saw them in lorong j mrs chua rang this morning she's wondering whether she's invited to tonight's dinner and uhm i told her that she was mrs lim had taken for granted that she was going and there was no need to send a special invitation to her she said anyway she just came back from uh the rockies and she says that the weather there is warm not cool as we as we thought it would be and surprisingly she said the rocky the word  where she stayed for two days was also warm uhm so how long was she there in the canada fifteen days fifteen days with her two daughters and son-in-law one son-in-law uhm uhm and she said that uhm she enjoyed it very much she says the scenery is one of the best and she she also mentioned that she went up to the uh summer fraser university and the view from there is excellent uhm she says the architecture too is good but she doesn't think that that building deserves first prize in the uhm something like architectural uh competi competition is it when did they get first prize i didn't know it seems there was some competition uhm of architectural designs and summer fraser university topped oh that's that's very good what uhm huh uhm cos our children love that place very much huh since they've been there for about four years she says the building is nice but not that wonderful but the view is from there is excellent but i think the word building is unusual you know because all these buildings are connected to one another and there's no exposure to the rain and the sun i think that was what word told us last time wasn't it ya it seems ya ya uhm eh actually we should walk round the buildings we have not walked we have not even been into the main uh building itself oh we managed to see quite a lot during the convocation sam's convocation ya that ya that's the uhm that's the open space itself but not the the halls and the enclosed areas uhm we did go in a short while i remember i think that was a few years back remember or not uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm then we went to ya we went inside the building itself uhm and then uh my friend esther she also just came back from i think melbourne she went to attend her son's convocation in melbourne how many people will be there tonight uh probably twelve probably twelve uhm uhm uhm that would include the my ex-colleagues uhm uhm and the three people i went holidaying with recently gracie uh cel and hock eng and where will it be tonight word  uh singapore's swimming club hor hope won't end too late tonight no i don't think so anyway you'll be having your meeting uhm what time will your meeting end i think uh we should end by nine-thirty not uh the latest should be ten but i don't think it will stretch as long as ten o'clock would it uhm so far we had the meetings ending only about nine thirty oh ya ya by the end uh sam and karen won't be going with you because they think that uh it's a little inconvenient for victor uh vin not victor vincent to you know to keep them company till about ten and also vincent would be actually having dinner at her uhm's his uhm's uhm place uhm so they they rang just now to ask me whether i could ask victor to allow them to use his computer uhm uhm have you asked victor already not yet i only spoke to kathleen but then the we we had to cut short our conversation because she had an incoming call at her office you know so so he wants to do it tomorrow word  no tonight tonight tonight i mean if he's unable to finish he says he'll carry on tomorrow night ya it's more convenient because uh after all they're only a few doors away from here ya just a short distance but vincent's place is too far it's bishan and i think uh i don't think it'll be very convenient for them to go a few times ya and also lucy rang up to ask me whether i would be able to fry some bee hoon for tomorrow night's function not tomorrow saturday oh saturday saturday that's right ya so i told her that hemelia is very new at cooking and she may or may not be able to do a good job out of out of it uhm so that's for the time being uh i told her that i would just say 'yes' and if i can think of another dish i'll do that dish but bee hoon would be very good word if she can fry bee hoon no she's got michelle to do some uh sambal sambal prawns i think and others are doing the chicken and the batch word  and some desserts i think i'll prepare some desserts for them also hemelia can cook the fish ball or the meat ball uh meat ball ya can ask her do that she's quite good at it anyway they want a staple bee hoon is a staple are we expected to be here on saturday night well they ask if we would be like to be home uhm they want to include us in the dinner but uhm i don't know i see we'll go we'll have our swim in the afternoon and then we'll see we we don't have to rush back for the occasion but if we are home we'll join them if not we will see what we what else will it be for the regional fellowship group or the christian education program no no no no this is for the cep christian education group uhm and they are expecting around twelve people i thought you told me about twenty people no twenty are in the list of uh participants uhm but twelve will be coming for tonight's uh to saturday's function uhm uhm so we have our swim first in the afternoon right uhm uhm and then let us take our time coming back will we have dinner first ya or shall we join them for dinner uh it's up to us it's up to us then we should uhm but if we join them for dinner that means we have to come back at a certain time uhm uhm uhm huh whereas if we just stay on in the club for a few hours and we can come after they finish their dinner uhm ya huh that's right and we can join them for the meeting right what meeting are they having i thought they are having a meeting aren't they is it i don't know i thought it was just some uh just a get-together get-together i'm sure there will be a message uh ya sure somebody will be giving a short talk lah uhm uhm uhm perhaps vincent will be giving a short talk uhm i don't know you see he didn't mention that uhm so alex will be word  how's your alex alex will be in the cep word  alex in a different group altogether uhm ya what's uh your program for sunday uh uh i heard from mama that uhm nai kiaw's father has just undergone an operation uhm uhm i'm not sure what the operation is and her mother is when was that uhm just a three days back i think and if which hospital was that gh uhm well if we are not going anywhere in the afternoon on sunday we might drop in just drop in and visit him lah you want won't be too rush is it sunday afternoon lah or even before going out in the evening see uh and her mother it seems has is not feeling well too she's due to go back to toronto on the ninth of may but now she's got to uh either cancel her trip or postpone her trip uhm this speaker this tape recorder and speaker is very interesting small thing like that and it's it's supposed to take uh take eh to catch your voice from a long distance is it yeah i think this is called a uni- word microphone  word  uhm this morning i was listening to the tape i bought from malacca some years back cantigas cantigas i think is portuguese music portuguese singing portuguese uh singing is very lively oh ya by the way uh loonie rang up last night loonie i i'm not sure whether he rang from singapore or from philippines he didn't indicate that but he rang i don't i don't know why he rang also ya i i don't know whether to bring up the matter to elders in his unit uh tomorrow evening uhm i think it's not necessary huh don't no need lah doesn't doesn't uh really uh interest them now aileen hu's uh the the dinner is on for tuesday uhm uhm where will it be i think it should be at the singapore let me see airlines club what do you call it sia club uhm uhm sia club ya seems that anybody could go there eh for the dinner or for for the meals it's different for our club uhm our club is so exclusive i i i don't know the fact that they have to charge visitors who come in for just for a meal well they've got their reason i suppose otherwise there'll be all sorts of all all sorts of people coming in ya but if members uh members sign them in it's okay what i mean shouldn't shouldn't uh make it that difficult for members to have a guest for dinner or for lunch or of course lunch-time it's anybody can come in on work on working days not on weekends nor public holidays but uhm working days they allow that uhm you see in chinese swimming club they have a separate entrance going to the restaurant so people use just use that entrance and come out exactly in the same way uhm whereas in our club uh you have entrance going to the swimming pool as well as to the billiards room as well as to uh you know the other facilities rooms anyway i don't like the chinese swimming club  it's so much like a little uh uh uh a mini-china uhm the colour is blue and the new uh pool with its building has got such uh poor taste the archi architecture is such it's chinese what that's the architecture is so bad i mean that's typical chinese what word  i i don't know i feel as thouh i'm in china when i see  word look at that building i'm in that in that ang in that space there ya uhm what we don't really appreciate is enclosed feeling that we get when we go there whereas we it's so different from our from the changi beach club uhm uhm where you have the sea right in front of you and the breeze uhm 
Singapore	 word mummy ha what time did you come back about eleven something ya eleven something how was the show told you lor i saw two plays uhm two plays then i went to the how long how long was each play half an hour that's all half an hour ya short plays what is it ha what is it one was called bernard story and then the other one is local ya they are all local plays all local plays ya written by word  which group which group acted no particular group how can it's just ya it's just organized by theatreworks and then they ya individual people just individually go and do their they put up productions i mean no group just individuals ya just can't imagine ya can aiyah drama people mah very easy one uh you just you just people i know don't think so people i know  laughs  what's the uh what bernard what bernard bernard story it's about this bernard story this guy lah you know this guy he's raped this woman and then explains how come he became like that you know he's always been he was always being oppressed by  word women one performer or two performers two two two performers ya they played up different roles lah good or not good acting ya ya good acting word  uhm who's the director don't know can't remember  laughs then the other one that one i saw oh directed by my friend siok lian oh sok siok lian nuh that one nus ya huh was was she at nus last time ya ya ya i think so uhm directed by her ya and then what also no no particular group no just a loose group ya brought together yep what what's the story what's the title red man green man  laughs  like the lights the traffic lights ya exactly it's about this is it about the traffic lights ya there was this guy who's trying to cross the traffic lights ya ya ya this guy was trying to cross the traffic lights and and it's all about making choices one nuh aiyah no wonder making choices and playing by the rules and stuff like that you know living by the rules and making choices all that lah uhm uhm ya so so very short ya how many performance that one has got four then then after that you mean one play followed the other ya they have about there were few plays every night uhm like at seven forty-five tthere're a choice of three plays where where do they perform black box or oh oh wrong place, not plays word  you know fort canning ya the building right ya then there's this courtyard outside yes space right ya so the different spots there you see you mean it's free admission or what no you got to pay lah how how do they collect anything collect what oh that you pay for to entry to the whole thing you see where's the entrance i mean it's it's a whole park you see oh it's just at the you know near the black box that building lah uh huh that the building by the black box so there'll be people who swarm word in without buying any tickets uh no you can't because they have why they have an entrance at the foot of the you know you know you were you the foot of the hill ya near the hill oh that that's where they collect the tickets ya or they collect money also they collect the word you want tickets so you you pay and then you enter and you can see anything on the hill yep anything on the hill uhm how much fifteen dollars for a night per night uh thirty dollars for the whole season that's cheap thirty dollars for a whole season that means the whole that means for what something like so it's better than ten twelve days you get better than you just go one day and pay fifteen dollars ya two days is already thirty dollars uhm uhm i paid fifteen so much cheaper dollars for season ticket oh student yep oh i see so you can go any night yep any night with fifteen dollars lah worth it ya any drinks any food ya you can buy drinks and food oh i thought free nah nah then they got band isn't it oh ya every night band won't one thing disturb the other uhm no see they arrange it so that when the plays in the open air are going on the bands are not performing uhm see then when the plays in the open air are over the bands perform but then the black box while the other plays go on in the building in the black box and and and other places another place ya and then the films also isn't it ya so you you hor they got some 'ge lan' film i saw it was ya ya live you know uhm uhm those chinese old chinese films ya who's ge lan huh ge lan was uhm a star you know during the time when there was a ling chui and all that you see uh si qian jing uh in the nineteen fifties sixties uh huh ya who are the si qian jing oh she she she could sing and dance lah oh so there was a film she made called uh mum bo girl she wasn't called the si qian jing word  si qian jing was ling chui ling chui ge lan isn't it i thought ling chui ge lan that group lor about the same time as lin tai you know ling tai i know ah about the same about but they belong to different organizations lin tai belonged to shaw brothers i think uhm and ge lan belonged to cathay organization oh ya so and then what time you you can enter at what time and finish off at what time anytime anytime you go anytime anytime ya and then come out anytime but the whole thing ends what time uh well eleven about eleven the whole thing ends uhm i see ya but that were uh were there lots of people oh ya uhm ya so it's quite successful lah ya i think so actually uhm yuh theatreworks was it tay tong or somebody who rang me up uhm they wanted chinese opera you see ha ya aiyoh laughs  because they thought opera on the hill and i think they got beijing opera you know they got word  ya ya they got word  from i don't know they've performed already is it ya oh i thought i wanted to go and see so they asked us to go you see uhm uhm then because we also had our festival uh uhm so i said we're very busy but if the timing fits uh might be we could you see uhm then i asked him about pricing lah uhm supposing you know if it is open air uh it would be nice to have live music right uhm musicians and all that playing uh uhm so if you have live musicians uh then the cost would go up uhm ya and if you've taped music of course it would be very cheap nuh not nice ya but won't be nice so i thought you know taped music won't be so effective anyway i've told them the cost but they never came back to me it's probably too expensive probably too expensive ya i wonder how much they pay all these charge word and then i i told them you know they could even have the china people perform right ya ya for example 'lan ma' uh the guests uh guests that will be very nice isn't it ya but i suppose they probably couldn't budget so much to pay for it uhm uhm so the whole thing was out lah uhm i mean they they never contacted me again uhm uhm uhm but it's quite a thing ya it's quite fun and then it is a nice uh atmosphere you know ya you have the hill if people go then it's very enjoyable ya ya it's very nice what last mon monday we went right uhm and then so we finished watching haresh's play and then we went to how long was haresh's play one hour his was long lah what was it about about three friends i mean two sisters and their friend uhm and how one of the girls lah uhm is uhm likes to doesn't want change uhm doesn't want changes in her life you see uhm and the other two want changes so the friend goes off to philippines to look for his parents his real parents uhm and then the girl's sister moves out of the house because she says that too many ghosts in the house too many too many too much burden lah of the past she wants to she wants change lah so it's about that kind of thing lah was it in the open air or no it was in black box black box but not many people can see isn't it it's a small theatre word  ya but enough lah i mean if you go there every night so ya uhm so is necessary stage performing ya word  uhm uhm uhm no talks and all that nuh nope it's just word  the band local band ya all local bands good or not very good very good ya ha very good what what did they play their own music and other people's music lor ya some uh one night i saw rock band different different types uh yeah yeah like those the ones that i was playing on the cd that night lor uhm but no oriental music uh no no uhm ya anyway what do you think huh do you think it's a it's a good idea one thing is ya i think it's fun there's a lot of fun there's a lot of fun uhm very good lah so the people who were trained are youngsters got some ang mos got a lot of kwai lo uh no there are more there are more locals than there are ang mos huh then got some very yuppie yuppie types then some parents bring their kiddies along lah word kiddies ya ha but mostly very young lah huh kiddies ya they won't appreciate that's why some of the things that's why ya then some of the plays word  some of the plays are marked with an asterisk ah then they say these plays contain strong language and adult abuse so to warn you lah don't bring your children to watch these kinds of stuff  laughs  ya ya some are like that ya i see how long it'll last uh one month three weeks or what the third what fourteen or something word but it clashes with the film fes isn't it ya everything clashes with film fes ya ya everything clashes with film fes lor then just before film fes uhm at that european community film fes oh ya but that was before the film fes so it's not so bad you see ya ya but then it's like you know too close ya then you got to spend so much money uhm and so much time uhm ya is that film fes is still on uh yep until next sunday oh so it really clashes uh uhm i don't know why they don't space it out properly uh ya don't know lah uhm there's a lot of explanations and and all that then june got arts fes ya june got arts fes so whoa this year full of fes tiring lah hor ya sometimes okay lah i mean it's probably the same crowd who go to film fes and arts fes  ya the same people what a lot of yuppies also go to this and it's amazing you know the shows uh most of the films are i think sold out you know uhm uhm ya but film fes usually like that ya you find it hard to guide get get tickets ya but then then it's like you know the rest of the year we don't have very good stuff in the local cinemas uhm then but then when the film fes comes around people snap up the tickets so that means there is a market for for this kind of more unusual films not really you know i mean because there's a film fes sort of people know that these things are on if you space it out and you put it on the commercial market nuh uhm uhm then you may miss it you know market you then you must publicize it market it  word  and then the commercial market uh for this type of film uh it won't last long you see couple of days uh then by the time you get to know about it it's off right ya that's why they they don't publicize their stuff properly especially cathay whereas in the film fes it's all concentrated ya and they have publicity whereas like you know a lot of commercial cinemas they don't publicize their films so couple of good films come to cathay you know uhm go to picture house or whatever and then you miss they're not publicized at all there's no write-up about them you know nothing about them three days later they're gone uhm so i figured it out cathay's tac tactic is uh they bring in the big films right uhm and then in between the big films they throw in filler movies uhm and i think that sometimes the filler movies are worth watching people would go and watch if only you promote the movies i think you can earn even more money but maybe they think it's too much money to spend on advertisements ya ya but it's it's such a waste you know ya such a waste 
Singapore	so what did you do yesterday well i went for a swim and i made a pizza at home yes then where where else you mean yes where else i thought you were supposed to bring your parents out for din

prepared why don't you go straight from lunch because it's you mean why don't we go straight from lunch yes because i have a lunch appointment no then why don't we go direct because it's at two thirty and we've got to check the rooms everything the room's uhm tidied up and everything else that's a good point but i need to tidy myself up no that's not a good point who is this chris guy that's asking

else is new are you taking leave tomorrow uh i might i i wanted to feel the effect of the half day leave on saturday so you applied already yes i have ah okay it has been approved so why don't you go ahead i might otherwise you will regret it which canteen uh do you like best of all this oh no what a horrible question okay let's change the subject okay have you read the papers today no what's new no i haven't read it no but uhm did you about the letter in the forum did you read the letter in the forum about the pass with merit and a lot objections ah ya did you did you read it no i just read that they were not informed and they were not happy about not being informed no no no this letter in the forum page okay and this guy got's a valid very valid point that what's the point of having pass with merit it should be a finer distinction like distinction and then ordinary pass that's all because they don't know what pass with merit means at all how can you say it's not been classified right properly ya it's not been properly told it's not well thought of uh that whole scheme no and they implement it without actually you know uh any publicity informing anybody about it right so even the future the potential employers ah will not even know what what it means what difference it makes if i employ it's just suddenly implemented yes in fact students here somebody from uhm a parent call me up and and ask me uh can they start applying for honours immediately since the daughter got pass with merit oh then i said no it does not mean automatic uh automatic entry you see ya so they're very proud of their children getting pass with merit shouldn't they word  oh poor disillusion people yes we have about five six minutes to go let's give him ten minutes after all we're not being paid yes we're not being paid what do you think cheap labour or what free labour not even cheap so yesterday she came you know the history of university writer ya i know she spent some time ya ask sally that after the recording what the latest on that so she can do interviews ah so how are your kids oh fine as ever i'm glad to say is nichole better now no no she has thank you    25 may 1992

another friend's wedding from my church uh did robin invited you ya i had an invitation card but happened that there are two weddings so i only had to attend one and some more where is the wedding where is the place uh place is at near serangoon serangoon area the people's bible church is it somewhere near the new world the former new world no no no it's at uh upper serangoon near the upper paya lebar upper serangoon junction so did you go to word   word  no robin did not invite me oh i see did he invite all the branch people no i'm not so sure who he invited i think he should lah uhm because usually for wedding for church wedding usually the person can invite many people oh you mean the whole company uh it's unlike the wedding dinner which you have to pay more oh but sometimes it's because they they also have a quota because they church cannot accommodate so many people your relatives and your church friends your church your church friends will take up maybe hundred over but if the church is big enough it can include many people no lah normally the uh church size is about a big a big one could be a hundred hundred can can can take a thousand can take two thousand but

tour group uhm tour group may be possible lah but then we're thinking the dates may be a bit of a problem yes and also a number of days we want to be there so which group and i am and also the air ticket we are using our own air tickets so if we join them but you can go with that then you get a tour group  word ah yes this is possible but the the the timing must be right uh i believe you will be going to shen zhen also right ah yes so we are thinking if we have some relatives there so if we can we go there and see whether there are any tour groups like one day tour to shen zhen one day tour to sen zhen uh so we can join them lah yes i believe so so we go there and look for the tour agent now it is very popular so instead of looking here we go there and look uh 
Singapore	oh you mean for the performance no i mean for the re for for the rehearsals for oh ya ah actually that's a that's good you know because if we use the british council's space ya then we have space here and jenna's cast can can rehearse here ya okay and ya but actually it was quite mean of word to say that it's it's bad space because we'll we've to get to you know then after they will not sponsor us next time oh i see what you mean ya no actually it's not a bad space i think i think he doesn't he's not used to working in a black box situation so he doesn't like the substition word either ya lah don't know lah whatever because i think we should show him some of the the video tapes that we've done or show some substitution word  ya actually you know we should show him video tape i'm going to get it i'm going to pass show him just those i'm going to pass him scripts and all that kind of thing no why don't we have some video tapes here right ya shall we just very quickly duplicate them and give him uhm uhm those who i don't duplicate i don't want to keep word  script i don't mind okay word  no but you can takes it back if if he doesn't have time what he's staying in don't know what hotel i'm sure they've got a video right oh why don't we lend him those who can't teach then then you can see what you can do to the script ya still got video tape right ya what else more more ya lanterns lanterns lanterns will be quite a good taping because of the festival no 'lanterns' was 'lanterns' was at the arts festival  word  oh but because no my concern is that i i think that he should change his mind about the substation well i i don't want to participate in any change mind my word changing word no we just show we just give him a a range of tapes from the drama centre ones as well as the substation ones lah okay lah right or not ya and then he can have a look at them and see whether that a good idea or not but i very hungry you know how you okay you ask you ask her to come here i ask her to come here and then and then we see how lah she's supposed to buy two plants for me you see i'm going to wipe my front lights are missing i only buy one oh no because of dickie she come here then ta bao is it ya whatever she can buy something and come no lah 'a' should we call her ask her buy something and come no lah no lah no uh i think we should go out let's take a break from this place if you don't mind ya or actually no but if we go out then we should have called her to meet wait wait no like at environment building no want us show want to show her the place also what we must do our tour our okay okay this is the necessary studio the necessary loo kind of thing then uhm she comes up here i take the plug and go and keep then you can you get ready you're going to the bank right if we go out we go out you know ya ya right ya so uhm is alvin staying here ya so i'm going i go down to skoob books first and get the books ya and the the lens and then uhm uh do you want to meet and come back or uhm then can share cab or do you mean word like take mrt and walk i'll be going to two places you call me lah after you go to the doctor you're going parklane right ya after you go there you'll i will most probably depending on what time because i think that doctor has a very long lunch-break like from eleven to three or something like that why don't you call him first before we go down no i'll check my card you check your card ya have a look and see if you no call him you know see whether he got he got uh uh time for you because otherwise he's got too many appointments lined up ya okay and then you have a problem then i'll i'll stay at skoob books lah when you're you'll call me when you finish or something ya okay then the ah never going to get my things done what things uh aiyah all my word fifteen minutes the the the life scripts beng chiak is very upset just now i don't blame her ya she was i've never seen her so when she get upset uh she want to break down and cry right if she get upset she'll like 'yes you want talk to me' ya uhm no why i'm why i'm annoyed about is that when i spoke to enita enita she said she doesn't want to do it so okay fine uhm she said then she said like actually shoberth can do it but it's just that they didn't communicate properly and all that with beng kiang all that i said whatever then i said then she explained i said no you don't have to explain i i'll just do it she said why are you not upset i said well i'd rather not get emotional about these things i i'll just be functional and and and detached and practical then she said like okay that's good then uhm she said will you call beng kiang i said i will call beng kiang but not to tell her that you don't want to do it but i think you should call her and tell her that you don't want to do it but i'll call beng kiang later and just talk about okay so now what we do but what i'm most annoyed about is that she called beng kiang and she told beng kiang to call that i will talk to her you know and said beng kiang called me word  yes you want to talk to me i said uhm ya did enita call you said she said yes then i said uhm so did did she tell you she can't do it she said yes so you want to talk to me about what you know like uh ya i thought we know you'd better talk about what other possibilites there are and all that kind of thing no what what i was really annoyed with enita was was okay she she she blamed beng kiang for the shobun thing you know what i mean ya as in like it's it's uhm uhm they never communicate she never explain properly to her and now because at the end of the day word  what it means is enita cannot go on holiday you know what i mean or not i can't help thinking that even if she's concerned about shobun i can't help thinking that that that at the end of the day it's because if or or it doesn't work out she cannot go on holiday ya you know is it and this is very irritating because it's irres i still feel it's irres(irresponsible) that's why she doesn't want to talk to me about it you see because i told her yesterday i think you should do it no but i don't want to be i don't want to like tell people you must do you must not do if you don't want to do don't do just say no or yes i don't want to even hear reasons because you are adult enough to to to to go and rationalize this and you know ya no no because the thing is that why why i felt that uhm one of us had to say it was because uhm on beng kiang's behalf you see because i think beng kiang felt that it's it's very difficult because beng kiang will feel that at the end of the day that we didn't we didn't uhm tsk do anything about it no but these things you just have to like live with it kind i mean look at those who can't teach wants his face pulled out like two weeks before like what i mean you go to him and you say no you must not leave that kind of thing word  i think you should stay and all that no that's different you see but then you see that's different because you you are involved in it alvin's involved in it and we explained blah blah blah blah right the problem with this beng kiang thing is that it's enita you see enita is supposed to be one of us kind of thing and at and while while we we receive word production support and all that then it's like beng kiang says ya uhm you know she asked me that day is is enita always like that does she do this very often i said no as far as i know i said she she does have some time constraints and stuff that's why in in reference to the group she's very clear about it she she cannot come for this she cannot come for that it's okay you see ya but she's clear from the onstart but i said i guess this is an unusual circumstance because she also didn't expect to be here word  to be given the luxury of leave suddenly you see you know what i mean but then it's like if we all if we if we don't say that uhm you have a responsibility to do it then it's like we are being lax you see you know what i mean ya and it's not as if we're offering a lot of of of uhm uhm alternatives to beng kiang ya it's it's at this moment we're very stretched for  word as if we have word  and i told i told enita there and then i said i said i i have to admit my main priority at that point word one week ago is is uhm dawn because dawn hasn't even started you see and and the way enita put it is like okay so the script is not written yet you know so it's alright if i pull out it's not true you see and i i so i told beng kiang i know why she's very panicky so i said let's i i told beng kiang that day in in the that uhm shop even if it's not enita if it's shoberth whoever i said your main priority now is to is to polish up the cast and get the show on the road because she said ya then the script word  in the script will be word and all that i said but i said this is the is you know for the audience you you want the audience word to find out whether it's going to be a good script or not right so you must like you you can't give word make house situation  word where everybody says aiyah don't know this part didn't work don't know whether it's the cast the director or the or the script kind of thing ya so i said if the direction is good and the the cast is good then at least we can say ah okay it's the script this is the problem where but that's constructive you see so ya lah that's why so now we just meet someone who is free for two weeks and who is good and who can just can just do it ya but that's easier said than done tomorrow morning lah what's happening tomorrow morning about just word  okay no that's why i'm very i'm very i'm very uhm confused right now about this because it's like do we do we find someone for her or is shoberth doing it or what no she said she'll go and talk to shoberth and beng kiang beng kiang and if shoberth can't do it then we'll find someone lah okay so word  i told her i said i will ask kah wai she said no it's not a role for kah wai i said okay then we just have to think of someone jowee uh cos' ah ya actually it's something jowee can do seriously but we have to ask her lah but i don't want i rather do i don't want another one of these another 'i did you a favour you owe me one word ' ya ya how uh let's hope word okay we go out we're going where are we going lauhs we're going to eat at environment building ah i don't mind i haven't eaten there for the whole week you all have right ya no i don't mind there's a lot of food stalls there their stuff ya it's quite nice 
Singapore	actually what's wrong lah you know with what being down with illness for a while good break ha i don't know haven't tasted like pain aiyaks and illness  word ya for some time you know uh huh good experience not that i don't know i'm not tsk it's there's a it's not that i want it but it's like you ya don't really mind even if you ah i'm i won't be awfully upset lah ya uhm ya i'll just be sick that's all so long as you know that it's not like life or death you know i mean you know that you're going to pull through it that's alright if you know you're word  even deaf also i don't know uh i mean if if if i'm the one who's going to die it's not so bad you know uh huh if someone i love or or uh huh someone i know is dying that's more painful oh but if you are going to die yourself it's it's alright lah uhm it's not so bad uhm so that's why i see i see actually uh so i i wondered why i brought it up as a prayer item uh huh because deep inside i don't like not really concerned i really hate it huh word  uhm it's not like i'm very frightened you know uhm chicken pox i am very frightened because of the marks that leaves behind vainpot ya ya lah that's it lah cos' i am vainpot for me for me dying would be like uhm tsk terribly self-centred but i don't think they'll be able to manage without me uhm my family uhm you know i mean it's like that so i people have asked me you know whether you prefer uhm your husband to die or you to die first and all that and i've always said better he die first uhm uhm because i think i can take it oh but i think if i die i don't think he can take it oh you know you know what i mean wow ya you know so that that kind of a thing so i i i don't understand this thing when you were saying i mean i don't see it the same way oh like in the sense that it's okay if i die you know uhm to me it is not quite okay if i die oh it is so different uh ya maybe i don't know mine is more like an escape you see uh huh if i die tsk aiyah uhm uhm you know i mean okay lah life is okay you know uhm uhm but i'm not crazy about life you know what i mean  laughs ya ya ya uh i mean i think ya okay there are a lot there is a lot of emptiness although there's a lot of fun and and meaning uhm meaning in it as well lah but you know ya quite bad lah actually ya i don't know maybe you'd have to go through that you know word ya don't know but i'm very frightened when people hor i i like i love uhm in the family and things like that if they should die uh i find that harder to take oh than if i myself find that i'm terminally ill ah but i i don't know i dread to see their ah their their their suffering like that you know word  ng ya that is why because you can't do anything oh you mean their suffering if you die ya ya ya ya that that no no not not only when i die but to for them to see the pain that i'm going through ya ya ya that's to me even more painful than probably what i'm you know ya experiencing that is how i see it lah uhm at this point in time lah actually actually for me uh pain is not so bad you know i hate it when it's it is scars you got a high threshold uh huh and itchiness uh is it itch you know i can't stand the itch uh huh uh huh but i can take pain is it uhm i can't take itch you have experience like you know a word  ya very bad pain oh i have uh or sometimes i've got this abdominal hernia sometimes the pull is very bad oh but uhm but somehow pain is better than itch i hate itch ya it's unbearable and it's it is embarrassing to have to scratch ya i know ya i think that is because i think i am very vain ya i hope to live through life classily lah you know ya even if it is short uh ya lah ya at least if you are if you can live through it quite stylishly uh uhm uh huh it is okay you know and die with classy also uh ya sort of ya i mean don't like ya ya ya so that the last memory of you is still ya that's right this you know that's right such a talk so frivolous uh i'm so terrible i'm so frivolous rachael i can't help being frivolous you're being honest aiyoh so frivolous  word  i don't know whether i'll be able to admit that okay if it were true ya but i guess i do want the good things in life too uh ya but not so concerned about what people think of me  word  uhm so maybe it's it's alright to scratch for me for me it's not what people think uhm uhm of course that sometimes is important uhm uhm uhm but it's how i like to look at myself you see my own self ya i don't like to see myself as like sometimes you sit at home and then the old habits come up uh oh dear the the like like you know you you pick your nose or you or you dig into your toe nails  word  you know you dig into your toe nails when you watch tv uh aiyoh then i suddenly look at myself from outside sort of like distance myself from uh huh and you don't accept that my existence and i just despise myself you see don't like that word  ya it's it's reminding me of hui li before she had chicken pox she was rather vain you know but then she had chicken pox that which left the scar in the middle of her nose i know hey you know she sort of came back and and had to laugh about it ya no choice no choice ya quite terok uh ya quite terok lah if you are that kind ya  sighs so much word the  word the word  uh ya  word it's quite a funny conversation right right ya ah there was an article today in the papers about uhm this guy his surgeon who uhm had a pain himself in his abdominal area and he went to all the tests and uhm you know they really put him through word  plenty of tests and then he had to diagnose himself and it was like you know uhm appendicitis lah but i don't know i don't know what point i'm getting to actually got no point uh just talk about pain and death lah word  real pain he says appendicitis is real pain ya ya ya ruptured appendicitis ya that will real pain no uh some pain some type of pain are very scary because you don't know where you're going ya i think that's it you don't see an end to it ya you know that's right that's why it's scary that's right ya you don't know what the outcome would be uhm otherwise if you expect it uh it's not so bad it's no good i mean you don't feel good but eeee i wonder if i would but it's not as bad as you know some just like when you're when i was on the air-plane uhm uhm and the the my ears were very painful uh huh ya ah you don't know it it's okay it was it was there for like five to ten minutes but it lasted for about twenty minutes oh but during the time i couldn't i i begin to wonder whether it would word any you know actually go off at all ah so that was quite frightening because ah you wonder if it's going to build up into a boom ya explosion then your your ear-drum bursts you know ya that kind of thing ya but toothache is fine headaches are fine eee headaches are terrible to me headaches are terrible it's like whoa i i i really rather die migraines are terrible ya ya when i have them it's like what's the difference oh there's a big difference you know i never know no i i never know the difference you know and i mean i don't know whether what i'm having is migraine migraine migraine or uhm headache is i don't know headache is not so bad it's just the pain in a certain part of the head ya ya but migraine uh is like you see rashes you you that kind of thing you want to ya it's like something pulling my hair like that you know and then i want to throw up as well ya ya but i get that very often maybe it's migraine hey but i don't know what it is but a panadol solves it all should go and see a doctor oh mine came to a point when the panadol didn't solve it ah so i had to go and see him ya then now i'm on this uh medication called migral  word  no lah is it it's very good it takes away instantly is it uh oh maybe i'm not having migraine then maybe because a panadol works more women get it you know than men it seems stress uh stress and maybe like being out in the sun for you know really word  uhm oh i get it after the rain you know i will get it after the rain you have to get it after the rain i will like the last few days i keep getting it is it after the after the rain strange ha ya uhm i don't know i'm the kind of people who don't want that it's like i think it's what the chinese call 'tao hong' in hokkien) really it's the rheumatism in the head so after the rain you get it you know uh huh 'tao hong' is something else lah ya no it's like uh you know 'tsao tsao' in mandarin right last time uh 'tsao tsao' uh ah the chinese general this uh chinese general uh huh what word  he had a headache it was 'tao hong' uh huh oh really and and the i think someone the the wanted to mention something about squeeze it out or something doing something to the head  word  he suspected the guy was doing was going to hurt him or you know kill him oh ya i remember that story so when i've when i've migraine i'll think about 'tsao tsao' oh ya lah there was this this friend of mine who used to go to doctor and said oh i have migraine and doctor said no you have headache you know i mean uhm like after a while they don't believe you ya no you uhm they got to monitor you lah uhm uhm and then you tell them what kind it is 
Singapore	uh and i find that they are well-organised ya what they do right from beginning uh source out speakers okay they get speakers they would have a provisional list uh ya uh and then quickly have an initial initial promotion and see what is the uh response first that's very professional have response and then second round more detailed it's like uh gradually building up you know ya even the pamphlets they'll say not just who should attend but give elaborate uh the the content of the makes a lot of difference that's right i do not know what happened because when i first spoke to student  word i checked with them a few things i thought that chances of success will be very high you know but i don't know what happened on the last two months suddenly the thing becomes so quiet that's why i got worried about months ago i thought this thing's off i called up and uh rosrena told me that she'll be resigning so i think the the whole thing got quiet off you know obviously and i i think she didn't tell the her employer until two weeks ago i see that's very bad ya obviously she could have been because she's leaving right she could have been just leaving this matter to another person ya or just not do anything so that these people would take i i must say that these two girls uh uh they brave the embarrassment that's why word  because if i'm the organizer i'll be terribly embarrassed in fact word called it off lah huh probably they should because they're not going to make a profit uh now for me i don't mind lah but used to used to writing papers that's why i'll have to uh the the lady who helped me with the one of my team members who helped me with the some transparencies uhm uhm it's a very uh that's that's for our own use lah that's okay but the survey uh we we extract the findings from this uh but the one who did the transparencies uh i must she brought the second paper here she must have seen the i must go back and tell her that 'a' never mind she expected to have a lot of people see her transparencies but anyway i my feeling is that any effort that that need to be put in should be put in the best way huh ya because i think this would still be useful like you say you know ya uh last year i was uh at this uh similar sybex there was a conference uhm i think what could have made a difference was that that one uh the conference itself the cidb was a problem uhm uhm uhm that's why but it seems that cidb and word are going off because of the that conference that's why you know they're having problem you see oh it seems that their division of profit was not fairly done or whatever you know i see so uhm that's why cidb not only uhm refuse to word they also refuse to send any person and give any papers no wonder 'cos they have very good contacts word  and the distribution system they just send to every developer every contractor last year the response was very good but i remembered it was cidb mainly but i say you know it should not be a problem to get a hundred people for this type of word you see shouldn't be a problem like i'll say it's basically a careless uh you know you know very careless uh approach ya i saw the advert on the exhibition uhm nothing on the conference i said well maybe they have enough people that's why now i don't know how their hong kong and the thailand they have ever heard of program symex word  but of course that's as you've noticed they're not very experienced what the the people running the show huh ya ya i received a note uh please introduce introduce yourself ya and do everything yourself your research has been mainly for government departments uh uhm so far yes but formerly you used to do some for private ya development right i do quite a bit then but recently i don't know why inunisation word is it partings of firms ya but the uh the guv the uh private side uh the investment level has gone down ya because there are so many buildings coming up you see apart from building uh private property uhm uh people are not building commercial there's just too much coming up uh ya do you see a trend uh downward movement for residential uh well we thought that and i thought that it will it'll go down it didn't go down ya it seems strong uh ya i think surprisingly i think uh what we did not expect was that the uh we had to go by supply demand plus uh the confidence factor which is related to the economic performance and uh we had to go by what the government was projecting that is that there was there will be a bit of slowdown but that slowdown didn't happen i think that is word because towards end of last year october onwards uh the market was very quiet uhm and uh we we knew that the developers were giving uh very good discounts twenty percent which means definitely there was dropping already if it carried on uh to january february it would drop you see uhm but uh what happened was the projected drop by one percent of the gnp did not happen because it was supposed to be the earlier uh expected growth rate of say five percent was revised even downwards you know uhm uhm uh but what what is apparent now the last the first three months of the year uh we might have achieved more than the original even five percent you know ya so because of that so although the market is quiet people felt uh i mean everybody is still ya is still very well-to-do right better start buying but i think this slowdown is not that it didn't happen i think this slowdown is delayed you know huh is delayed ya but the question is how long the delay word my my own feeling is that because of the sudden boost in confidence uh uhm uh people who would have uh been willing to wait uh is probably not uh sorry not going to wait too long so the level of demand would be a bit higher to pick up ya so that uh instead of stabilising and then drops slightly uh it might actually continue to keep up and then level off instead of instead of level and down it would be up and level you see the complexion is different uhm uhm uhm and uh what i did was uh the other day when the report came up uh uhm i was surprised also what i didn't i thought it would stabilise uhm but not you know uh only when the economic results came out then but what we did was to go back look at the figures again and i think that the the level of demand we may have underestimated cos' we're basing on historical figures and give a certain uh what we would expect to be a normal increase say instead of three thousand three thousand five uhm apartments uh uhm uhm and condominiums uh demanded every year we give a certain increase of maybe ten twenty percent uhm uhm to allow for income group and that will give maybe about close to four thousand as against uh expected supply of five thousand or more that obviously would be a serious over-supply but looks like the demand may we may have to revise it to say four four four five you know looking at the past three months uh ya so if you look at four five as against the supply of five thousand it's slightly above five thousand the over-supply is not not sufficient to bring price down do you think there'll be a i think uh after this report the level will even go higher uh huh that's one reason the other factor is that the the other day although uh it was not splashed uh but it was announced the cpf interest rates uh would be reduced to below three percent or below four percent is it below four currently it's four plus it'll be reduced to three point nine or something like that that has a big effect you know yes yes ya because from people's point of view why should i still leave money inside it's just not earning enough return and even if the property market should go down and later come up again never mind just put in first that's why ya i think it will have an effect they're actually encouraging more property investment i think so ya because that will be a major factor because it's miserable you're talking about three plus uh cos' three plus is like sighs  just word probably covering inflation also no growth you know consider it's a fixed deposit for twenty years uh ya it's uh it's crazy you know no growth ya 'cos any rational person if i if i have money and i have a if i can afford lah if can't afford can't be helped if i can afford and i can take out the money i will because while we talk about possible slowdown uh but uh in the longer term we know it's going up also once that uh over-supply is going to be taken up that's why but i still think that this slowdown will come lah it will it will lah it will of course the question is the effect what is the effect perhaps now it sort of smooth over you know ya word  rather than have a sharp instead of like that uh it'll just bends a little bit the other side is really quite near if you look at you can just swim across i think the idea of having this is nice but somehow as you're saying that the elements are not related at all that's why and also i think it's too harsh ya too hard too hard uh so many concrete patches ya as our environment word goal we should have sort of some landscape and a few uh fountain you know uh like that uh that's right that's right be willing to spend uh they always talk about cost cost cost the problem is that they frequently want to spend but stop short ya that's as a result of which uh we don't have hundred percent we don't have distinction we always as or bs that's a problem you know ya but uh but uh word of the other side the terminal is also very hard you know ya it is hard ya i find that i find that it's if you walk around looks nice but you you don't feel very cosy uhm ya that's right the problem is that i think we we always look at other other system australia elsewhere and try to try to sort of emulate you know uh but fail badly because we don't uh don't sort of modify to suit our own condition but in in in acoustic well it's the same thing and i think there're a lot of other things you know uhm we don't seem to have uh mature from there although i suppose this will come takes some time but right now i think uh still the the flight word  is not right but i i'm won i'm wondering uh whether this this thing will be will happen because we seem to have reached our sort of prime you know prime nation moving into an economic development you know  i think so ya i think so yes word  and we'll not we'll not the growth hub that's right and if you're not cashing in on this uh you may grow old very quickly i think so ya uhm ya a word development that's why i was and i think it's now the the other nation that can learn from our past ya and and and all that that's why yesterday sarawak this chap was telling that you know they're very keen to understand our system and see how we work because there're things that they can learn you know like conservation ya now they can look into their own conservation problem and they can plan a conservation strategy ya you know based on our lesson ya lah ya that's right right oh ya i i have been giving couple of data and uh that's why i said i have been kl kl also that's why they are very keen and ya in fact they have a lot of good buildings that's why that are not torn down unlike us we were going at a very hot pace penang also in fact uh just before this our kl office called 'can you help in this uh just giving some info lah on conservation uh how they should do it in penang you know i said no we're writing a paper for this send you a paper lah uhm ya

sentosa or something like that too commercial not really i said fraser's hill was because you know you could go up and then you can say you're feeling close to god or something fraser's hill is not that high but what about port dickson  word  port dickson is just symbolic port dickson is just uhm a port what by the sea so i don't know you can weave a favour from them uh ya today i was in the library saw this book myths and legends in of singapore published by vj times who got things like got chapters like pulau hantu haven't read it yet though is thomas interested in this sort of myths ya oh beside the middle ages more european based i think more european based ya like what sort don't know word stuff scandinavian stuff the english stuff okay uh chinese stuff he knows a bit but not singaporean stuff really oh ya 'a' uh do you know where i can get the dream of the red chamber i want to borrow is it in the library yes it is in the library i want to read it cos' my friend says it's beautiful a few a few volumes you know not only one ya he read three volumes all of them uhm uhm ya they have it in the library he told you read it he says it's very easy to read because you get in tune with the culture you see straight away really have you watched that liao tai show on tv on saturday what's that the ghost no no who acted sylvia chang that show is it no no no the liao tai series it's a series every saturday afternoon about at about four o'clock or so no i never watch at four o'clock i'm giving tui tuition oh ya ya a lot of spirits and ghosts kind of thing you watch uh no i don't unfortunately then how do you know about it i only watch the trailers oh they have these women who who take some potion to seduce men things like that and they appear with the cloth fly fly fly drug the men ya it's about time right i think we shall make a move  uh muslim laws lah which means that uhm for example uhm anyone is caught drinking word  uhm uhm he could be could be uh uh what you caned hor they're going to make it state law is it ya they're going to make it state law applicable  word to non muslims and uhm uh things like a thief or a robber would be uh amputated  word  i suppose it's alright lah if they apply i mean to but they want to they want to apply to non-muslims as well unless unless non-muslims have their own uh laws which word  they have own laws ya which are which would prescribe punishment ya but how about the present laws the present laws are not the they are not enough are not uh uhm implemented by religious groups implemented by the state ya but why must they be implemented by religious groups  word  people who are not part of the religion well that's part of the discussion now lah whether it should include muslims or non-muslims and uh word  ya but then it starts there you know very likely i mean if it succeeds there you know very likely it will ya ya national government word at first nation did say that it will not support uh such course 'cos malaysia is a multi-racial multi-religious secular state but later it uh changed its its opinion at least in the reverse and said that it would conditionally support the people as long as you apply to muslims i think that's fair i mean i mean word  muslims i mean it's fair what for for muslims to have muslim laws but word wants it to apply to ah but there are some groups that actually not not all you know like who word muslims no no not not so much word islam other uh muslim groups but ya but they are muslim groups right word  some of them will say that other people should suf i mean of course i mean of course if they word themselves they suffer most of it lah which like me uh word  so how many sherlock holmes' stories have you... no kid which one is your favourite one actually i like the one where i think it's three cables right actually it was not the crime word word three grapes three cables i thought it was three sisters that was the three cables where got three sisters the house is called three cables where old woman sits in house ya son he was her son used to be very handsome and all that and stuff uhm but he died suddenly uhm then he sent his beloved home to her a few chests and stuff and then and uhm when his mother received word uhm people started to want to buy the house and muhm was not word oh formerly it was owned by a antique it was actually the woman it was actually that woman who wanted just to retrieve something in the word  not the woman the man well the the the thing is the the actual person who wanted to retrieve anything at all was the woman whom uhm he had a bad affair with so he wrote about her in a book which was what they were after all the time  
Singapore	this weirdo approached me you know he from afar he came and then the minute he saw me he acted as if he knew me so he came forward and asked me whether i've got a change for a dollar then i said there's a machine over there why don't you try it then he he took out his money and says uhm can you change for me so i i was so shocked lah that i did it for him and gave it to gave him the money which mrt station was this dhoby ghaut oh okay uhm but then you said before right that you've been reading a lot of these weird men weirdo ya like when i was going home from school the other day this chinese man he kept turning and looking at me then he asked me whether i was working he followed me up all the way to the mrt station same mrt station uh no not not not at word  uh and then he like i walked to the right and he followed me so i walked to the left and he followed me so i went to this very big man and stood beside him so this chinese man got scared walked away ha  word another time same mrt this man oh big man he sat opposite me so when we got out you know he started he came up to me and you know what he said or not in malay lah you know malay right uh so he says uhm ya that means aiya so cute so small so i ignored him you know walked out and then he followed still you know then he said where're you going so i said working uhm why did you answer him that's why i'm very surprised you know why you like give information uh i i i mean like where are you going going home i ignored him at first then this second time i like okay lah cos he tried so hard lah embarrassing very embarrassing so i said i'm going to school ah then he said oh studying i said no i'm working where i said where very near whoa so much of information somebody didn't just walk away you know then he said aiya so cute so small i'll see you again so i i looked oh so i say no why do you say no cos he looks married and like oh so so cheeky ya but what does this these three episodes although they may be separate what does it tell you about men in general uhm a lot of weirdoes lah not all of them are weirdoes you know no but you see from these three i mean what gives them the right to just come up and pass comments on or you know intimidate you in any way you know like like i think you you should have given it to him you know when he like oh so cute so word just like just like jerlin at him or like just don't give face just walk i did not that's why i i i think so i i mean if uhm if you were to tell me of a situation i would do i would do it lah but faced with the same with with the circumstances uh i dare not you know but do you remember uhm mary as we were coming up we we were going to clementi mrt ya then there was this guy just behind us yep and so he was so close behind us you see and we were going up the escalator so like when both of us just stand and just look at him you know he said hello you know he said hello you know he said hello no you know what made me turn he said hello uh like uh i heard a voice from like out of nowhere so i turned around then he smiled so i thought like oh maybe you you knew him but then you didn't no then we just let it go word  that's how uh ya ya then what did he do then we we just turned back lah we just turned back we just i thought you knew him uh then why why why so funny strangers could say hello to strangers do you know but he was standing very close behind us you know ya ya ya it's like not not natural you know it's not like peak hour spoonerism you know he even said hello so i thought like you knew that person and he like give a smile so like stupidly i smiled you actually smiled no like i just stand i just stand back without any any question lah wasn't like like ah like that so the moral of the story stay home uh no it's not to stay home but what is the moral of the story mary the moral of the story is that we should say hello to strange men also we should initiative no no the desirable ones don't say hi to you no ya no no no no you know what you should do you know what you should do you should just shock them you know tell anyone and do what you just shock them like how maybe you say oh hello then they say you ask for it if anything happens ya because they're always bigger than us basically admitted you have to face ya that's true that's true ya so they will like if anything happens anything bad but there were two of us what two of us and only there's one of him what although he was quite he was quite tall lah but still didn't he follow you no he didn't then we can just run and shout for help i think maybe ya cos you see i uh i i was alone so i dare not do anything funny you see no but you don't have to like give him you don't have to give him face in the first place what you could just like turn around you know what i usually do i i don't even like jerlin or anything i just like just turn around like oh a blank face you know oh i didn't see you i i i see right through you and just turn so maybe the person thought i was retarded or something or person quickly thought i didn't hear you if i just you know like so you can't say that i provoke you in any way or i didn't you know that kind of thing uhm uhh and i don't like walk very fast or anything just like pretend lah or i just see through the person like that  word  but you see this is the thing you see why should women word up with this kind of thing you know why should should a man just come up and just say oh hi sexy or hi cute i mean how come  word  what gives them the right to just come up and say pass comments and invade your privacy this is this is sexual harassment you know it is you know i kana sexual harassed again you know harassed harassed brenda harassed when when when when don't want to say the other way round uh you harass the men she she just said she kana right ya so she must be object of the harassment no lah nothing i told you about the amy thing lah uh what happened it's like i i went to the repro room reprographic room you see sorry i my english very bad i rep reprograph oh that one repro i don't know how ya reprographic word  then uhm in the photographic unit lah then i was like looking we we were doing some oh oh you told me and then he had this picture he wanna put up his picture of amy ya he had this ah that is very nice picture of chinese wayang word  whose poster is that just like oh uh your uncle's uh okay then i thought oh okay then like but if it was mine i would have given it to you then i said oh ya ya i guess that's too bad and then suddenly this this guy uninvited go and come and tell me like you know who i'll put up then i'll like have to like you know humour him that who would you put up amy yip and then like effect lost on me but he was like grinning away then i like ya okay do you know who's amy yip then i was like uh  word dozen right ya hong kong actress i was like trying to feign ignorance uh uh uh uh and then like oh okay ya smile even more but do you know what she does i said she acts and like she does more than that i thought so oh oh ya this is sexual harassment man she acts in ra movies still acts what acts what acts what still acts right okay acts what what happens if word she acts what then then then the other librarian the other librarian like aiyah chen uh you don't uh what don't don't say this kind of things uh don't talk about ra movies lah you want to talk about ra movies everyday you go to the toilet you can see one ra movie yourself i feel like kana sexual harassed twice from two men at one shot right sick or not what do you say from now onwards don't talk dirty jokes in front of me i don't want to hear don't talk sorry ya no respect ya lor that's why but that's it you see where do you draw the line you know from allowing someone to just pass a comment you know about you and where you know if it's kind of ya like uh i say some some sometimes some women like uh they like it you know they feel even flattered oh you know at least this person that bothers to look at you and say oh hi sexy something uh but i think i don't know generally my my feeling is that i i'm not flattered uhm and i just i just don't like it uhm i mean you just don't like strangers coming into i i get flustered with word whistle yes very disgusted and you find that it is men who do this you feel embarrassed you know ya of course men who do this so why can't the women do this you see women have more class you see they don't do this sort of things you know you you you talk like a psychiatrist you know no lah but it's you see i suppose if if women did it then if anything untoward happens then they always say you ask for it you uh ask for it did you watch did you watch uhm word not accused uhm uhm what's that two women they were acting that uh salmon lewis salmon lewis oh ya ya i like i i i love her i love her i love her i love word you know i love her i like both of them no i love her more uh uh who's that? ya but i don't know it's like you see let's say if you see like if just because like she she was having fun with this guy just dancing like that uh so if he want to go a step further like you know like it's as if she asked for it you know that kind of thing yeah it's just like why why is it that women can have no men can have fun anyway they want but women cannot have fun it's oh you ask for it kind of thing you know ya  it's ridiculous you know it's ridiculous uhm so how's your school my school lah okay lah very busy because exams oh finished already uh ya just yesterday i thought you were supposed to key in your grades this tuesday right that's why word  the other teachers are not as efficient as me so they have not done their work yet uhm oh so they have not passed you the grades lah ya you know sin sin i got this stupid girl lah oh sin uh ya ya so her marks uh she's an all-rounder so she gets twenty odd for all her subjects how sorry teacher's joke okay ya like twenty two twenty eight oh okay so i told her actually your marks uh would be nice if it uh if it's my waist um but but for exam marks no so maybe she'll stay home and have babies

it maybe uh oh because uh  word david david is going to david says he will stop at the mrt station ya but i am sure oh but he ya uh he asked you to give jenson a call right ya jenson word   word we should have a dial uh question  word  seriously you consider about the the dl word  uh okay lah  word can record it uh uh no you have to go through the training phase first you know what what training phase there must be training what they teach you how to do it for you probably not much uh uhm but they will teach you how to do it how long is the training phase no it is it is continuous what oh you mean i i start in august ya we are leading on tuesday uh okay yes sir word  so like like i was saying they came to conduct the sessions uh who we meet every tuesday uh uhm so we can you will join us for every tuesday uh uh and then uh probably for a for two or three sessions uh  word time you are comfortable and then you will lead the class or co-lead together with somebody else's uh so in this case you are probably co- lead with me first but i thought you are at at uh stl oh ya then then you probably do it together with sin tiong uh uh but sin tiong will be promoted to dl he is he is always been with dl you know oh is it ya it is just that oh it is just that that he is too busy to or there are too many no because there are there are word too many he so he co- he co- he co-teach together with me so if i can't uh he i can't do it on those days then he will do it lah so he should be finished his exams soon right june uh june uh ya hopefully he passed i hope hopefully he passed i hope word  probably would lah if he passed then we will we celebrate with him if not we will moan with him uh ah don't forget me don't worry uh i will i will cut for you august uh august august twentieth we will be starting again okay so uh if you want then you probably can join us in august uh that will give me a lot of time to think about it the communal-wise not too bad now right uh you are confused word  uh all right huh i am i may not want to go to ministry of labour for my attachment uh why not don't know whether got time maybe later next year lah why got no time you still got a lot of time got lah got lah if you don't do it now you won't do it later you know i know and i still find it very useful because the only person that still still maintains that contact uh uhm  word uh is only is only me uh me and tze peng that kind of uh uh uh but tze peng one is still quite far tze peng only contacts within word for two days you see i thought i will go before september because i want to  word  i want to attend the stats course one more time  word  ya i want to go after that huh but it must be a  word not more than three months you know huh ya but it must be a four month kind of a attachment otherwise ah yes otherwise you won't get to know the whole mechanics you know ya i but he they when i talked to jerry and the they didn't they didn't sound very keen uh maybe i talk to him again no actually they say okay you know it is good you know but they they cautioned me in that i should not uh look at the administrative side of it so much true ah true ah ya but it is not the administrative ya more for uh my own experience uh ah it is actually for the work experience exposure how you go about investigating a case uhm ya it is word that you can actually see a the whole area of factory ya which you will never get to see here moving out sub-factories word so it's actually very very narrow uh the only ones that you see actually word on and off you get to see a few electronics factories and that is about it uhm unless i go myself lah no you can't go word you see ya difficult lah no you can't you can't just word you can't just word into the factory uh ya ya quite difficult lah so i think i was thinking of starting in september october and november probably actually you may want to speak to hock siang and find out what is the best time to go uh ya he he because they have their peak periods and and down period ya uh the peak period meaning a lot of staff going on leave that kind of thing uhm get a chance to do more you see uhm because if you are there and everybody is there uh then you you won't have much you won't have much to do uh actually i have a word i i can take over what is his name uh that guy peter tay ah peter tay while he is doing his full-time course uh ah ya he is starting what he is starting from july ya word  so june the whole month the whole practically the whole year oh uhm they will love your your presence to a certain extent so what do they do there quite busy uh no lah not too too bad but you can investigate some of the case actually will be good they probably will not allow you to investigate the whole case uh but you can tag along you see you can even go with hock siang or go with people like siok lin who won't mind showing you the ropes uh that is the thing you see if i go uh for because i talked to hock siang he said it will take me at least one or two months right to be familiar to be able to be on my own uh that is what that is how long peter tay took ya two three months right but but you won't say i won't be useful to them that is the problem right uh certainly you won't be that useful lah but one one of the thing that you can offer them is that you can try to help them out to upgrade their computer system aiyah word  and you are using d base they use d base you are quite familiar right whoa i'm very familiar with d base uh least familiar very very familiar ah that is that is very good what because uh the only one that is helping them out now is this uh fifty something year old man who is retiring soon huh really ya okay lah i don't mind i you cos i am qualified because when i asked last spoke to hock siang in uh word  he said six months will be nice lah because six months will be a real help to them rather than uh uhm uhm might be just a burden to them no but you won't be a burden uh if you if you just tag along you see ya lah in all their visits that kind of thing ya true lah uh then at the during the times when you are free if you can help them out on the computer system  uhm uhm that side of the people will appreciate that because uh prior to this this guy uh chee lan uh somebody else did it for them i mean this engineer you know and he spent most of this time just doing all these thing and then he got so word he went he quit you know he quit the job and went to do a diploma in the in artificial intelligence is it ya oh iiss oh ya graduated and they have enough they have enough systems around what oh you might like to try cos the other thing i have to plan my dissertation i don't want to don't want to schedule my dissertation before march next year ya january lah 
Singapore	you've got a minute sure oh what do you want to talk about oh that's i just was wondering whether we could discuss our projects so we know what we are all doing okay why don't you go ahead first uhm i am trying to figure out something to do for my dissertation i thought you already had your health promotion project in mind ya ya but i need to find out what exactly i want to do with it what about the uh the company that had approached you  word  is it word  no the one that uh i was working with kai hong and the big one that uh the boss was involved in is it that one that students lead the project uh no uhm the one you said was your going to be your main focus for the next year oh that's a johnson and johnson company ah uh i don't know but that one is still tentative can't wait that long what are they going to do they want to start this healthy lifestyle thing which they've got bought word it from johnson and johnson and uh might be a bit difficult to get in uh too big and then they're starting off uh it seems to be a lot of strings attached so it may not be such a good idea at this point in time may not be able to get it ready by my dissertation time so thinking of natsteel natsteel is good because the management is very supportive but there's a problem what's their that problem natsteel is not a typical uh typical company i mean it's it's a very heavy industry it's only iron and steel mill we have and then the turnover is shockingly low it's about how much less than four percent but that's good no that's bad because i can't extrapolate you see uh on the one hand it's good for my for my project study uhm it's bad because at the end of it i can't really i can't really extrapolate and say this is what other companies would have unless you first say that it should uh have a better turnover and then the population are older because they don't they don't resign so it's an older population whoa the average age is about forty years old then companies like at & t is about twentish and then turnover is about thirty-five percent there and these are the majority that's your typical company then if i take one like that and i have a high turnover i can't do anything either problem well but are there a group of companies with a low turnover like natsteel as far as i know very few and and an older population so it's it's the exception uh that that seems to be seems to be finance steel is is a very good place to do a control study they've got the structure for it i think i just going ahead i mean it's for your dissertation ya unless i finish it uh you can just before july ya and then later on if you want to do a bigger one that you can extrapolate you can do it after the course correct sounds good what about yourself well i've got all the data uh and i've done most of the sub word about half the analysis and i've word up the literature review then i am going to do the results but i've to do it i hope to get the first draft out by july because i understand that once the course starts there's very little time to do the dissertation i pity the the people who come with no data and have to actually go and start doing their survey from scratch because they really have to struggle what with studying and doing the project at the same time i think there're very few of these they seem to know those who come most of them come with their word  ya most of them do unless it's a one-year thing so at the end of it you've got three months no it's nine months for me it's nine it's still nine months this year uh ya oh from next year it's one year oh you can always wait but it doesn't matter because the last three months are only for your dissertation optional ya ya uhm yours is cervical cervical cancer screening screening screening pep smear what do you find anyway i found that fifty-four point four percent of women in pasir panjang grc have had a pep smear how frequently in their lives have ever had a pep smear fifty four point four percent and of this about never mind oh dear i've to lift this thing uh see how many have had it eighty-one point five percent had it within the last three years eight one point five percent of the fifty four of the fifty four that's not very good uh ya it's not great but you see the the point i am going to make in this dissertation is it doesn't the utilization rate is not the main thing you see it's catching the high risk groups and screening them and the high risk groups are the groups that are not being screened at present which are which are the older you know the people women who are high risk for cervical cancer the older women lower socio-economic status and uh the indians okay pasir panjang there isn't a a word women clinic serving now clementi pasir panjang means clementi ayer rajah and pasir panjang uh okay and west coast ya oops ya well anyway it was quite interesting but now that i am oh dear what has happened now that i am doing the analysis i found there are a lot of flaws uh oh i've been putting things on it and it's hung switch it off you got it on back-up uh uh you got you got it saved right ya i wasn't end the program ya uhm okay let's move on are you doing anything else apart from that i heard something like what uhm what mac micro molecular molecular word  molecular epidemiology that's right so count how many molecules there are in epidemiology  word present in that area community are you going yep that's a fact for the talk later on uh no i am going tomorrow  word there's something tomorrow is it it's the same per by the same person but uh it's a different function tomorrow it's word tomorrow is organized by the cancer society for children and schools and things like that you know uhm and but today is a sep professional lecture  word mckay word is it or mer something rather mekay word  mekay word  j two okay lah aiyah don't know how about this fantasy fantasy cruise cruise thing are you going i won't be in singapore i will be away holiday no it's the course in word  mid-june on uhm molecular epidemiology no it's not it's on cancer pathology okay molecular epidemiology is a long-term kind of plan if i still have to get the basics sorted out oh so you haven't started on it i haven't got any like any project you know uh uh i could have epidemiology but i am trying to get a feel of lab work you know you've to do lab work kill mice and that sort of thing well it's up to me i supposed whether ultimately i  word want to do the killing and the word and all that kind of thing you see what sort of work is it it's well it's molecular epidemiology is using bio marker biological markers in epidemiology you see okay you know applying epidemiology sounds like a lot of lab work ya blood tissue and things like that but you have a choice you see you can either be an epidemiologist who collaborates with lab people to help them in projects so you do collaborative work or you can actually go into lab work and do things like what choon hang and chen yang and all that are doing but we have an epidemiology background so you do molecular epidemiology i thought chen yang is here to do computer stuff no he's not he's doing uh work on liver oh is that right  word ya word toxins but he's in the who computer collaborating centre thing that's not chen yang that's the other guy there uh the chap who lives who doesn't works in the computer lab he look a bit like chen yang uh that's not chen yang chen yang is the one who works in that lab chen yang is the word  he's not from china is it i think he was born in china but he's studied in the states oh that's chen yang the one that comes in for tea yes and all that and this chappy is not is not he's i don't know who he is i think he's direct from china maybe because he doesn't speak so much english oh and all along i thought chen yang so what's chen yang's position here he's a research scientist he's got phd and everything whoa oh he has right he's doctor right i don't know i think he is yes i always thought the other guy is chen yang i even called him chen yang oh he didn't correct you chen yang has uh uh has bought himself a powerboat so i went up to ho ho and thought was chen yang i said uh you bought a powerboat with this ah uh good morning that was a very good interval word  really chen yang has bought himself a powerboat ya power book book the map oh i thought a powerboat the sort that you ride on on the sea ya dear me dear me in fact yours had a great word  the tall power of no no no no that that people thing you know that one we clip on your word  no it's ching yee's must go and get one of these uhm you're still going home at lunch it's quite tiring ah i find quite tiring for us too spending lunch swimming oh dear we went today it was raining but we decided that we want a feel of getting wet what about lightning then we got up don't believe this uhm so what else are you going to do apart from your a lot of things to tie up i've got that then i've got uhm a smoking sensation/cessation word  aids paper which i've done already first draft smoking sensation/cessation word aids you know all the nicotine oh re replacement therapy uh uh uh but it's not good enough i i want to pull out more articles and tighten up what is that for probably word  uh prof suggested that i do it it's a review uh it's a review article then but we don't really use it in singapore haven't seen anybody word using it oh ya but word so it'll be useful the other one is uhm a study on acupuncture on smoking sensation/cessation word which uh is it martin martin did the army one uh we've got the one that was done by safra which and i i've got the figures with me for quite long already but this was posted out i didn't have a chance to work on it so i want to work on that then there's a chapter on health promotion for prof jerry's book that one i have to collate so i have to prioritise lah i think i do the chapter first because it's a what july deadline uh uh then i've got to do uhm i have got to go through my draft again for this john's article got more articles than i am comfortable with so i am not taking anything more until i clear up they all telling me i must learn to say no you see keep passing things on me oh no  it's difficult to say no uh yes in in our position but have to say wait lah uhm everyone outside keeps thinking that i am always interested in all their sort of work as long as there are statistics involved got one that wanted me to collaborate with him on word  cancer wants me to go into the cancer pull out all the cases uh that's  word cancer and and relate it to hormonal level in this hospital ya ya ya he'll you mean he wants you to do the pulling out ah yes yes yes wow good you said no ya i said no ya lor there's a lot of work you know so i think enough you know to to for the next six months at least the second six months i will be tying up my data i want the graph to come through no graph no graph can't really start on it what are you going to propose propose with this one this health promotion ya ya by natsteel natsteel 
Singapore	that's why she's a gospel singer she's got that and she sold her look you know i like uhm ya and she's so gorgeous ya young and then these these women would be checking her up talking to her finding out about her women i think just casual conversation you see cos she's so young and they were so amazed after she left then you know i just met this girl who was going to school you know all by herself and there was this little girl on the greyhound too and she cried all the way she cried the first part of the way she's crying like mad because her mum put her on the bus to go with her father report her oh shit poor girl how old is she eight maybe nine trauma ya she i don't know i was taking the bus greyhound from uh chicago to indiana oh what happened was i missed the the word  was so funny cos i took about i thought it would just take an hour for me to get from where i was in chicago down downtown you see to the bus station little did i know when i went it was rush hour oh god i and the bus journey was like hell so by the time i got there i got to the tracks i was like where's the train and then there was a station master there and i said uhm where is the train that's bound for indiana uhm maam you see those tail lights over there you're right that's the one uh oh shit so word greyhound and uhm this was during the time when the uhm the floods had just been over and everyone was talking about it so i was seated right at the back and there were a couple of black guys and initially it was very i was like uh then then after all they started talking uhm you know uh what what is that they said uhm ya that's it had i been in chicago earlier this uhm earlier this week i mean i would have gone downtown and caught me a carp you you know what happened to the floods you hear about the floods don't know ya ya they've they flooded the building oh the entire basement see what happened was uhm these jokers while building the subway had driven a wall right down through uhm was it the city's foundations i don't know anyway while they were building something they had driven a wall right down through a subway see a really old wall and that has lasted for about a decade until now because of the i think the river was coming upstream or something and then it just word the dam and all the basement stuff all i mean everything you know from word  to the area everything was downtown chicago right all the basements were flooded millions and millions of bucks and it's like chicago isn't exactly a rich city either and uhm plus the riots and everything it just made things a lot worse so ya ya it was just great because there was an oriental family with us and uhm you'll be amazed to find there are a lot of blacks in america still think that there's a lot of i don't know it's just amazing the amount of prejudice they have against the whites and the whites against them imaginary and real and and as when i told this friend that i made it to indiana about what had happened on the bus he asked me how many orientals were there and i said aside from me there were about five of us really at two am in the morning and i said ya and you know what was even more surprising there was this black guy who offered to help the uhm well he was seated at the back and so one of the kids fell asleep you see the mum wanted to move him up he just picked up the kid and put him down you know it's like and he helped me put my bag up and everything and and so he said you know things are really changing now i said oh really uhm it it's just it's like the kind of stuff you read in books only thing that it's becoming real you know you see it there uhm oh of course you're reading books from them ya i know ya and and when i was in chicago i went to universities a lot there was a students' discussion i took part in but actually it was more an informal thing was at jimmy's the students' bar i went there i was the only oriental there the entire group ostracized me okay tsk habis man oh my god really uhm they didn't even speak to me they looked at me of course and then word me back with uhm you know that kind of thing and i was like okay i'll just sit and i'll listen to what you're saying oh really after a while nobody was talking to me anymore in fact nobody began to there was some newcomer with me as well but she was uhm she looked more like them oh so after a while i just got up and i said to my friend look i think i want to leave now and he was white then i went up i said what the hell was going on back there uhm uh and for the next hour and a half there was a white-bashing session oh uhm uhm they're sick yeah and i was really amazed these were masters students very talented brilliant people who have travelled a lot very widely oh they must be from oh obviously they are not brilliant enough they must be from no they must be from the upper classes probably upper middles lah anyway yeah brought up in a kind of environment which is only white you know but you'd be finding the prejudice coming from the lower classes as well they come from all classes then even upper upper middle people they can be very nice people uhm i mean they had a lot of comments about my english and oh you speak very good english oh they are always amazed but then i guess someone told me i i felt it was quite patronizing yes it was but then someone told me wouldn't you react the same way if you see a white speaking chinese ya that's true and i thought ya but it's just very funny when they speak to you slowly oh ya and they have a look in the eye like saying are you getting what i'm saying are you getting what i'm saying it's very funny oh ya i had an experience here in singapore it's about there's this australian chap first time in the orient i hate the word orient it's like something you described word first right ya uh that's right like victorian times they call this place suh ya really ancient you know like we're totally it's like it's like it's like we're still wearing manchu clothes and wearing trees word  you know when i called the operator one which state in singapore number two okay do they speak english back there i mean it was like ah god it's amazing how uhm we know so much about them and how little they know about us you see ya it's cultural domination you know and they think it's not important because we're just one little island back in the east they don't even know we're an island they don't know they don't even know not many people down there over there uh know what singapore where singapore is oh ya i know every time i say where singapore is i usually appendage it with one degree from the equator not in china miles from it and and then i confuse them with the straits chinese description uhm and and i had these people it's really quite amazing and and and it's like but the poor people at night word  i mean some of them i was called the fucking hit in uhm in those island what ya i guess it's all part of the la island experience i got up the boat i was on my way down and that this carrot-coloured punk uh uhm uh uh just started muttering hey hey fucking hit fascist racist you know ya man probably got style on his cheek but that was the only experience i had with racism that's why from the harvard experience which you probably know of did i tell you about that ya what the harvard experience who was that in boston i didn't tell you about that it was probably vivienne i told then it was really quite bizarre i want to take a picture of the reading room and compare it with the situation here uh uhm then and apparently oh ya ya i've taken a picture of this old man who was sitting there and studying you should have asked permission uh well actually i didn't intend to take a picture of him oh he was just part of the background foreground actually so what happened was uh five minutes later he charged down the stairways and grabbed the camera just out of my hand like that i was just talking to my friend i was holding the camera he just pulled it out and all that what the hell and he then he started to fiddle with it and everything my god he's sick he didn't even explain or anything and i said we shouldn't have taken a picture we shouldn't have taken a picture and i was thinking of uhm t s elliot's word woman and he was like he started fiddling but it was a manual thing so he couldn't fiddle anything with it so friends of mine were there and they grabbed hold of him and then a tussle followed then the police were brought in and then then you know removed the rascal and oh god hey boy was it management came and then are you okay were you alright and then uhm of course as his parting shot uhm he looked at all four us two south africans one dutch and one oriental he said get the hell back wherever you came from and if you published any of that i'll i'll make sure you're sorry for it or something yeah but it was great i mean he was he was kind of a good-looking man too i mean it's like you know he's very well-trimmed white beard and wearing beige-coloured shirt bizarre now how am i going to incorporate all of that into a story you try you try ya smart girl like you yes uh uh do i detect words word of condescend don't disappoint us naw naw lah well should i be i believe in letting people have the freedom to do to write what they want to write oh yeah ya so i i try not to circumscribe lah otherwise it'll be too much i'm going to write something too don't know how to write as i know so much i think everybody word too much ya if you know too much about something it's very difficult to focus or you can write about racism uhm ya ya you can write about racism i've got a couple of newspapers with uhm those journalists chinese journalist who's working at san fran uh uhm in san francisco or something and uh she was writing about the la riots her experiences with word  uh uhm what you say is true you know there's this black woman who said word down  word everywhere no matter how high you climb there's always going to be one above you uhm  word  maybe there's why so many people come back here ya  that's one of the advantages i love the openness uh uhm you come back here the atmosphere everything is so stifling in a way uh uhm but then again it could be imaginary ya it's different also i mean it's like i think it depends on who you hang out with also it depends on who you you talk you meet the kind of people here i mean uhm i'm quite happy here that's good that's good i am happy here if i have my way but then i haven't been away a lot you see for people who did like studying in england i have friends who have to come back from england they're not happy here because all their formative years were there uh you know poor thing in the university and then they come back and you know  word  and they're rotting away here uhm i always told myself that these things were imaginary and i and i've been abroad i find myself defending my own country and when i came back here it's like came back to hey this place is stifling and boring and ai the same vicious circle the grass is always greener but then there are a lot of things here anyway i believe that really things that are closed up you see closed up it's ugly you see you think it's beautiful you see from afar but when you look at it closed up it looks quite ugly then you have to word get beyond that point and look at look at it closed up you find the beauty you see but it's the same whether you're here whether you're there it's the same thing perceptions don't change it's word attitude doesn't change but there are things here that keep on surprising me all the time there's always something that's word all the time so i like that's why i'm quite happy but there are people here who are i mean it's not a complete desert you see there are people here who are worth it you know ya there are but it's i don't know maybe it's because i've always been too insular and i don't really have that many friends around me usually i tend to mix around stagnate in the same pool uhm no you don't stagnate okay to use alvin's term you get deeper you get deeper you don't stagnate okay must must have description also yes okay you go down deeper then you surface again and then you can like take a view you know and you have a take a ah  word  ya it's a it's a spiral movement ya you go down again you surface again uhm and you look around you

Singapore	where are you all taking the cab to uh home paya lebar mrt uh home uh oh why not home she's yio chu kang you know ya that's why different area i'm queenstown i think the best place is mrt oh is it you're going to take mrt is it i i was thinking of that ya okay lah or alternatively we can take sixty two if we can't get a cab later oh there's one  word   word  it's along river valley i see it's very nicely arranged uhm uhm everything you you you you should see the instruction booklet that choong keong issued to the helpers ah ya every page is the instructions very meticulous ya word instructions uh ya given to all uh each specific job role ya then can i take a look at that tomorrow ah i didn't bring uh but anyway mee lan told me when i talked to her a couple of days ago or mon monday holiday ya she told me she said oh last sunday choong keong just is just issued an amended instruction booklet word  wow it's still a booklet you know i saw it this morning it's in a smaller form but it's still thick amended instruction some more ya i mean it's so thick uh you probably can't tell where the amendments are made unless you highlight it all maybe if you could just issue the amended pages you know because i mean i'm only interested in the work i'm doing waste of i mean he's a perfectionist lah is he ah don't know there from there i gathered that he he's very meticulous he did all these all those things by himself uhm ya lily didn't even know word  uh ya until we went to their new house you see to to for the meeting then lily was started started telling us because we're asking her what we should do then she started telling us and then the next thing we knew  word uh uh he choong keong started distributing all those where are you now brenda still in nus yes oh uhm how long will that be uh you mean the entire project ya it will take a number of years serious serious so you will be with it not necessarily oh ya the project itself will word  last for so long uhm but you don't have to be with it you're not bonded to committed no no no it's a one-year contract oh subject to renewal is that i see ya have you started looking for other jobs me i got an offer but i'm not very keen even before he gave me a firm offer i was really feeling quite uneasy about the job already why because when i was quite happy after the first interview but when they offered me i mean just unofficially they asked me to go down for meeting to discuss the my my no my period of notice and other terms i found out that they don't even have a hrd uh i see human resource department ya a lot of things are not properly done so i'm quite hesitant lah started be care feeling hesitant about it and you know to so i i i i want to put it nicely when they offered me the job at a certain price i quoted i i asked for something much higher uhm like much higher means uh it's about six more than five thousand dollars higher i see ya so i was thinking maybe they'll turn me down immediately you see but they say they'll think about it then yesterday they call me and tell me they will give me so i said oh oh but the problem was we did we you see they talk so much you know so much so that when i wanted to ask them certain things uh i didn't have a chance and then i forgot uhm ya so you know things like how many months' notice i must give how many days' annual leave are you giving me and things like that it was not mentioned at all until they called me yesterday i have to give three months' notice i have to i've only get i i'll only be getting fourteen days' annual leave oh which is the same as here that's what i was telling him about you see uhm i'm hoping that i'll get something more unless it's a five-day week then fourteen days is okay you see ya then he said oh he qualified lah he said they will be looking into that uh in the following in the next one year because they are thinking of coming up with some company policy but the that's not a promise you see uhm so i was very hesitant so i told him i need to think think about it then he was quite surprised because it so happened that yesterday morning i received a call from another application another letter company that i wrote to and they asked me to go down for interview on monday so initially i i saw like i was i was not sure whether i wanted to oops oh dear so i just took a number i told them i'll call them if i want to go down for interview then after i spoke to this guy uh i decided to try another job oh so i'll be going for interview on monday i didn't really feel very peaceful about it lah so i don't want but i didn't tell him no straightaway i told him i'll think about it then i told him actually i'm considering other offers my main concern is if my present employer can promote me this july i'll stay i'm waiting for a word from them only oh i've already spoken to them so i'm waiting for them do we alight you mean here uh not here right can we alight how come they don't have a you know taxi stand or something taxi ya lor  word so hot perspiring you know ya then this jo said wei tze your whole back is wet i said i'm not immune to this weather word ya ya you may stay here for one hundred years and you cannot be immune to it and still be subject to all the heat and all that jo is very funny she was late so she couldn't go to lily's house to meet us uhm so she called up to say that she'll meet us at the botanic gardens uhm and when we went there we were late so she was furious she say she took the cab to one entrance and she waited and waited she says she'll be there before eight uhm we got there at eight-thirty you see and then she walked from that entrance to that entrance it so happened that when she got when she got to the other entrance we just arrived we just passed by so we saw her we stopped the car picked her up she was so furious she went into the car she made so much noise the whole car was so noisy ya and then that driver was so cute the driver is very chatty you see she kept asking her uh jo uh i'm uh don't know i can't remember how he introduced himself by another curt way you see then after that jo ignored him you know she continued making noise ya and then he asked her are you cold cool already have you all got cards ya i got card do you have more than one handbag me ya the last time i saw you you were carrying last time when oh the bus lah because i saw you twice on the bus you see when you told me you were going to cook that was how many that was two years ago wei tze ya now that you mentioned i realize it's two years ago you mean you noticed my bag no you see when i saw you i wanted to see you how much you've changed you see uh so naturally i'll notice uhm i include the handbag too from top to toe right no i didn't notice your shoes last sunday was my company's twenty-fifth anniversary uhm they had a family day you see uhm so we had some kind of carnival going it was organized by victor khoo and company so we had all those uh games water games and all sorts of stage games ya they gave us some uh door gifts you know include the towel and some cleanser thing i kept the whole thing in the cupboard i don't know whether if i remember next time i remember the cleanser i take it out whether it'll still be okay i didn't want to take out because if i take it out the thing will it will lost the shape you see word : it's nice the towel was very nice it has got such things you know and they actually managed to print it in the same logo uh with the the word and the heart there right ah ya uhm i think so i think it's not easy you know it's probably through contact lah probably they have contacts uhm get it at cost price 'cos this lee peng asked them how much it cost then jo said how can you ask that kind of thing then lily said oh i got it at cost price it's quite crowded here word  but it's so far this is much more lighter ah word yes are you okay you cough when you word you start coughing when you're in an air-con place uhm so how about this place can't be helped too oh dear it's a long distance you get ticklish is it uhm next time must bring a tumbler of water fishermen ya fisherman that's what i use it for you know uhm i get i get this problem every now and then oh really ya so actually i don't like to eat it because like just now before when the reception start started uh uhm i was coughing word i said oh  word because i need to help them so i just pop one into my mouth the moment i popped in within one minute i started sneezing it's too strong but what kind of positions are all your offers about oh my the one that offer that i want word  was uhm an accountant's word but it's head of accounts department uhm the department has got about six seven seven or eight staff lah uhm the job will be finance and admin then this one that i'm going to is finance and admin manager uhm but i felt it's a small company have you heard of this company called pan pacific publish publication ya of course uh of course why  word  ya ya but what do you all know about that i'm going there for the interview i don't know just know it as a publisher ya i i heard of it as a publication company but i don't know much ah but i'll go and see uh actually what is the main reason for you to oh the main reason is my boss lah ya because last time i was quite comfortable you see whatever job she gave me even things that you know she was too busy to do i mean she didn't want to do she just gave it to me taxation the whole group's taxation word you see it's now by the taxation bank just check feedback in instruction to carry on uh i did word reports at the time i word my my boss already did not give me a lot of work that without inform me about the kind of work she is doing there the work that she should coach me while word   right from the beginning i was word  assisting meaning when whenever she's not around i have to do what she is doing but she's never prepared me she's never informed me or never done anything to inform me of what she's doing and ya so i i mean i was quite happy because i was very busy i didn't want to take on whatever lah then when we put in the word report in last year i was quite busy so i said i i believe at that time i started having  word because of word  but it i was word because i was doing the release doing petrol data i was quite unhappy about it lah but i took it as a chance for me to uhm to get hands-on experience of the system lah so that it'll give me it'll help me to supervise the staff you see uhm more effectively and then she went on maternity leave before she went i was so worried you know because i knew that a lot of work she did i'll never i'll never be able to handle uhm just worried that there'll be a lot of word  to do she just went off one week before she went off she started telling me about what report that she gave but that was word what you have been doing for the whole year you know so she went off suddenly because her word  burst you see oh then had to open her drawers everyday look through all her things she's very messy you see her things and find out what's going on there are certain things that she filed very nice very systematically so she word  ya but it was terrible i had a very hard time i worked so late and then and then then she after that just before she went she mentioned a couple of times oh by the time i come back they probably don't need me any more you can easily do my job that to me i took it very naturally lah that no word  i mean i don't feel i'll be able to do as good a job as you 
Singapore	okay i'm ready ya i'm ready too ready go oh come on don't be so unsporting is it ready uh ya it's functioning and without the okay so what do you want to talk about uh it's got slight interference not too bad i think but i guess can't choose you know it's an old mike might sound like me i think so okay what do i sound like cute really ya right i didn't think is talk about something more substantive than this okay okay uh other case so what do you think of the case which i told you just now which case could you brief me about it all over again no way oh god please no way no okay what about your arbitration case maybe you can tell me about that or is that so hush hush that it's so hush hush that no one outside of the whole of  word knows about it and that's about three hundred people ya sure uhm so how uhm some other case wouldn't okay well well uhm we're going for a raid this wednesday sh cartoon how can you tell people that a raid a raid you know a raid as in  word  no we're going for a search warrant you know arrest search warrant of a warrant of arrest no no no what am i saying warrant of arrest is hawaii five-o no you can go for a warrant of arrest if if a person defaults in appearance ya right uh warrant to search and seize warrant to search and seize that's right that's what we're doing on wednesday oh uh really there are some counter features of our clients' fabric design kind of difficult right on what basis copyright uh copyright infringement ya i mean i've seen the two design uh the colours are very similar but the designs i see uh not exactly alike word  substantially alike so word  i mean one look from far uh looks like the same material but when you examine it closely and you're looking for differences you can find if you're not if you're not one cursory glance if you're really observant won't make a difference still then you you will be able to you even if you are 'cause if even if you're very observant cursory glance you may not find it really ya but you have to look for the difference okay probably you can but it but it happened to my client once you know where they called me up and started screaming saying that one of the departmental stores were actually selling uh the fabric uh uh uh uh that was similar to theirs and the reason why they were so uptight was because uh it was their summer collection it was they were going to launch it and was already found in another departmental store uh so you know they actually went to buy up actually went to buy up every they actually went to i mean they went to that departmental store and bought up the stocks and then of course subsequently they spoke to the 'cause they were going to launch that design so it would really spoil the market apparently and but i compared the thing i couldn't tell the difference i brought it home you know and my mother could tell the difference she said texture-wise is different style print why didn't you go for your warrant of seizure and or search and and no the problem is that look uhm this one may not even beat the counterfeit because the fabric may come from the same source so it's there is no copyright infringement right it is the same garment same quality it's a breach of contract so it's a breach of contract which doesn't warrant a seizure you see uh uh no no hey am i word  you mean there are flats above saint michael's yeah it's a nice little flat two bedrooms you mean saint michael's in holland village yeah oh i didn't even know there are two-storey flats there are flats up there and the the entrance is at the back of saint michael's so that's where sweet secrets and stuff like that above there right but this flat is nearer the road uhm next to goh seng huat oh you meant the electrical shop uhm ah okay so the entrance to the flat is uhm at that back of the bank tat lee bank or whatever bank how big is the flat how many bedrooms and two bedrooms uhm good size sitting room i didn't see the kitchen it's a nice little cozy flat what made her moved out of her flat because she she can't uhm live in university property she's joined ie oh i see and ie doesn't provide housing allowance there's housing allowance oh but you'll have to search for your own flats don't they have some quarters uhm like near ngee ann  word  i think so they're for visiting visiting professors or people on exchange or in college green what about college green those are still university housing so after that when we went to to eat at chinese shop opposite saint michael's so that's when you met chandran and suresh they were coming to join us oh i i thought they had been jogging oh father and son jogging i see they don't go jogging together do they go jogging separately yes chandran doesn't go so often and suresh tries to go once or twice a week  word  now he's got flab around his stomach that won't go away you know so how was the food anyway in this friend's shop chinese food not bad you know that joint which shop is it it's not the uhm hawker centre opposite the uh corner coffee shop opposite saint michael's do you remember is it a restaurant it is a restaurant and they have satay they have satay recently that man i saw  word  it's quite good is it the satay is good really but no one talked to me about this stall unless it's by is it by a malay his satay is malay oh i see he was there before and he used to sell satay on outside the shop and he got chased away a number of times it seems like illegal so he went away then after a while he'll come back and try again the health authority to come down upon him then he would go away again so now he's got his own stall but this time there is there used to be a stall in the shop selling popiah it seems the rent went up to three thousand for the stall so that man moved away the satay seller has taken over so he can afford the rent three thousand three thousand expensive just for a stall yeah not even like a shophouse or something more there's a there's a new banana leaf uh restaurant chellah yeah where it's uhm next to the times bookshop oh also in holland village also in holland village okay have you been there uhm i've been to take away like word  first time we went it's okay but it's very south indian it's not what you know north indian type it's more south indian dhall and it's more like the race course road that's right apollo and muthu's and all that they have fish head which i see it's uh and they have  word  but then it's air-con you know i can't imagine sitting in with air-con eating my word body will word of uh in apollo you've done you've done doesn't but i am intrigued by this uhm malay man who started up a chinese restaurant malay man chinese where didn't you see that i mean that uh this person who uh sell satay oh but he's always been there but he he's he doesn't run the whole restaurant i notice he only serves oh okay he only serves satay and he uses disposable bowls and plates but he doesn't have to do any washing what and also word  depends on how depends on how fussy you are if it's there's muslim food it's muslim food lah where i'm concerned are you quite strict about that i know antonia might say i suppose i am i suppose if there's a choice between muslim and a non-muslim i wouldn't go for a muslim but uh in singapore it's quite difficult to prevent aye how do you make dosai i haven't made dosai for so long in fact i made a mistake once i was coming from kl i threw away some of my pots and pans and those were the best ones you know they were the seasoned one you know but they looked so ugly i throw them away and in fact even i miss them because they were seasoned and aluminium ya the old type people say aluminium is to be avoided they cause alzheimer and what's that uhm what's alzheimer alzheimer disease a disease of the brain in which your brain cells are attacked or die then you become totally confused you don't recognise your children it's not the alzheimer's alzheimer's i thought alzoner's alsaimer's i thought it was alzheimer's alzheimer's disease alzheimer's but it's spelt a l z h ya a l z and then h l is a high but i don't know that's how i pronounce it i don't know i've never heard it said so i ya i think i have heard it said but i can't remember they have they have a programme once uhm sbc i think that they showed this old man looking after his wife who had what i called alzheimer's disease and they always they've been saying my mother  word  really at one stage at one stage she nearly was word  but i don't word  it's not just simple forgetfulness it's uh it involves disorientation ya but are when you are a certain age i think you'll get disorient disoriented that's right you can't see you can't see but you're not sure why you see there are many types of severity it could be senile and not forget and not remember people but you don't do odd things or think that you're son is a thief or something i think what sometime old people do that you know like they they misplace things and they will accuse everybody around them that's right if they can't find they'll say oh somebody has taken it or they act very irrationally like uh do very strange things in the house  word medically you know and the doctor sort of sacrifice they can be mistaken for to be mad because of the weird things they do got tied up you know word  that's why a lot of people want their old folks at home don't want them to run around then forget their address and unable to get back home it's not really so cruel as people think we'll have no idea what we'll be like that when we get old true what a depressing subject yes you can please move on from considering disease we can on back to food tell us about your niece oh my niece uhm well the one who comes to our house very delightful smiles at you all the time and she seldom has tantrum ya how old is she she is nine months nine months this is your latest niece so quickly ah i remember you're just it was like yesterday you were saying ah ya they came the last time no this i have two in the states who comes over once uhm about two years but this one is born in singapore the same sister no it's different sister and she comes over to our house everyday everyday because both parents work so your mother looks after them oh i'm sure she's delighted 
Singapore	uh which holiday are you talking about talking about our next year holiday hor i thought we agree we go to canada so that canada is definite right something like that lah what do you mean something like that canada is definite otherwise i don't want to go anywhere i thought we're going europe uhm canada and europe can can we combine together the two it'll be pretty expensive uh so we have to plan it properly otherwise the cost will be very high but some of my friends said that it's not possible they say that you'll take too long and that it's uhm it's going to be a very expensive like you said it's going to be very expensive  word  then they say that uhm can we get to see uhm very much of the two countries if we do it this way you know hopping from canada to europe what do you think no we can have a short stay in canada first we don't have to visit the whole of canada just visit few important cities that are interesting but i thought canada is so big and uh i ya but we don't have to go everywhere for example okay just go toronto to see the largest city in canada then we can take a bus and travel across the canadian provinces from ontario to manitova to uh british columbia then go vancouver from there we'll hop into the plane and then proceed to europe that means we're going to hop you're going to hop onto a plane at vancouver ya we can stay in canada for about a week or a week and a half can we see can we still see so many things yes in a week yes but uhm what about the the wild life that's what i want to see i want to see can the canadian uhm the canadian countryside the indian villages and you know all those all those famous lakes and uhm what do you call those uh uhm uhm reserves the natural reserves nature reserves sorry of course depends on what you want to see where you want to go you see one and half week should be more than enough because in toronto we'll just stay for two days all right from toronto we travel to manitova that'll take about two and a half days in between the bus bus journey uh roads ya bus journey we can uh to stop by way along the way from toronto to manitova to see countryside where the prairies are then if you want to go and see that indian villages at vancouver remember the book did i will call my name was it was it vancouver was it was ya ya set in vancouver that was in vancouver that's where the book i will call my name is set that'll take another three days so it's about seven and a half days only seven and a half days add another two more days for travelling from manitova to vancouver so it'll be just nice of course it'll be a little bit a little bit rush a little bit hectic uh but i think we can manage it so you already have a rough itinerary planned is it yes darling  word half week if not we can we can actually just drop in at vancouver and forget about toronto no i want to see as much of canada as possible and i also want to go to lake word university cos i want to see i want to see your university i want to see how small it is and and how obscure it is shut up why you you insulted uh i insulted your university uhm but seriously i want to see where you spend that three years of your life pursuing your degree and and also uhm want to see who are these professors who talk about who seem to think so highly of you i want to find out whether is it true that they really think so highly of you anyway we can always take a plane from toronto to vancouver or take a plane from lake word to vancouver that will cut down the journey from one and a half weeks to one week maybe but doesn't it mean then we spend another three more weeks in europe no but isn't taking planes even inter-city planes isn't it uhm more expensive than taking the bus the greyhound is it is it the greyhound they have greyhounds of course in canada of course i thought greyhound's only used in the united states no it's trans-north america oh so if we take the plane we we will have to pay more right is it very much more from where i don't know you just said that from one from vancouver to toronto and then or from lake word upwards of course uh from toronto to vancouver cost us about four hundred canadian dollars air ticket uh ya one way from then what about if we take the greyhound bus greyhound is about two hundred over canadian but they are valid for thirty days oh so if so i guess that we'll be doing most of our travelling by the greyhound right unless we're really yes word if we are if we planned to see the countryside then we have to take the bus ya uhm good i can't wait for this holiday so i've been thinking and thinking don't think too much plan for it i can't wait for our second honeymoon and and and really think i deserve a holiday after all this june holidays i hardly in fact we didn't go anywhere out of singapore okay okay so one and a half week in canada canada where what else uhm see i also want to go to some of the places you have some of the places where you you have skid uh to see you in action since you claim that you are such a wonderful skier i i want to see you go down the slopes and you know see how wonderful tumble down right no no i didn't say tumble down you don't snowing down right uh rolling down snowballing down maybe so horrible no i really want to see i i only see you skate any any anyway where which europe country are we going why you so keen to change the conversation i'm still interested in canada for your information too short too short a day too short the days to to discuss too detailed about what to unless you want to spend more than two weeks but that's our not the original plan so i think we sh i i don't think we have even discussed the original plan i think you better discuss some which country you want to visit which countries which which which you want to visit in europe uhm do we do ouch stop pinching me do we want to go to europe or just or just england i thought you want to visit most most of europe then how come now england only i don't think we can i mean we i i think we really got to plan uh our european tour very carefully because i don't think we're going to get to see very much of one country if we intend to hop you know if we intend to cover as many countries as possible in europe in fact uhm i think if we if we decide to go europe we might as well give up england you know because england by itself by itself has got so much to offer i mean in terms of sight and i mean tour tourist sights and historical i mean hist historical sights as well so some of my friends have told me that actually you can spend maybe a whole month in england so i think maybe we either go england and spend the three weeks there or we we we go just europe backpacking in europe and if we do backpacking in europe i think we should uhm visit places like uhm okay definitely france uhm holland holland mainly because i want to see the tulip the tulips and the uhm what uh the tulips the windmills and cer and and a little bit of the redlight district to find out whether it's really really red so that's definitely europe tour and i have said uhm i don't mind spending the whole in that case got to see a lot more and cut down the number of days in canada no but i want because anyway you cannot spend too much time and too much money on one trip but i uhm actually uh i'd rather concentrate more on canada i know you you have spent three years you have spent three years there darling so that therefore therefore you therefore you want to go europe whereas for me i haven't seen canada right and neither have i seen europe but i'm more interested in canada because because that's kind of a second home to you so it's for your sake it's okay for the first trip we just go canada and england and that's it canada and england then for the europe trip we should make it on a second round where where we'll visit the real europe but will we be able to have another backpacking trip why not because by that time what happens if we if buy some four-ds what happen what happen if if if i get pregnant and then how am i going to backpack with with a child inside me you front pack don't talk nonsense front pack but uh i don't know you sound really keen to go to europe you really want to go europe uh whoa you don't have to be so nice word  okay so so countryside you mean you don't mind not going back to canada next year uh of course not of course i'd like to visit to if i can make it a chance see visit instead of backpacking visit uhm why i want to backpack or we just visit one or two cities so few uh all i can say make it into two trips first trip two countries three four years later another trip uhm maybe by then they have invented space shuttle around the world space shuttle round the world ya who would who will invent it you right of course aiyah still can't decide whether to go just canada and england or or a little bit of each i think anyway don't forget you also have to save for the renovation of the house so that what does that mean we still got to decide right no one piece of word you cannot cut into too many pieces it'll cut you right so what are you trying to say philosopher yep please please go on and explain your your your wise saying so it's either we have more money for one trip more places but less stays per places or multiple trips longer days per places and wait longer in in between the trips or what we can do is we can still go canada one and a half weeks and then maybe select certain cities in europe that means we don't get to cover all of europe right or like you said we just go canada and england what do you think about that england is part to europe no england is separate by itself it's now part of eec they have a common dollar now so okay lah since you want to be so so so there's a tube now you want to be from england to to french england to france uh naw to french because it's french fries uhm don't talk nonsense we're taped so i guess really have to discuss this a little further right  but have no time to talk about the car already so i think uhm ya we'll discuss the other issues another day right 
Singapore	should have added more custard lah and my pie crust cracked also oh we are being recorded are we  word  oh are we being recorded okay and then everybody will be tongue-tied can imagine i'm sure the bird doesn't count as another person word meow does she of course not how does how did she learn all these meow and whistling and all that it's just because of the cat oh word  no word  no what that's my mother's indian name pakir oh uhm we well we got her when she was like six months old and someone was moving house and didn't want her oh so my grandmother took her in and uh she my grandma used to used to give her chilli a bit to just aggravate her throat ya just take her out clip her wings so now she can't fly uhm so even if you let her loose word a cat will probably pounce on her ya and she uhm she's very strong she's eighteen years old you know ya so she like forgets some of the things she learnt like like ten years ago unless you remind her again uhm ya like she used to say bawa ya uh ya so now her repertoire seems to be more ya  word uhm limited ya you know she's forgetting things you have to keep you have to bring it back to her mind you know uhm there was the word about the so interesting the minor act uh oh ya oh yes so more classic word  this is actually the the indonesian hill mynah word we went to kotak gedeh to get ear-rings i mean to buy silver jewellery whatever uhm and uhm there were two cat uh birds like this uhm one of them said selamat pagi i mean it was so cute and then the other one selamat selamat lakom ah selamat lakom very low voice that was a male oh that was so funny ya ya interesting pet uhm dog was very old  word  she's nine uhm uhm she we picked her from the road i mean my auntie picked her up from the road jalan kayu the two cats are our strays too she picked or someone else picked it she picked uhm came into the school came into jalan kayu primary school and then at that time we just lost our dog about six months before so she asked whether we wanted one so said ya so cute uhm like a replacement for the old the other dog word uhm but she's very uh she's very lethargic she she's very lazy uhm eats a lot i mean we don't give her much but she eats everything and she doesn't lose weight at all with a good cook at home i think word  ya no not really she just gets word  she just fed around word  you can't get recorded ya she only gets fed once a day and she's still very fat uhm why does she have to be punished uhm why does she have to be punished uhm she slept she slept on my sofa my two thousand dollar sofa uhm we can't afford uhm the thing is to uphaul so the whole thing cost me one thousand dollars it's half the price of a sofa uhm so does she word scratch on the sofa and all that well i know she won't but the cats would uhm but still we don't i mean i don't fancy her sitting on my two thousand dollar sofa ya take my bed my bed is cheaper how how are those cookies  word why is she why are you taping nobody talked about it no it's okay leave it oh you're doing it already right ya that's good she can edit right no no can't uh no well just be thankful you're not on word  air ya radio one that would be worse i think ya i'm just petrified i remember once there was uhm  word  food exhibition yes i was on air and where i was on some word ware oh is it sbc what no uhm radio one radio one ya and i kept like saying rubbish i mean total rubbish i mean i would like what do i say i mean oops can you erase that start again i mean like three times then sometimes in the midst of it i'd make a mistake and then she'll say never mind lah just edit it word  maybe just repeat you know she was nervous good thing it wasn't live no wasn't live ya if it's live it's worse uh  word thing ya uhm  word wonder sometimes when i listen to the radio and these people keep making mistakes and i think they are nervous oh ya ya of course very nervous uhm ya melissa appeared you know on sunday news or whatever oh last sunday or was it monday i didn't catch the news nowadays uhm uhm me too uhm swing swing uhm uhm do you like the pie i like this the pie is not bad but i prefer this uhm i like that too you like that okay ya brenda did you try it try this one before we finish up ya try try before these people finish i keep eyeing for that i made that one tuesday or wednesday uhm i froze the i had to freeze the pastry overnight uhm the dough the mixture and then when it comes out it's like hard like rock then you just thaw it for a while and you just quickly work at it and you dump it to the oven uhm uhm the pie is not bad but a bit soft uh is it supposed to be like that no it's supposed to be harder uhm ya firmer but the taste is okay right  word  ya the taste is good how many times have you made this this pie it's my first time oh it's an experiment too ya it's a miracle i don't know how i can serve you all experiments  word this your potential word  word well actually a regular custard pie is when you make it with condensed milk whereas this is the custard pie with the custard powder the regular custard pie is when you bake the whole thing with the pie so that's why my pie i bake my pie crust separately and it cracked because usually for a regular after you make a pie crust you add this metallic thing to it you know it's like it's it's in a shape of like a high dish type thing and it's usually word  and you press it down so that when the pie bakes it wouldn't pluff up and break and i didn't do that you see i just had to take the risk ya i can i've only found that thing in the states maybe i should get my friends to you know send it to me uhm ya 'cos this is the first time i've made other pies but they've always been like you bake the whole thing uhm you know the cats are speaking  word ya hungry does it mean that you have to buy a lot of all these bowls and moulds and things like that ya i have plenty we've all sorts of things uh all the different shapes auntie dying to say something i'm afraid you can't you haven't got to university you haven't had the privilege of having tertiary education poor me i think she has to edit all this rubbish do you used to do this

Singapore	so how how's the special session whoa you want me to talk about the special session that one no confi closed meeting how can i talk about special session oh closed meeting uh uh you cannot tell us about simon who will be posted to which uh uh gabriel will be here right it's confirmed uh what else you can tell us about him he's married you don't know him uh uh well i met him when i was at ttc he's married with three kids how old is he his wife is not working oh well and he is in his what uh early thirties ya early thirties he's about he's about uh shimin's age uh even though he didn't go university mai mai's age uh ya but three kids already you know very productive you know  word  i don't know how she's going to transcribe that man he called me earlier today wanting to see me because soh soon has directed him uh so poh soon was telling me only library uh only mission so he said library and other areas so i congratulated him lah but did uh your your is mary going to nominated for library again if not her who who can stand in her in her position this coming next next on twenty-third is nominations  word  but that would be up to the senior pastor to propose uh ya he will propose lah but nominations could word  agree or disagree with him but if able to disagree then i would assume that  word alternative bigger no lah my you you you are the better person to tell him what who who has been working in the library committee if you uh talk about experience i don't think you can get anyone word  so there're other people within the church uh that are that are qualified to do this job but you have old old old timers mrs basti old timers probably they have own problem uh mr mr mr what's his name uh tsk word  indonesian mr suvant uh mis mr surata surata ya uhm i'm not sure whether he can do it or not he used to right it's more than just sitting and directing people to do when you classify your books it's quite a professional job and mary is professionally trained to do that we used to have one girl remember her she was trained in library work in uk you know i heard about that and then she she got married to a church member from another church alamak we lost one potential librarian there marriage uh uh you taping this uh it's already on so how's your flat i don't know man i just received a letter from uh hdb uhm they're saying the the it's it's been approved lah the sale has been approved the sale of your flat or the one which you you're going to the sale of my flat has been approved and uh this this uh just think i i need another month's time i can get a we should get a letter to go and sign on the legal documents uh but my problem now is this old man who bought over my house he wants to come in and start planning the renovation while i'm still there old man uh days are numbered that might be create quite a problem uh because of my house now a lot of junk uhm did we've got boxes lying around then my antiques why don't you just show him the plan i don't have a plan my friend you know the plan uh you want to get a copy of the plan you got to pay you know you ask him see how much five five dollars per copy ever since i moved in ever since i ever since i moved in i never paid i never bought the plan but in this new house that i bought the owner bought a plan and gave me a copy but i thought when i got my flat they gave me free ha i i didn't pay for it i didn't buy a plan they just gave me a a plan of my flat are you sure ya nowadays you got to buy you know really uh how old is your flat about six years ah about the same time same as mine what six years exactly uh but mine all included with the sales agreement i don't think my wife paid for it i didn't pay maybe it's all in all added up into the sum you pay you don't know maybe lah maybe uh you can ask him to buy lah you pay how much can it cost not much lah search fee maybe two dollars about ten dollars uh not much lah but but it's a way of making money what ah just i just came back from hdb pastor wee ya uh just word can you come to the phone for a while uh just a minute uh is it urgent or not urgent yes okay were you around at the peter lewis seminar no i was yesterday i missed service sunday service uh uh how was the seminar i i think for the night meetings uh about two hundred plus two hundred plus uh two hundred twenty thirty i expected more uh uhm but were these people church members or outside most of them were church members but i i i i'm beginning to see uhm maybe we we need to we need to we need to strategize the publicity remember two two two years ago your missions conference was goyak no mission conference was okay two years ago remember when uh terence was organising it oh when i was still a student attendance put the record straight i was a student not working yet the attendance was terrible remember only about a few people turned up and that unless unless you push hard uh people will not come uh uh we were just talking about it last night with uh danny and uh my wife and philip uhm uhm it's it's information overkill they look up the bulletin on sunday there're too many too many things too many it's information overload the system breakdown they don't know how to prioritize uhm which one to attend which one not to attend uhm so in the end they glaze over everything and nothing seems in that's probably just one one factor i think the other point you need to see is the period in which you began your publicity long time ago you know long time when when when was long time ago i wrote a letter to all the the small group leaders you know about one and a half months ago but you you didn't have prayer meeting calling the small group leaders to pray no which we did our mission conference preparation took about a year it's just the preparation and then we have our quarterly uh mission prayer night and we made it a point to emphasize to point out this mission conference i suppose the other the other thing is how you sell how you sell the publicity uhm put the topic like that you'll deter a lot of people from coming ya ya only those who are really interested come the the the topic itself tells you what is expected uh ya spiritual movement not everybody wants word  not everybody wants discipleship too it's it scares people away the topic ya discipleship word  you can word with missions what when you organize a missions conference people interested in  word  those not interested won't come so in the but i i think on the whole those who came really benefited they were small group leaders most of them but i there were a lot more small group leaders who didn't turn up uhm somehow they word that's good ya well i i think uh uh he's a good fellow to fall back for something word conference uh talking about a bible conference sunday school word  seminar or something of that sort 'cos his exposition is quite good that's supposed to be his specialty what's his background baptist evangelical baptist yes but he preached at uh he was a good friend of martin lloyd jones really martin lloyd jones got him to preach word so did oh really so uh so his style of preaching is martin lloyd jones' uhm you read martin lloyd jones books and listen to his tapes and uh the style is about the same but i when i was sitting down talking to him i i think right now he might be coming back here quite often because he's made contacts with uh church of singapore he's made contacts with uh anglican church oh is it and i think his own church in uk is finally releasing him uhm to go on this kind of tours so if you want to you can call him again maybe family camp will be good if they talk about wesley wesley camp pointing or focused on activities this time perhaps focus on bible study word  if we have if we have a bible conference word but uh i think next year will be a different conference inviting somebody else whole flavour will change maybe we just have too many conferences that's  word  that's another possibility lah we have we have too many programs in town uh uh people have to choose so it's overload overkill ya uh don't know lah i hope i i'm i'm glad that i have finished this project so this one of your projects for this year so now i'm looking forward to moving house again uh that that will be a new project new church here not a project uh what new church here new church here what september ya lah ya lah but i i have to start working now you know on what word  got to start packing i've not even packed my clothes my things to go off uh you frequent traveller what's the problem frequent traveller aiyah you i hate i hate to you've travelled so often to to riau you travelled so often batam nothing glamourous you know to to malaysia ah what's the difference just top up a few uh thick clothing winter you're going there in the winter right no it'll be fall lah ya but you'll be running through winter ya  word  ya ya uh but i think you can tahan sejok lah my my fat is it your blubber the last time you studied was at dallas right dallas ya dallas is hot ya this one i was told that uh the word  winter uh as long as three months you know how low snow snow how low minus snow uh ah i guess minus uh i wrote to them asked them for temperature range they said will be cool for them cool is different from this cool you know cool that's relative you know ah their cool is not like uh sanyo air-con cool their cool is more like deep-freeze cool freezing man but i look forward to go lah but michigan is near the lakes right the great lakes ya word my seminary is just near the lake frozen in winter ya it'll be cold that's where scholars are made you know bring your chilli padi lah chilli padi gejok only pop one chilli padi inside sambal balachan is uh is pauline going to cook for you ya i think that's the cheapest uh don't touch the food that an american has touched do your own thing lah just buy the raw material from the farmers' market if you go to supermarket also it'll be very expensive ya when i took peter and valerie out yesterday afternoon for lunch they said that's very very something they seldom do over there  uh because for them to to eat out it's word  ten times more than cooking at home so for them after church uh it's usually  word  lunch means we take you home for lunch here lunch we take you out for lunch but if you are to uh to to eat out over there i mean if you buy and cook in then uh uh from what i heard from uh gujang who goes there quite often it's cheap uh cheaper lah cook your own food lah we have kitchenette i was told that we're going to stay in at one of the cottages the school has no dormitory uh but they have several cottages so we have to take care of the garden in winter we're supposed to shove the snow uh in spring we got to cut the grass and like that that lah and then you get paid for that no lah that's part of our roster duty man you you're staying in a community hostel uh it's a it's a it's like it's a seminary and they've their own cottages where students reside ah cottage condo like that lah something like that lah 
Singapore	what are we drinking actually what is yours uh mine is milk tea plus pearl oh this one lah milk tea plus pearl ya me two uhm mine is uh i think is jasmine green tea plus pearl as well not here they have jasmine tea mint would you want to try okay try mine also don't mind if i do uhm nice yours is good too ya so sad no butter cake but it's actually on the menu how about red bean cake i don't think they have any cakes oh they don't they haven't they haven't made this yet uhm this is is a nice place ya i like it the other time we were when we were here after that a lot of people came in ya it always happens with you always with you let's hope it happens again today or today will be a different one don't say always leh hasn't happen yet i'm sure no because of you you are here that's why but the whole world is in front of me now i don't need to see other people well said man you should i say the same thing you like your milk tea oh i love it that's good we were talking about felicity right uhm ya it was such a letdown towards the end of course they won't want to tell us who she went off with ya you know these hollywood they want to you know bring it to a climax to a point where you need to watch the next season to find out like friends right uhm every season they end with ross and rachel going to come together but you don't know whether they come together what they call a cliffhanger ya they always do that so but i found one thing very interesting don't know whether whether you noticed when you were watching throughout the whole the whole the whole whole show the show uses a piece of music classical music oh yes that's the one you lent me what is it called it's called bolero by ravel ya that's right i remember it starts with one instrument and then it goes on to have more and more instruments yes that's right and everything reaches a climax to the end yes so it's interesting that they use this music and you find the music each sequence getting louder and louder you know you are going to reach a climax but the sad thing is that the climax is the next season but half way through the they changed music it's no longer that ravel music oh ya they changed it half way through well i have not finished watching it it's quite good uh the suspense ya the way they build up i think it's coming true people are coming in ya you see they are at cool station i told you it will happen but like i said one more time the world the world is in front of me thank you you were saying you like mad about you the recent episode ya that was nice right it's nice it was very heartwarming i would say you know my tears just rolled down when at the moment when they broke off and you wonder why for all the small reasons i mean he when they break up all the couples in the world would have broken up so many times over again i like the way it's told you have the daughter you know narrating and then it flashes back to how they were trying to come together cute and the daughter it's cute uh ya quite cute very cute the way she talks what's the girl's name again uh mabel helen hunt no her screen name so it's paul and jamie bucman ya i saw that part where they were at the altar and jamie asked herself she said no i cannot do this and then she left the altar ya i saw that part too saw that part uh but why why why do you think i mean you you are a lady what intuitive thing can you think of i don't know maybe she thought that after all they have been together for so long they brought up this girl so what so why is there a need to come together ya i was thinking also maybe maybe maybe she is just sentimental of old things so to do something new again maybe she scared that may change certain things or something like that maybe she didn't want to do it what's the point of doing it maybe she just needed paul to say yes i will marry you and to say i do first that's all she needed uhm maybe that's all she need ya but i just find it sad they broke off for those reasons what are those reasons i can't quite recall paul said that he couldn't stand her criticisms anymore to a point where she always he always feels that she is always right and he has to be the wrong one all the time and he left because he couldn't couldn't stand it how did did they came back together right that's why it's so heartwarming yes ya ya let's refresh how did they come back together again they went to the premiere of their daughter's movie the daughter their daughter made a movie sort of a sort of about their lives so it is a movie that makes them come back together i think is much more than that but i think that's the catalyst ya but all along i think even when they are off each other they still love each other a lot ya that's nice i love the screen chemistry the chemistry between them paul and jamie it's really good incidentally she is nominated again this year for the emmy award for best actress she won two years running already she just got married isn't it ya you know to who helen hunt ya azaria ya the guy is in mad about you the dog trainer the dog trainer you know the dog trainer how about friends last night what do you think of it did you watch i watch but on and off uhm so don't really have an impression what do you think wait wait wait what was happening last night uh they have a ball game oh they quite silly right they wanted to throw at first it was only joey and uh ross ross they wanted to keep it up for about two hours and then monica came in and join them and then they went on for up to four hours ya i mean kind of silly funny in a sense then rachel came back with that cat that looks like a monster ya and joey kept saying that's not a cat that was quite cute that was quite cute so it was about the cat that doesn't look like a cat on a red pillow red cushion when you you watched austin powers oh yes the cat looks exactly like that austin powers cat the evil oh the evil doctor evil doctor evil's cat ya i didn't notice that and she tried to sell it off she bought it for one thousand dollars and she sold it at a profit she sold it for thousand five thousand five not bad uh because the guy had a had a crush on her uhm so wanted to please her tonight ally mcbeal ya do you think it would be a good season this time is is actually a repeat repeat of what of all the interesting episodes of the two seasons so tcs just take out the interesting bits from all they chose fourteen episodes but they say it's the first of the the first season the first season oh i see oh ya this this movie called a man called hero they said it's terrible what kind of terrible things you hear oh like what you told me the other day how come he can just jump and reach the moon so incredible and uh actually for chinese movies we want to look for good sword fights and kung fu and things like that you know but even my malay students they said that it's terrible malay students malay students what do you think i think well it is the same team who did the stormriders and the guy said he wanted to do it better so i think he i think i misunderstand the word better better means reach the moon ya ya ya so you must jump higher you know the kung fu must be more outrageous it's terrible right still still in the good old days they made a tv serial out of it and that one is very good the series was very long about thirty or forty episodes i remember it was one of the best series around zhong hua ying xiong zhong hua ying xiong it's not easy for them to condense three hundred copies of comic books stories into a two hour movie they have to take out all the best bits of the comic book and put it into the movie guess it's a bit difficult too sounds like you are defending them well i have not watch it yet but i think i will probably won't like it well i think this thing about special effects sometimes it makes it thin in a way you know the plot the depth of character is not there so sometimes together with the depth of character and good characterisation good plot with special effects i think it will make a good movie ya that's right the actors are quite good right in this case e-kin uhm he fits the persona of a man called hero if you read the comic books he looks almost exactly you know really like the comic hero he fits the role but as a movie is it a good one i mean in terms of uh you know you study films so in terms of that you think is it a good movie you haven't watched it yet actually i haven't watched it yet but i uh read enough i see enough to know a little bit i guess what helps the movie maybe is the chemistry of him he has the a kind of certain charisma that fits the role that melancholic person that walks the earth and knows that whatever relationship people forms with him uh won't stand the test of time that relationship will probably die because he is a curse on earth and he fits the persona you know he looks sad all the time so looks like he has a role to play to to save the world is it but for himself he cannot form meaningful relationships deep ones ya deep ones that's why i think in the movie also he has a son and uh he refused to acknowledge him and the son keep asking him why don't you want to acknowledge me because you know he feels that he is superstitious in a way uh it might interfere with his role as a hero ya does he have a wife ya yang but she was killed half way through the movie and you know these movies sword fighting movies is always about revenge aiyah the lady always dies and then the hero will go on not my story my story won't happen it's all right she's got a role to play she has got nothing to do so she must die makes it more sad i mean sword fighting movies are always like that hor the ladies are just flower pots what i mean i'm saying sword fighting movies flower pots flower pots uhm i don't like that i don't like that too make a movie that is different  but there are some where the ladies play a part uh i think there was one chinese show chinese movie you lent me where the lady also fights fong sai yuk oh yes the mother that was funny the mother she was really good right 
Singapore	i'm shifting to the marketing department uh uhm uh what's the date that you're going uh lin chin has said that um it's with effect from august that's nice uh actually what's the proper procedure the uh supposed we have word  i have to speak to kok wah because probably he already gave the clearance from what i right ya but then uh admin has to ya we have to issue a note to say you are henceforth posted to the new section okay so since word cleared i don't expect too much problems but uh who's replacing you uh i think that uh admin's supposed to have recruit is it ya that's why we have to look at this recruitment in about new aos we've got quite a few applicants but we don't know whether we want to you know advertise another round again ya do we have vacancies ya your vacancy because we've shifted you word all right and uh some other vacancy you know okay around so uh when edie comes back lah he's away until twenty twentieth so when he comes back we'd probably get his clearance to do something probably do another round because at the moment we're doing the clerks and the lower paid staff uhm so after that uh after we finish that round of interviews then we'll come back to the word business again there're quite a few applicants but i think maybe my word  it it depends on him oh when when when to do it you see okay so uh so what have you been doing there have you started work there ya uhm i'm helping out with the word  dinner which is august the third ah third ya and then uh i think suzanne is giving me uh it's indicated that uh uhm uh i should do certain projects lah right uh like just now i was uh creating a file for uh this this violinist from england ah with his academy he's going on tour in september ninety three and you're going to get sponsors for that group whatever ya i see quite a number of staff uh in bm bmw in october they're going to bring in either a opera or singing oh that's nice in october this year yes uh bmw is sponsoring is it ya joined with nac ya ah that's great we are presenting uhm so what what's the opera i don't really know if it's an opera actually but or is a musical ya something like that it's on the music side is it ya ya that's fine and then so is it kallang  word i think that's the biggest venue lah uhm ya well i'm sure we're all looking forward to going ya so how after festival of arts not dead yet no lah immigration almost killed me okay ya but i think that's sorted out quite well and the indian group did come ya that one that uh i helped you to clear ya but uh i think in the i think the post-mortem helps in the sense that uh it prepares the next person next person who is ya going to take over you see but we're probably trying to catch the same person 'cos then the person no will know the job better oh no well if you don't want uh you probably have to do logistics of other sorts anyway or worse wait till they present you with ticketing where you have to be like connie and get scolding from the public oh no oh that's worse you know i'm not looking forward to it man ya but that's uh that's one in two years right but uh i think i had sleepless nights man about this ya i know word sleepless nights about something or other so that's why they are going to give you all a thank you lunch or dinner not me all of us all of us all of us really every single one either chairman or minister will give something i mean a thank you  word  oh this year and uh council did say i think it's recorded in my notes oh hi we're like having a taped conversation she's doing some survey work could you come in oh okay fine right okay fine okay right uh this one has to do with some endowment policy we've been doing some research work there oh ya uhm so how to invest our money word  ya i think uh quite good lah now that after a year it's been a year uhm and i'm paying income tax oh i just brought in my income tax form today and uh have you all got any new sponsors in mind don't name them in the tape though oh ya uh ya is this going to be confidential i hope so uhm but we haven't discussed any word  my career moves no but i mean it's like it's already known right because uh kok wah ya has agreed to it and uh you know shouldn't worry about it ya it's just that i think it's a very exciting area to go into but i think so you should also maybe get suzanne's help or yourself because we don't have the time really if there are any marketing courses uh or fund-raising fund-raising usually they don't have fund-raising we usually have to internally organize but uh i suppose suzanne can uh give you some advice ya 'cos some of the courses that i'm word  i'm seeing someone on the sixteenth this fellow is from don't-know-what university uh uh this was before i think what lester or what lest what don't know which university in uk now they they've converted into a university no that was a polytechnic before now it's converted to a university let me see where he's from grayham chapman hai i forgot which university word gave me the card he he's coming here and i was seeing whether we can link up because there're like only two universities that do arts admin courses you know uhm this one and of course city university london ya but i i think the states practically every other university has arts admin course really ya they've got a whole manual oh i'm i'm so glad that uhm you are word  no i've had the word ya but the thing is that we are debating as to whether you really need to uh if you are already a graduate it's not necessary to do a like three-year arts admin course because the arts admin course covers a lot of areas which you already know that's true uh marketing if you're econs graduate statistics and all that you probably want to do like diploma kind you know uhm or selected credit subjects uhm uhm but what if we uh are interested in say uh a marketing course uh in in institute of singapore if ya uh you see we are quite liberal uh who is this person uh yong kian is already enrolled for a pr course you know and we paid for it if you do come across a marketing course which i think sim and all that has yes yes ya get a brochure let us know apply to us we definitely consider because we also get sdf funding 'cos that mean we don't need to pay in total i see oh this is word  so even for yong kian's one we're getting some sdf funding okay okay but i hear her she's it's a very uh short-term no course right it's like uh only about about few months but she sits for ya ya a few months and then she gets a cert uhm but you see i think uh yours could be a longer one ya it could be a diploma ya so we i do not know the detailed arrangements but if say you it's relevant to your area of work uhm we will support if it's not too expensive and you can get sdf funding word  we got to look at that aspect and then also uh i don't know whether they'll bond people i mean if we pay and oh whether we'll bond them but oh i see i mean if if it's only two three thousand i don't think we'll bond them okay uh but then like yong kian was saying that she wanted us to pay her membership fee after she's completed the course but i think that's not fair lah because after you complete a course it's already your own personal one whether you want to continue membership fee ya i think what this institute of what public public relation oh that that's a different ya ya it's so ya thing word altogether uh so you should look at those sim courses because i think you can even take exams that are you know marked by accredited uh institutions abroad uh uhm so you do come out with another skill a danger of training you people so well you become so marketable you say goodbye to us at the end of it oh ya but then no risk no gain uhm well we expect well you you have some commitment uh uh but you'll probably say you want some career path mapped out for you too ya uh uh so you i mean we will well in a way if we were to to train you and all it's already part of career development and all that and it also would depend on your performance and what they they uhm consider i mean we have to look at your cep lah cep is always moving you know what is cep or not current estimated potential rising hopefully uh uhm so like some people when they come in it's like in government's eyes all scholars have very high cep future perm secs oh that kind of thing but uh i think that any investment will will entail some form of risk lah ya so uh you're investing in your manpower uhm well there's risk involved we we have to like say after you finish your course you say goodbye uhm that will quite sad ya but then marketing people are so in demand and the market outside pays so well uhm you know it's a problem keeping people so maybe i don't know hold on a minute wow so loud that's myself going for a course i've always nominated people for courses it's a local course i need to go there  word administration uh for a job evaluation oh uhm two full days and then that's in july end of july and then uh two full days in august selecting the right people for the right job no not really job evaluation is like you know uh you evaluate the worth of the job you know that that's the then from there then they'll determine the market value of the job ah uhm we can see the application word  so that after you've done that then you can come up with a new salary structure uhm uhm well i mean this has been very fruitful i mean discussing your career prospects and what we are doing uh ya is the fifteen minutes up yet or do we have another another okay so i don't know what else you want to talk about about the tailors  word no no tell tell me about your golfing where do you golf and uh sembawang  word range i went last evening also no i graduated from the range and on the course already oh and uh i think it's good lah because it's uphill and downhill so it does keep you physically quite fit i was telling barbara that now i'm so disciplined that i wake up so early and you know wow i i don't feel so tired uhm i'm really on the go so uhm uhm the new catherine uh  ya ha ha ha ha no i don't know how long that is i mean it's not like those early days and we all were like so stressed and you know oh ya i i think those days when i looked back at it it's like i i i looked at it like from you know it's as though you know it's a nightmare i mean you know there must i mean ya it's like that things have been much more word ya and then like more space for people you know people are getting used to their work so they don't come ka chow you everyday well this room helps ya it does doesn't it ya ya well but then also i think outside is much better because we always want programmer which is like the noisest people well that's not true  word  not true is it very noisy outside still uh certain days uhm you're just you're just amazed you just like it's very difficult to look up and ya like where does the noise come from it's quite difficult to concentrate isn't it especially when you're trying to you know work out something especially word  uhm 
Singapore	when are you going to make your passport where do you renew your passport today i am going down to the bank and then after that oh shit i need to go to the branch  word on wednesday so so if if the if the ya what what what important thing you can word  especially who say  word go as a group word ya correct correct word  four days package you have two days of sight-seeing and two days free correct i think i think that is a very good programme lah word you can get to know people word   word it is gonna be just great from the house  word in a good sense haadyai is the place where you go for massages no but of course you know what i mean orlando girls are mobile word  no ya i think this is a good programme what do you think i am sure we will get to know some people definitely hope there will be a lot people thirty over people in our whole trip lah if there is just three of us then uh when word  there will be a group in a group they they will be more careful we come from agencies word  three three wait three guys another three guys come in how triple sharing ah ya room three ah cancel and go bangkok never mind it is only four days the lady told me that the chances of getting the confirmed flight back to singapore is are good whenever they are but if no uncertainty also ah ya she may be worried that is the problem i don't know how her definite word come back gone it is quite true some people use this to make money using this kind of thing and then we won't go around to make again creatures of the night thing if that falls through then we have nowhere to go that means we have to opt for the three day one no no why don't actually we can actually call them and ask them if they pull through we can make other arrangement but they can't just keep on offer when you promise us that  word right now they keep us on hold then we can't go to other agency it is not fair you see so it is not that if that is the case then we opt for a three day two night by then hundred dollar cheaper two nine nine oh they don't have that i think they don't have oh wait wait i ask oh oh room service word  you didn't tell me about word   word fuss over this issue whereby they delaying delaying us his cheapness is revealing what he is getting cheaper by the hour  word problem is just like we just be going just one day well if we find a seat early the morning we come up come back late at night i ask ronald when i was word three day four night lah word  exactly if he wants to laze around lah i think he needs that roughly if you want to laze around three days is more than sufficient two full days of time one full day of night of course the night life there is quite great a lot of basically you can see the international people they have disco over there ya it is at the hard the rock hard not hard rock cafe if you know what i mean they have those pasar malam there right just like in pattaya right it is all lined up along the road along the street then it is very much like pattaya i suppose ya but more cosmopolitan in the sense that you have a  word  what do you mean by cosmopolitan well different type of different type of people there different types of people mainly caucasians  word  how much do you think we have we need to change up to you if you are impulsive spender then you will have to change more but i think hundred sing is sufficient for four days you have to bear in mind we have to pay airport tax over that side it is two hundred baht if i am not mistaken unless they have revise the charges any case oh ya if you want to go for the cabaret show  word it is two hundred and fifty baht so it is about uh twenty twenty dollars uh eighteen twenty dollars the ratio baht to sing one to fifteen one sing to fifteen baht last time i went ten years ago was one to eight now it is one to fifteen so good one to fifteen uh one singapore is equivalent to fifteen baht so one baht is about uh seven one divide by fifteen one hundred baht seven seven sing dollars one hundred baht will be seven sing dollars so when was the last time you went early april may when my time was around the same ya one fifteen also no ya one fifteen i went in nineteen eighty eight one fifteen ah ya  word  quite close to taiwanese tai pi ninety dollars i think also i don't think i will be spending much five hundred four hundred and fifty baht word  how much do you intend to bring hundred but why you bring one hundred i am cheap man cheaper better cannot word  i am not going to buy anything much there because got there enough already t shirts all these are in what i word to t shirts and then with the  word  of course you can go the top take a tut tut or you want to hire a train or you can spend the whole day at town or just do they have durians there oh yes i don't know whether the season is on too cashews nuts i heard yeah lay boon view we are passing by a cashew nut factory hopefully that is the itinerary by our agency we have not visited our agency at all you know don't know what is going on so call blind lead blind how do you how do you come across this pardon how did you get to know about this your friendly newspaper man oh newspaper only two or three agencies having this promotion four days three night right but of course it is the accommodation that is the diff different four star and you know five miles ahead programme miles ahead programme what is it about every hundred dollars you charge to your your card uhvisa card you will be given one travel point so all you need is to just clear this travel point the least is seven travel points that gives you an whole list of discount you know uh the one that i am very interested is the one at do you pronounce as bifort or what sentosa bifort hotel so beaufort hotel is it ya for me seventy odd dollars hundred can't remember the actual but it was more than seventy per cent discount ah ha if you were to go the market you are paying something like three hundred plus but with thirty points first thing you pay hundred and seven seventy odd so it is similar to the frequent fly programme on the airline uh but i thought you can exchange it for an air ticket but in the hotel i will make it word  fifty per cent fifty per cent according to him is seven seventy per cent you know it is a suite ah ah a suite good and the just look at they are going to advertise very aggressively because this is this is a very good programme i think personally you can also get the one of free return ticket to klat seventy seventy nine dollar or so at qantas airline with seven dollars pointers in it only for six months this programme that is within this six months you must charge lah but you can redeem the gift travel till till nineteen ninety four loy you should say something lah ask about

Singapore	okay how concept plan done which concept plan the one with theresa  word give me the end of the week end of the week i told her to give me just a a very rough storyboard oh we still looking at the rough storyboard were we no no no no  word  ya ah but starting to be word  i think because she just she just handled her her scripted for theatreworks it's gonna be put up in june ah ha did i tell you word  but i know she's doing a play lah so she very very stress she she took part in that in that uh writer's ya thing right that's correct thing and suddenly that word to the whole that he wanted her to do yours the thing in june ya because ah prof said that when he comes back he wants to do when is he coming back a write-up itself when is he coming back he said end of the month can ya and oh ya i was so stress i'm not going to get my pay this month very irritated no lah really when you you leave they it takes because they take sometime to clear all your i didn't know your account i didn't know because you see when you leave right they have to check with all the departments ya lah to see whether you have any outstanding bills or not and if you have then they clear the bills with your money first that's why then whatever remains it's then forwarded to you lah i word  and good luck to it can get all your outside stuff right not yet they don't pay you so soon right that's right but i'm going to chase them lah now chase now you're behind schedule you know  word  sixteen around sixteen one suppose to have production meeting and all that but uhm i'm thinking of asking uh has have all the the cast been notice notified no don't know yet what that's why i mean like in-a-chord all this sure in-a-chord knows about it but they see patrick can't confirm with me whether they they can take part or not because he has not been able to contact everyone in the group i saw this uh the angmohish-looking guy what's his name simon or andrew or something like that quite dark is it no no no no that's cecil  word uh cecil the other man the fair one angmohish-looking guy angmohish ya he seems uh tanner tanner ah andrew simon either one of them andrew andrew right okay andrew i saw him the other day but outside lah no patrick wants to do uhm he feels that in-a- chord will like to come back and and and help what's patrick doing now just finished what his honours oh ya lang right ya so he's waiting for results lah oh ya word  wednesday i told the dancers to come at eight thirty good can uh i don't i i word  are you going to bring lights or not lamps and all that ya can we uh we must get it ready before and word  because so far shao ann hasn't come in and told me what he wants no i think shao ann shao ann came here with word you i know i was here then he came in and sat down then i thought he was like word uh casual visit sit down because we tried to get him we couldn't get him was so angry is it he was there then he said i'm supposed to meet zaini at twelve i said what have to go and check out the rehearsal i said they have already left what i i i distinctly remember you telling me that you going straight to the jc and then  word  coming in later or something like that right ya so i told him that your already left then he like no no no no zaini told me twelve o'clock they would have call me and inform me i said okay we we did he came  word  late or not eleven so you were late is it eleven-thirty then he waited till twelve you didn't show up twelve-thirty word  then in the end he went for lunch uh you went to lunch with him ya aiyo then he decided to go back home word  just simple lighting lah ya i told him the only elaborate ones where he requires to have some kind of shadow effect is your agreement right then all the others we can just make do with whatever lights they have ya so he said okay even if i mean worse come to worse just me a full ya lah just just a full illuminate the place ya no lah i think it'll go to be very simple jj doesn't have uhm elaborate dimmer system when lights no school has that none of the schools have that none but aj is is okay because some schools you can't get access to go the other side of the stage you know oh jj it's impossible that's why i don't want to go down quite good know ha window town is it ya they have uh back passage ah outram stage very good  word space and word  outram's outram stage has got like kallang theatre size ah deep very deep can go round ya it's very nice and the it's dark you see because the windows all covered so you can do all sort of things it's like auditorium lights are a bit primitive lah but at least you can you still have they have a dimmer system also they don't but they got cd player and all i mean sound sound wise is good but i think even if they don't have the dimmer system at least can add lights and have a difference to it rather than the other school halls where the windows are all so bright and you can't word  the lights won't have any effects lah ya especially it's a school-hall it's very bright even if you switch off the lights in fact uh if if the place is very bright i rather not use lights i mean coloured lights just use the the normal one ya it looks better because i think for word these these colours will probably not work as well as say red or yellow it be it appear too diffuse  word  you didn't read your article ah i didn't i have not people just told me about it the article was quite good actually is it yeah what did it say very well written at at times it was i didn't meet her know confusing word  you didn't ah then she just got most of the info from victorian and the and then she she spoke to me on the phone for about about five five ten minutes because it's interesting the the lead article right uh when you started out the article they had this statement saying that uh you know zaini word  bah bah and then left a a regular paying job oh like that devote his time to dance that that angle is it okay so it started out like that but then after that it went all the way that you are the artistic  word and all administrative word  assistant coordinating the nus dance ensemble and word  and they put that is it okay they put all that and then uh if word he said he what he abandon his dream to become a teacher oh god really ah ya abandon his dream to become a teacher or whatever uh to devote his time uh you know because his love for art uh for dance over rule everything else that kind of thing okay  word so that went that then towards the end he said that uh if you if you ever uh know you talk about that you you you did your degree right uh uh and the he said you had so no one can grudge you on the fact you're not studying lah word  oh oh neglect your education and all that and the that if you were to decide to leave and you've a degree what you're doing now you can always fall back on your degree and on teaching with with say word lah she said that ah ya but then i was thinking that moe may not find that very very flattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then you fall back on teaching  word  when i saw that i saw that that line i said is this word okay good lah not not too bad that that one line uh if i was moe and interview oh i see go and tell to moe lah you got no choice okay you want you take ya  word  there are other fish in the sea you know but i haven't got my interview you know actually uhm but you want to teach right that's the thing you see they may consider they may even offer you a position in in in ntu or nie to say take care of dance that means you join the ministry and dance like inspector for dance kind of thing then you go around the schools and things i wouldn't mind if you like uh maybe you should explore that area rather than go into teaching because i tell you uh you may enjoy teaching very much now but whether you really want to start teaching geography have you tried have you have you prepared this speech to me before word no no no that's why you're so hesistant about telling me this no i've i've told i've mentioned this to you before what but you never told me about the alternative is it about this inspector of dance no that one word  i was just thinking about it for sometime my cousin is the inspector of music yeah you see they have these positions right so in the past what they did was they just uh kind of promoted teachers who were in charge of dance or music or whatever and then just upgraded them usually senior inspectors for music and are word extracurricular activity or whatever they call them ya word  takes care of dance as well you see uh then usually they're neither dance dancers and so  word  but they they usually started on teachers uh they were they ya they become teachers first but then moe also have a scheme where they bring in professionals that come in you know directly and then teach dance like in in uh ntu they and damn tiring to teach dance you know i find i don't know lah i find need it could be very tiring i find it very one thing about me uh i have to do sideline i cannot i i'm not a one track kind of person  word no that's why what i meant was that uhm if you you want dance to in a sense uh complement what what i do what you do right rather than it being the main thing  word  but then you find that uh i don't know lah i i've seen a lot of people who've gone into teaching and then find that they can spare time later to do dance or whatever you find that it drains you so much that you will not benefit  word  ya it's true but i mean idealistically speaking i just want to get money and and studying dance somewhere that's idealistically and and like not even wanting to come back and work and hold some kind of responsible position i i great good lah but wish but that's not my primary concern right now i mean like you never you would never consider going say joining say sdt or it's very word lifestyle if i come out  but i heard that they were expanding themselves ya but if i come in i i don't like to come in because i'm i'm not a technical dancer but i'm a dancer- ideas word  so i you know so i rather work on my own word with experiments ya and create something so i don't know whether whether i'll call myself a choreographer first or a dancer first but the thing i wanna call myself i don't know i word  i don't know what you call it lah but i i like i find my greatest joy uhm sharing whatever things i have with others word which is actually teaching 
Singapore	peck chuan uh ya so what's your comment about tomorrow's meeting tomorrow ah ah tomorrow we're having our staff meeting and i hope dr teo can uh let us know our future direction clearer because uhm i think we're thinking of moving into a lot of new areas but uhm we must have a clear direction and clear commitment from the management otherwise is a bit difficult for people like us at the bottom so uhm is is the restructuring of the organisation affecting you anyway uhm ya talking about this restructuring actually i haven't gone through the the the whole structure what's it's going to be like because this morning i don't have time to read the thing and the last meeting i wasn't there but from what i know is for our team uhm we won't be affected that much because you know next time when our our side merge with your your team ya we're going to merge right in july uhm and then i think some for our side our people uh will be mainly doing the the back back end work uh whereas talking to users would be more from your your side and i i word  you mean that kind of thing including the three major departments which three like bursar's and so on ya ya ya we'll be the frontline ya for all all the word  i i i'm not so sure exactly how they're going to uh divide the work lah but from what i know it's uhm uhm people like diane myself shuefen they all will be doing development work and then when users have problem they won't call us directly they will call i don't know who from your side would be but i think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem they call you you mean you mean normal problem what i'm referring to is those uhm as i said uh the accounting system you know ya so if if there is any of uh any problems that belongs to say say a particular application ah they will still go to the frontline people and if those people cannot solve it then they will channel back to the back up people oh i see so because uh if say right now uh if the user say our user the account user they they printer got problem they will still call us you know uhm uhm uhm but next time this one should be solved by the word what you mean is that uhm we'll sort of act as a buffer uh the interface uh solve the the minor minor problems we'll solve but when it comes to a more the more specialised programmes we'll look you'll look into that ya i think for you guys uh i think you'll still be involved in some development work lah but i think most of the time you're attending to user i hope not because it's supposed to be twenty twenty per cent the most ha am i right and uh i think we'll be also involved development work ah for me is uh postgrad schools ya and that's already a lot of maintenance actually you expect to get other project ya ya in fact at the moment only one school is is having the the system running so there there are three more actually don't know when the  word  hopefully new the s q l d s thing that you're working on ha what s q l d s i thought i thought i thought you have to do some s q l work uhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it ah of course that is that's where all the records are stored all these while you're working on this system lah yes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and manipulates the data in the database by the way uh weiying is supposed to back me up who weiying from your group weiyan uh ah weiyan ya suppose to she's suppose to uhm back me up in this system uh ya which is a surprise to me since when ha i mean it's going to start in july or so oh oh so she's going to be my back up for this thing oh you're the main one that's why i was wondering is is that what's considered as merging you know between the two groups that you know backing up each other that kind of thing funny thing her system and i won't think of it as a front line her her her system of taking over then she go and assist it's just like physically uh changing office now job wise also change because actually uh you know i'm also working on this exam mark entry system right actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah and then a william took over and now i was ask to look into it further and further you mean enhancement ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah why because ah because we're facing a lot of problems we our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all over the campus and then one once they call up complain that there's a problem we can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time so we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time lah so once during this period once a year that sort of thing ya and uh and also for me during this period uh is the the account section they're having their year-end closing so it's a lot of work at us at the same time so this one got to look into it lah i'm currently looking into ways to improve and uh cut down on the the travelling improving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut completely new you know language or whatever or i don't know my boss was saying look into client server solution pos that's one possibility ah but i don't think uhm this justifies because this it's too expensive is going to take up too much time i rather you know during uh this period you can do a bit of walking around rather than word   word users uh ya word users than to spend a months to redevelop to whole thing but then if you redevelop it'll be let me think in the long run it'll be beneficial to everyone yes ya but the thing is when you rewrite probably five years later you've got to revamp the whole thing again so the thing is whether spending this six months is is worth or not for this next five months ah sorry five years and during these five years is not you're not using it everyday you're only using it during the exam period but then you must see that uhm how about personally for saying to think that is beneficial to you i mean you'll be learning a lot of new things ya i think you find it quite interesting uhm ya uh i was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning platform that's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm we need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out we can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah so uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then i think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better ah so so let's talk about more your work my my work uh uh at the moment i'm i'm doing of maintenance work and looking into development of uh uh some of the subsystem in addition to this assistance system maintenance and uhm it still requires a lot of enhancement and uh it seems that the system i mean the department is very dynamic they change things uh now and then you see with new subjects you see with new subjects and so on coming in so that requires a lot of changes to the system and that keeps me very busy ya and on top of that you still got to support what word perfect uhm those are normal uh user supports lah located a a couple faculties to take i mean to take care of all the secretaries and so on for the o a system and general pc problem actually uh actually is quite interesting and quite good to have exposure to to do some uhm pc work uh if it is just purely mainframe then it's quite boring at times uh quite true because mainframe seems that there are much more restrictions than pcs ya and actually now i'm also i'm looking into some uhm uhm tax retrieval and document management system is it ya it's actually for the personnel department you know they have a lot of minutes they keep a lot of minutes for the senate meetings i think at the moment there is a existing uh system as what you describe uh you mean used by the using status word  oh do they consider that no no we have to look into alternative solution we're not you mean exclusive of that ya ya ya uhm i mean since it's already there why not to take a look at it and see whether it it you know it's useful for your department i'm i'm not quite sure why we're not going to use that probably because the support for it has uh uh is not there anymore i'm i'm not very sure it's still there is it i'm supporting it no no no i mean vendor support oh vendor support hah uh ya i'm not too sure about that maybe there's no more upgrade anymore or what i'm not so sure you mean it's a dead ya ya but it's working lah future enhancement probably there isn't any oh i see so you're looking into vendor word  that is growing we're looking into pc solutions is that a pc based or mainframe based mainframe ya we're looking more into the pc but pc i thought you have uhm stoage limitations oh nowadays pc can support up to quite uhm but talk about just large capacity personnel department is okay how about in future to use for other departments uhm no just actually even in personnel also the requirement can be very very high because you're talking about storing uhm uhm all documents you know belonging to each staff belonging to student so when you apply for a job and then your resume your application form everything this probably got to be stored electronically lah so by scanning in as an image and uh uh storing on uhm secondary storage devise like what like what cd-rom optical disc optical disc ya it's something called optical judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive so currently we are just looking into it lah so what's the chances how's the chance like uh with that like of budget we have i think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah we're just looking into the word feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet and also the user side has not identified exactly what should be  word archive into into uh uh computerised system so that's why i these days i have to call up a lot of vendor  i got a lot of meeting go for a lot of seminars is for this purpose which is quite interesting lah oh oh oh i thought all the while is current server current server also that one is looking into uh oracle database diane and myself lah i thought it's informix previously we're looking at informix and oracle plus some hardware but uhm you know there's this task force current server task force so they delegate the work lah so actually we're not in the task force but i don't why i got this got to do this also diane and myself we got task to look into oracle interesting uh seems like we have talked quite a lot already uh i was thinking of uh we're talking about the just now you mentioned about uhm optical disk is it there are other alternatives right other than optical disk i think uhm there's this what any other alternatives since you said it was expensive actually uhm if you talk about if optical disk has very very high storage capacity if you talk about cost per bit ah per bit of storage ah optical disk is definitely cheaper than other means like magnetic tapes uh or not uh sorry magnetic disc our our normal uhm hard disk uhm but the initial cost is high yes uhm again in the long run is is cheaper actually ya because you can store a lot more so it really depends on how much data you have lah whether you real it's really necessary to get correct optical disk ya so it's for for example uhm well government department for example our inland revenue you collect so many forms right if you were to keep them you need a big warehouse so and if it catch fire that's it ya ya and you cannot duplicate 
Singapore	that means you wrote in first is it and then they short list those people for the test that's right i i heard on the radio and then they short list you for in voice test because thanks uncle that means you went through the voice test already so this is the next stage ya the voice test is very fun the voice test very fun that means after this no more lah two rounds i think if you get short listed again you go for the interview uh that's right that's right ya because for the nus one i went for the written test as well so terrible lah they say you are short listed for english test so you go you write a essay and a and a and a formal letter to invite mr x to come here for a stress management workshop something like that uh because it's uh administrative assistant for extra department of extra-mural studies just like you know like outside courses ya ya those are extra-mural lor so i i didn't know what's extra-mural i just know that i'm qualified for it then i applied it's not easy uh i tell you so how i mean at least i'm short listed for interviews so it's not bad ya at least you've a chance you see uhm ya i've got a friend uh i don't know how many companies she wrote into you know and then not one interview ya lor yet the thing is that i don't have enough interviews but what what is her qualification uh just a bachelor degree ya ya lor honours is nothing unless you you you can get a job then you earn a bit more something like that i'm not sure but you start with a higher pay start with a higher pay but for sbc if you want to go into the executive post uh you must have honours at least only government is like that ya actually i don't i don't think there is a difference ah honestly just spend one more year uh so but this one is radio presenter i didn't know you have to go through test for this kind of stuff i i thought just go for interview i mean from there they can judge what but at least voice test they must hear you over the ya lah  word i'm sort of expected a voice test but written test like word  for my friend she just she was just applying for programmer you know like you slot in programmes and then you've to go a test also they have english one and chinese one i should have asked for chinese and english then i try which one i get in because like this kind of of stuff uh radio is mainly research students gone through a degree uh and honours you've got sufficient skills no lah i've no general knowledge ya it's the general knowledge that that see they may interview you on that but not a written test but actual but written test on general knowledge what i just don't know you know because normally i read english newspaper also if when i do read ya then these few days oh you don't read the chinese as well these few days i read chinese lah i can't stand it because a lot of things we learn in english ya you do you don't you take for granted ya and when it comes to chinese you just you sometimes it just hits you oh no what is it called like if you ask me what is the ivu i also don't know what is it called so it's quite bad why don't you try for the english department i didn't try lah you write into i think it's it'll be much easier you know chinese is like but i thought chinese it's easier is easier for me ah it is easier is it for me to talk in chinese you know uh really well in a way but not not ya lah my my general knowledge is just terrible lah oh because at home you speak mandarin right uhm ya all of you well one or two of us in english lah then mix here and there alright even speaking to each other in your your siblings in mandarin ya uh i think my main killer was the general knowledge only one out of so many or one or two i don't know aye my is just as bad you know ya i have no general knowledge you know is like ya so terrible even when i try to read papers ah i don't i don't remember what i read ya you just read and read and ya i really force myself to read and then okay imagine you have to write out what you want to interview them and then you have to write uhm come up with intelligent questions otherwise it'll be like oh no and these people are big shots you know ya  word if you ask them what will they think of you so entertainment programme i wasn't expecting things like that because entertainment is so i know quite a bit of about those who is who and whatever and all the gossips ya gossips very good thank god i resitted for the test and then ask me this kind of thing i suppose they expect you to reach a certain standard ya even in uh uhm right when i did my radio programme ah uhm for the beginners uh of course you do things like read you know a story or things like that but when they went on to advance uh you can't do those entertainment programmes you know like my friend you know you've got to do an academic subject ya so he he majored in econs also so he did on econs that means on air you know nearly go on air every week ya it's just those ca things right ya but he loves econs so it's oh that's fine ya he read papers get the all the cut outs and then analyse and then over the radio he presents i don't mind doing some classical music sort of thing you know don't ask me to do this i hate it i mean when you don't have the interest it's very difficult to go in ya and then you're not graded for it ya so it's all self-discipline i know lah it's something i should know can't blame anyone you can go into research what sbc like what you know like uhm current affairs or you know uhm feedback that kind of thing as a researcher i think it's interesting i don't know if they want me no you apply for it lah honours grad honours also you go to you go and get the uhm forms i think i i still have i still have i have one extra and they have got all the different departments no but you're only suppose to write in when they advertise for it can't you just write in like that guess word they what is fated unless you know somebody in there go straight ah then you you have oh we need someone someone just resigned and all you don't wait until the papers come out who resign martin soong resign who resign i know that guy ya not easy uh that time i was i went for a interview with sbc i think it was uh no really you got ya no written test ah no there was just interview i think it was uh what post was it uh some executive i think uhm ya some executive i think written uh so they ask you whether you are interested you know as an editor and that kind of stuff in sbc so no i mean i give my views because they say sometimes they they look at my resume and then you know they say you're very involved in church work but sometimes sundays you may need to come back to work so you can't lah so i said no lah in that case you know uhm ya i don't know hopefully i just in nus that'll be good boring job lah hey he is in nus who chris researcher ya i know r and d but but but uhm ya so what the thing is they were asking for researchers but uhm why ah did i have to write there's something that i just can't be bothered to write so what's that uhm i think i have to hand in something that to show our research or something then also three referees that can commend on your research ability as well oh that means that will have to be academics ya all the academics from australia and i only have maximum two 'cause our ours our department is so small unless i go to the french department which i don't think they should be able to commend on my research ability because what about your undergrad tutors undergrad loh ya because linguistics is very small department uhm they teach all level uhm aye are we going to start or what i don't know we are still waiting for angela she's not here she's working as i think estate real estate or something like that oh ya very word  ah it's very tough don't mind go and do rental it's easier you want to try to sell a house is so difficult it is you know ya but then you you have everything is comes in millions of dollars but i don't know what uh position she is holding whether is she a sales or ya i don't know so she wrote in i don't know i don't really know how she got the job but she was thinking of going into teaching or something ya that's what i heard ya but i think her parents uh doesn't encourage that uh her parents are teachers ya every time i go for those government interviews a lot of them ask me why don't i go into teaching oh because we have got that's why i was thinking if i really want to go into teaching i would have gone i don't need to go into teaching as well then i get very then the pub people were were quite mean i had an interview last friday pub ya they they say why you did so badly for your 'a' levels uhm what what else uhm something lah is it because of i said uh because i was i wasn't very interested in what i was doing and and i was quite involved in my word  you were in science is it yes oh and i did science in in 'o' level as well lah i see but then at that time i wanted to go away i just can't be but i didn't say things like that and then he said oh is it because of puppy love it's like i was so because what puppy love i mean how can you say word  how can you ask things like that it's so how can it ya it's very personal i don't think what what has to go it doesn't have and he was very patronising the way he asked it i mean if you do it as a joke i can accept it ya but the way he did it was very okay never mind then he he say but but uhm but you did well when you do science and what whatever you know i was very i said i just said definitely not word  because i wasn't ya that was the truth because i just wanna go away then sometimes these people uh terrible you know i mean i'm here to apply for a job you're not ya creating me for i'm not trying to get a scholarship from you ya so i don't think they have a right to i should have just blasted them but i just didn't 
Singapore	she confided in me you know she even said like i don't know whether i am going to enjoy tonight's dinner i think she was kind of feeling a little bit apprehensive about meeting her very popular predecessor uhm oh but it turned out all right in the end because maureen in her usual manner was like uhm full of life uhm full of electricity oh i see oh you mean you really had her doubts ah ya ya but uhm that's what she said i don't know whether i would enjoy tonight's dinner that was precisely why i didn't turn up actually really yes i didn't want to word  because you were afraid of meeting maureen not maureen like i i the point was that i i wasn't sure i would enjoy the dinner because i didn't want to sit in the same at the table as madame oh i got really oh she was pissed off ya she was quite pleasantly charming that evening which was surprising like so out of character but uhm ya yvonne was still here at that time and she she wasn't really invited oh oh and she said i wouldn't even go if they paid me a million bucks so i was beginning to wonder when what what would i be doing there i wouldn't even enjoy myself so that's why i decided to oh but you had every right to be there because it was supposed to be like in celebration of uh the new year's dinner or no no no uhm who's farewell dinner was that tony tan's farewell dinner tony tan ya ya it was supposed to well celebrate all the good work that we have done not really celebrate but it was a thank you dinner for all of us so you had every right to be there more so than me than mabel than ellice it was it was mabel and and sunstroke i didn't do anything for tony tan oh okay and then i like and how was i to know that would that would be like a birthday thing added to it whose birthday was it it's mine oh so then later on later on they they they gave the cake to maureen oh did they give the cake to maureen no it was brought back to the office no no ya but they they wheeled the thing to maureen the trolley oh oh doreen ya doreen sounded so much like maureen ya hang on a minute hello uh ya get back to you okay bye who was that uh den dennis lah oh checking on you i don't know he was quite cheesed off about that that talk that i had with that gentleman yesterday what gentleman was that the one that you said that you insisted was wearing a wig oh really uhm but dennis shouldn't be jealous of every man you speak to especially as this one is like uh golden opportunity for you ya but he with the golden hair uhm the way you put it golden opportunity now the thing is uhm he just is and uhm he but then i side-track and console him by saying that oh don't worry about me echon word says he looks fuuny you know even she wasn't impressed at all and she was insist she insisted that he was wearing a wig you can't for the life of him be real you know real hair so he said uh okay maybe there is something in the way you describe all these men to him maybe no all i could that's why he's always so jealous all i could have to say is he's a male and okay that's it out comes the horns and the green shade and what not oh is it all right if he were to speak to females it's okay it's perfect okay right ah he reckons that i am a dangerous person oh i suppose like really like maybe i suppose if he finds it difficult to resist you he probably believes that all men feel this way what a joke what a real joke no i don't think that's the case i think he is just plain jealous spot word  do you know that yesterday anyway uh men are so unreasonable you know definitely i mean they're like they are still living in the stone age uhm they have double standards uhm uhm then what else can we think of ya i must similar problems with my boyfriend too really i thought he was so cool word  so that's why his friends keep tabs on you ah well he thinks i am damn helpless uh he probably is not aware that i am so much more intelligent than him in every way ah how does he know i am not pretending to be helpless just to make him feel good that's why i tell you men are so damn stupid no oh ya that's what i go through i always play the like fragile dame damsel in distress and he that's what that was the term that he used for to describe me fragile oh that's exactly the term that my boyfriend uses to describe me too really oh yes i mean you find it hard to believe right knowing me that's why that's why they don't know what they're talking about you know they're just so stupid fragile fragile ah okay uhm well i suppose like uhm they have this uhm sort of believe dreams that they want their women to be this way they want their women to be that way you know and they always want to play hero they want to be the hero oh ya so tough but in my case he likes it that i am independent and and he wishes you to be more independent than you already are or to show him no that you are more independent than what you are showing him now actually he allows me to be independent because i am supposed to be on home ground so i cannot go round right being on home ground gee what a weird way of thinking i think that that's where you can go wrong definitely wrong because you are more familiar with the territory uhm that's right and you can be up to more nonsense than ya true if you're on foreign ground ya because this is your territory quite true but anyway what he doesn't know doesn't wouldn't hurt him right uhm no his rationale is that well i'm in home ground so i can be allowed a lot more freedom but later on when we move away and i am in a strange land than i think he would sort of keep uh closer tabs ya that's right really i think so so no wonder you were saying is like bye bye to freedom in more ways than one no he probably thinks that uhm that you know i'll behave myself when i am here because uhm well but you know over there i might not behave myself so much oh is her right i think he's wrong i'll probably behave myself there anyway i don't have time to go around ya you'll probably be so busy and caught up with your work uhm okay lah let's not talk about men they're such boring subjects ya but you kind of live with them you can't live without them oh that's what they say about us too right who said that uh i seem to remember hearing these words just uh a few days ago were you the one who said it nope not me who told me the same thing it's a common phrase so you know oh but someone one said it and in this context too when we're talking about men no that person was talking about women oh and he was saying like you can't live with them and you can't live without them he was referring to women now who was it uh ah well i guess that's my boyfriend's right i have too many boy-friends can't remember i don't know who tells me what uhm okay probably okay let's get back to our office politics here you know that's more interesting so what do you think will happen now if uhm our friend maureen comes back oh but she'll be so much it it'll be so much if she comes back and when i'm still around but not likely to be i suppose probably not but uhm well i heard from somebody that she actually she she actually stepped on a few toes while she was here she steps on her toes oh and but but she is a great favourite with the boss ya but like if she step on her toes than why the hell does she we're all excreted to oh well i think she has been specifically instructed by the man himself to say that we're so happy to hear that you're coming back you know and all that uh i tell you that woman can be so double faced you know probably well are you going out to lunch uh i had my lunch uhm and actually i had a very heavy lunch had potatoes and had salad i where potato kentucky fried chicken you know oh you went out the soft potato that whipped potato you went out no actually it was yesterday's one i couldn't finish it i couldn't eat it at all in the fridge oh you're ribbons are quite nice yap so you just tie actually uhm how much did it cost you buy these ribbons uhm if you get a ready made one it's sixty cents but if you get the whole roll like you know something like this it's two bucks oh ya then you can make i suppose it's more economical ya what it's so troublesome i mean i did one to show jenny jenny's daughter how to do it and that was it i never expected her to like come back and say please ask me to make another one uhm uh so well hack 'cause i'm not doing anything anyway i told ellice very flatly i have lost the desire to work and then what happens now i don't know i just wait and see whether that guy's offer comes through if it does i'll be so glad to go away oh where is her now he's somewhere in singapore he'll be here for the next couple of days and after that he's going back to sydney oh and so i don't know ha has he got your address he may write to you from there he's going to fax me from sydney would it be wise so i mean people would be able to read you know your letters uhm maybe he should write to you instead of faxing well i gave him the card my card here and i i could always get in touch with him before i leave so uhm i hope well anyway even after you leave and you expect faxes i can take them for you and pass it to you so no problem okay no no i not that worried 'cause jenny's the one closest to the fax so she's on the look out oh ya that's right you know so that's okay you know uhm but make sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands because you'll never know i know i know our bosses are like dead curious i think because like both of them saw me with him and if and they were pretty curious judging from the expressions because like miss ng walking up and down three times and even when he was in my room she like went to and fro mabel's room a couple of times and each time non fail she look in and sakuma was passing like walking up and down like for no apparent reason  and of all things he was driving up the road when we were walking down 
Singapore	my sister was trying to teach him to read his alphabets the three year old one ah the three year old one he is like very slow but he can recognise places and all that you know just that when you teach him uh he doesn't want to repeat after you so she got so she got so mad i think you can't force them ya you can't force them my kids also when i try to read to them they will hold the book and bite the book ya run away with the book ya because i think at this time the attention span is very short ya very short i think different lah because i remember my first nephew ah who's now in the poly already ah so uhm i think word of his age he would've been able to listen to stories you know i tell him stories and then he would be interested but uh this boy quite not so interested one he is interested in cars and he likes car he will play with his cars all the time my kids love balls every time they go to ball ball ball ball then they scream until you buy for them oh so now what we do is we keep a pack of balloons in the bag so when they scream for ball we give them one balloon ya but it's not very good lah to give in to them all the time then they will they will think that you know ya especially if you bring them shopping then they start screaming it'll be terrible actually my friend told me it's not very good to buy things in front of them if they want it later on you come back to buy if you buy on the spot they get the idea that whatever they want you buy ya but i think most singaporean kids are spoilt because now they only have two or three only actually it's very very tiring looking after kids ya i must have aged a lot you know giving birth look but at least once they grow up you you are free lah ya more relaxed uh i think one thing good about twins is that they can play together you see ya so now when i see them sometimes one hug the other or what give them two biscuits they will give one to the one you feel quite nice share ah share you see i think they like to call each other name you know refer to each other their own code you know very funny oh like timothy uh jeremy will call him ti don't know why you know ti ti so funny ah then the other one call the other one will call jeremy xie because jeremy is yenxie you see oh somehow he call him xie oh so when you give him their pacifier they know which one is theirs 'cause different shapes oh so if you give him jeremy's one he will say xie xie xie xie so cute ya but you can you can are they i mean can they be distinguished or not of course you would know lah that the mother most of the time to us they look quite different but somedays uh suddenly they would very much the same lah oh but jeremy has a mole quite high up here lah oh so you can recognise it at first when they had no mole we have to tie things to their legs lah because the hospital tied things you see oh i see so we just kept that on just to make sure we don't oh they must me really identical ah to us they look not so much the same when they were younger yes lah then about four months they uh jeremy had a mole oh so that was uh much better ya but now when you look at the photographs some photographs cannot see the mole lah we can't tell oh at that time uh we could tell you know ya for one of my sister who doesn't come so often she can't tell ya i think recently after taking no pay leave uh you become hot tempered oh when you are with them scream scream when you are with them all the time ya because kids are like that you ask them not to climb they will climb ya so now especially at a certain age you know they'll start climbing you got to jagar them lah ya because they don't know what is dangerous you know ya i think when they're about uhm my friend told me eighteen months then that time okay because eighteen months they supposedly they can understand you and all that but i think should be around two to three i think different stages they have different types of problems ya that's true just like my niece and nep my niece and my nephews they sort of they sort of grew up in my home my eldest nephew my mother sort of took care of him for about um two over years uh uh because my sister-in-law was working full-time so quite difficult lah for them by the time they come home they had a baby-sitter and they come back about eight something then haven't cook and all that you know so my mother said okay lah come and you know she'll look after and he sort of practically grew up and he was the first grandchild so very pampered you know and uh then after that the others they sort of maybe the others didn't stay as long as this eldest one you see then i this one my this present one the three year old one my sister comes practically every day so we see him all the time this boy sort of grew up in this house you know so i mean at least if when they come in when they come over they've more of us lah my mother and all that me my brother you know so you don't get only one if you're faced with one kid you'll die man the whole day so sort of like not really take turns lah the child also got other people to run to you know and play with actually for them especially at the young age interaction with other people is very important ya but sometimes you can't sort of draw the line you know i mean like you want them to be sociable yet they don't want them to be too sociable because they will go to strangers and you know they they don't i mean how to fear strangers they might just follow them ya but it's true lah at each stage there is problem then after they go to school you worry about their homework and all that ya that's right then they word  my other sister has two of them one is already in sec two this girl and then the boy is uh i think primary five or primary six i always get them mixed up she's always nagging them ya the school system is so competitive that's why you've got to make sure that they study and study ya then later you worry about them girlfriend boyfriend ya lah then after that their work ya throughout your life you're worrying even they settle their family ya then settle down i think you're forever worry worry ya i mean i think when they have kids and then when their kids get ill ah ya then you worry about the kids about the child i suppose that's part of life lah ya but i suppose if he can take it deeply then it's okay no lah i don't think you think so far ahead one lah you just when it comes along then one at a time and that's enough lah ya but you never thought that you have twins lah you didn't know lah or or you you knew at six weeks i knew oh you were more or less prepared lah ya ya but if if not prepare it'll be a real shock ah ya i mean all along i thought it'll be nice to have twins lah think my brother told me it's fat hopes because of the low low it doesn't run in the family ya i remember i told him to record every anything if possible then it turned out it's true ya i suppose in a way it's quite nice lah you know to bring them up in one shot ya because then they will study together same level i mean initially i think the expenses will be more because we've to buy books and everything maybe but later on i think it's all right don't know whether it can be so like because like like uhm in my family the niece the nephews hand down lah all hand down i see because they all outgrow so quickly and then ya it's true you know  word rather than throw it away it's too good to throw away so it get rotated to cousins and  word  ya i think most people do that but my sister mary she loves buying clothes for them she insist on wearing the same clothes you know she keeps buying clothes for them i think most of their clothes they wear two three times only so many ah now my whole cupboard is packed i think twenty to thirty suits each wow then shoes they have so many pairs she like must match match them that's a waste lah because especially i mean you buy two sets then if you have another one you hope it's a girl lah then you can't really wear unless you sort of word ya  word i mean dressing them same same you know when they are young it's quite fun lah of course when they grow up they won't like to wear the same ya but one thing i think i mean i think you they've companionship you know but the book says you have to sort of uh try to let there be times when they're separate you know they need time to have their own space to grow what and also when they grow up of course inevitably there'll be sometimes when if they go to different schools or what you know so from young they should sort of know that there are sometimes when they are not together otherwise they will feel very insecure once the other one is not there when the other time when you were doing your exams you were still teaching right you had to right was it very stressful very stressful and especially this year because i had to go to a new school oh i was uh transfer out what school was that uh it's that kwan yang kwan yang guangyang never heard it's at bishan and it's yangzhong one of the very very lousy schools hah i don't know it's at bishan you know bishan do you live near there not so near lah but it's it's about ten minutes drive not bad not not not bad but it's very different from the previous school i was in i was from cedar you know that was a girl's school you see so i have no discipline easier to handle right no ya easier to handle no discipline problems just only once stream express then here we have normal stream normal stream you know and then it's mixed co-ed and the and there's discipline problems also so uhm i it was very difficult lah in in because you know new school new environment new adjustment and all that kind of thing but i don't know by the grace of god it's still uhm because it was it was quite and especially beginning of the year when did you join this  ha when did you join i only went in beginning of the year what oh january when school reopens january ya so then i also don't know whether how the school will take to the fact that i am doing this course and uh also that's why i mean i was actually at first i thought at first i thought the our exam would be uh uh you know originally our exam plans was what uh not not what it was foley actually told us it was something else lah so then when i got the exam timetable and then there was all these series of workshop on saturdays you know so i was thinking i better tell the principal lah because you know you can't take off like that so i told her lah i said i'm taking a course

still want to go to paris you know to paris so what are the places in england you are going to visit well i will be in london for a week and then hopefully uh i might break off and to paris for about four to five days and then after that i will go to scotland and then from scotland uh work my way down to london walk your way down work my way oh oh okay down to london and then i think that would probably use up all use up all my leave uh are you are you going alone or what no i am going with a an ex-colleague and her boyfriend aye uh so interesting the three of you of course who else so you are babysitter in a way uh no she is quite a a good traveller even though she is young but she is quite good suppose word to go with john and chong and company uh initially we were suppose to go back to the states but the whole gin gang but well slowly everybody start deciding not to go back to the states so choy peng wants to europe pat wants to go europe and then uh i have decided not to go back so the group starts dwindling uh so in the end i think chong and john also will not be going i i don't think they fancy the uh idea of travelling with a married couple yes and a kid too so anyway uh lai kwen will be going back soon is it when i heard is june the nineteen she will back but she will for her holidays then after that she will go back to continue but i thought you are suppose to go down to hawaii to meet her right that was our initial plan uh uhm but the thing is well i guess the attraction isn't there  word chor hoon will be back chor hoon will be coming from uh australia oh just nice uh during your holidays what about yourself uh where you going i will be baby-sitting the whole month how interesting yes you never go on leave uh i do but how to how to get out of singapore i mean so many obligations then got to stay finish finish my work but i think i want to take some days off uh go to sentosa or where go and go and you know let myself go and know relax there don't bother you know why don't you thought of going back to the states to oregon wanted to uh but so far away so expensive also what you are working for when i go back there i don't know anybody there what most pe most of my my friends would have graduated uh uh true go back to go back to visit my professors i think some of them are not there anymore aye uh for all you know you know all of them gone because i heard the last time oregon was cutting down on certain departments is it last time when i i went they have already cut down their p e department is already about gone oh really it is no longer a department by itself it is now the department with i don't know what the department uh i do miss oregon uh those apples apples cherries prunes prunes yes limes yes peaches yes the weather uh so so so you should go maybe it will do good for my skin uh uh why uh you you never had such problems when you are you are there  word the weather uh what to do when i come when when i came back here all these problems crop up uh i think is the stress maybe i should really take a break you know how to every time i want take a break something will crop up you know now i got to do baby-sitting you know for for two kids uh why why uh don't know uh so when you are setting up for the for your for england fifth i am leaving on the fifth before the end of this is may right uh i leaving on the fifth

what i am worried about you know jet lag uh most probably you will take a week to rest no i think i am quite used to it already after being uh after having gone to the states for two instance two times three times maybe i think i sort of got used to the i think this is one reason why i don't want to go on tour you know you get more tired when you come back home not only do you waste your money you come back you get tired some more you are going sentosa aye uh no rest at all i mean word where you go on uh i mean for that kind of tours that i go on i get tired because we all uh i know uh camp camp on on the slope of the hill when it is minus three degrees celsius rains in the mid of the night get my socks all wet that that you go and blame evelyn okay not i word backache boy i rather live in a motel uh and pay for the difference uh you uh and not adventurous at all uh maybe should go to do some mountain climbing like bukit timah uhm hill if you call that a mountain i have not been up there before you haven't i have not uh i still i should take really go there and take a good look uh i think why don't you become a tourist of singapore and then tour all the places of interest take mrt train from boon lay all the way to pasir ris maybe i should do some some aye the bukit timuh reserve is quite a nice place in that case i heard lots of mosquitoes too right don't know but the climb up there is tiring who is is saying about climbing i can always use the path what walk your way up it is still up climb word right we still have to go up you mean you can't drive up there i don't know i think only halfway is it  word i don't think you can go all the way up just half way and then you have to do the rest by climbing on foot anyway it is short uh the whole month of june doesn't doesn't sound long you know please uh you just go out of singapore to a foreign country okay uh i will go to penang uh well that that that might be good you know penang is quite a relaxing place also i can go and disturb someone there who beng choon uh oh he is he is from penang he is from penang what how about robert robert is from i think penang also i don't know i am not too sure

Singapore	aye now that you're leaving what did your boss say he'll never much one ah is he still giving you a lot of work to do no he doesn't bother but as usual my senior architect ya when somebody's leaving she make sure that every every minute is worthwhile who is the senior architect every minute is spent sufficiently who's the senior architect one spinster lah june says she is a real bitch why ha i don't know in fact she was telling me one night talking about her work mok and associates she said her she got to that we have a very terrible woman don't know lah don't know what she's trying to do who when she walk pass ha the whole atmosphere will be like so full of tension like that say word june or your boss no this girl this ah word  but june likes you a lot but of course who doesn't she says you are the only person there with a proper sense humour oh really but i always bitch her one you know always slime her she says you are fun to talk to but they all very tak class one she's very stress now you know oh dear because her plans is being a disapproved uhm disapproved ya the then re-draw so they have to submit fresh plans oh dear she's planning a country club is it kenneth suppose to be her case study for her pp know oh dear stress lah then how if reject then she wouldn't get her pp already lor can lah but it is like word   question why you treat it like dirt right why never comply this and that why take so long to comply so many extensions comply to what to fsb actually actually the other departments all cleared know except for this fire safety oh dear suit the client lah why don't want to provide this don't want to provide that and all that don't want but actually the the the architect  word  but the architect has the you know should convince them that this was things are required what but the fsb also very terrible they always come up with new requirement some submit ha oh this this thing not proper we've never comply either that or like they come up with new er regulation and then then no no like they they point out new mistakes kind of thing you know so unfair lah she must be utterly word  but she's appealing ya lah better to appeal 'cause it'll be ridiculous you know imagine you send the same drawings to the other departments and the other departments approve already i approve already what you send in for what get what i mean but for the sake of this main department right the building controller you have to submit to the other the other departments for for clearance quite terrible you know if i i would feel very stressed tan li liang ya before he left said i make sure this project will be left in shit ha he said i make sure this project will be left in shit and then and true enough so evil you know sabotage is so disgusting word  no it's not sabotage then then i ask her ask him you know did she know not did she know about all this you know right things didn't comply right ya did you tell june he said oh she should know what common sense what it's quite true lah actually but the fsb called uh highlighted to him but he didn't june ya so that is not fair you see think if i were june i'll be very angry with him but june was like fighting for the project ya like you know feel so jealous that he's taking care of the whole thing but was he taking care of the whole thing he ya ah ah then she just took you know help a small part of so she was like fighting for the project so well i guess now that you get what you want is difficult she cried you know when i saw the letter aye got such thing one uh disapprove notice of disapproval never seen before so what did they disapprove no safe no fire exit is it just say that you didn't comply to requirements lor so no because okay for the bcd's part lah okay they will say you have to get clearance from all this departments before you submit your plans ya by this by a specified date you see so if it you know once the due date is near you have to ask for extension right so they still can't get clearance from fsb because all the because already submit to bcd you have to get clearance from all the other departments but this bc this fsb still didn't give clearance you see ya so they have ask for extension five times already so eventually this bc they say cannot so long already must disapprove no more extension then how now re-draw everything from scratch can submit old plans lah but it is like submitting the old drawings same old thing just that you know i mean except for this er fsb new require i mean fsb requirement lah know what i mean she's very terrible lah then her face will be involve and all that right then delay the construction and then then delay the company will make loss then the temper temporary occupation permit also like delay people cannot make use of the building even though it is completed yes you mean the building completed already no right no but if they delay this process i see by the time the building com completed already but they still cannot get the top you know what i mean because each time it is like so unfair and so how she feel about it she's still very stressed of course today she too she took mc today oh dear is she going to marry you i don't know anyway she was always telling me about this cute representative of jcc jcc jurong country club ya the the one who represents lah very cute all this but married well too bad so when she said like know i must go to word  ocbc and jump down and all that oh okay you bet better have affair with then she say is better have affair with this peter first before you commit suicide then i said i think she got to resort to rape why that's so evil she's not that bad what but then again of course she's she's no miss universe lah not like you but of course miss venezuela who was the one who had the who was like like very big face lah oh oh oh betty is it ah ha anymore no no er in the miss universe the big face ar the latest one ya the one who's very one of the runners-up

Singapore	so i got some company so what we are gonna do is uh chris will just tape us having a nose rub ya nose rub this guy also want ha we are just gonna have a ordinary conversation ya ya marriage plans okay house and  research assistant's voice  is it on already okay we shouldn't have asked that we have scheduled for uh september of next year yep september next year that was our cat okay september of next year uh uh we want we probably start making we already made plans we got the hotel we don't have a church we haven't don't have a church uh uh i mean we thinking to do that don't think we hear word that our new church will be built on time we want to borrow your church mount carmel but there are three churches in that one building so our month the month that we pick is gonna be a really hot month bat yu you know so i i don't think it'll be it'll be available lah 'cause they told us that even if we apply any earlier your church members will come first in fact we have actually seen some of them what is that the caretaker ya and he said no word  it's a bit difficult lah the backup plan is our church our church lah the backup plan for our church is galilee hopefully if we really get them jason said maybe we have been relying on peng seng and uh sally to to on their experience lah oh okay building a house ya we got we got all their notes for their wedding from their wedding are you sure there are notes for the house our budget plans they are our key counsellors counsellors and they were our helpers when we are doing up our house we were their movers their cleaners packers uh accountants uh no drivers drivers  word choosers  word choosers yes yes yes that is our curtain also so actually uh ha what else later lah ya is it so simple don't understand how's it is coming up uh we actually uh they have just finished setting up their house uh they went through quite a trying tiring time doing that so they have a lot rich experience to share oh yes definitely like where to put the plugs which position when to start uh thinking of where you want to put all these stuff where the wiring will be you know little things like where the door bell is gonna be stuff like that that you never think about small little things which had a lot effect and how and how to get maximum mileage from a irresponsible contractor oh yes oh ya we manage to get also two thousand of compensation is it yesterday was the last right last time they come is it was it the last time no they will still come back and uh who was the fellow there yesterday still their contractor that is the same chap ah yes yes oh i see i see very happy so they are they are they're in their final process of getting their house ready lah basically it is almost ready it is fantastic you know that is if you know the lighting and everything ya ya it is very and the sofa it doesn't look out of place what ya it doesn't look green at all you know fits very well fits very very well research assistant's voice  just found your place we found a small kabi hole somewhere at yishun ya so everybody thinks it is too way out ya ya it is it is it's a it's a it is a cosy little place lah i mean you roll around you basically can reach one end of the skirting in the other with one roll one more to the other room so so it is quite it is quite a good place uh uh we are learning as we as we say lah learning a lot of things from peng seng and sally on how to set up the place how to to start with i think it is good to have a small home correct they may want to comfortable small home you know don't don't go for too big a home it is good we can't afford anyway ya you just get something you know which both of you are comfortable with you know happy that is the most important don't have to word  she is uh uh she is one of our sources of inspiration because there were a lot of forces against us what so small you know like a pig sty that is like oh we had felt really moody but my sister was one of those lah who agrees because she went through it you see she had a small house and she first met him and got married ya first home was about that small so first home was only one uh one bedroom one bedroom and one hall one living one dining one small little kitchenette yes actually actually for this kind of project it is very important for the family to rally around 'cause you are you are really going into the an unknown you see i mean you are doing this for the first time it is good to get support no you need support yes our family never gave moral support encouragement really know getting it it's like when somebody buys a house you will be happy right we were so sad you know we were so moody for the first weeks you know ya ya ya ya until we finally sink sank into the idea and got used to it you know and we get more and more confident and we went to visit we walked from the house till the m r t station it took only about less than ten minutes that really boosted our confidence it's like wow this is a great place and then after that we visited north point and there was such a nice cinema ya ya we would even used you honey word you look so wait till nicodemus grows up nephew six months old fantastic little kid chubby hello there wearing his rugby t-shirt ya ya so that was hilary word  but now we are quite happy now our model house is actually uh sally and peng seng's house they have already set up they have gone through everything our house would be their storage house too from now from now ya from now from now ya so they are charging us standard ware housing rates uhm for ya ya ya have that recorded too like a a french a dinner every month every quarter monthly hey hey you know what i found out there was that right after we had dinner that weekend the next weekend there were french dinners you know buffet you know elsewhere so upset where is that pan pacific one is pan pacific the other one was maybe it is weekdays again is it i don't know i don't think so word and it is really i think ko yak one i mean the spread at pan pacific was anyway in fact so ya i never go hilton again i think it is too backward still in the colonial thinking so you all are all set for your wedding no lah actually not not set still got got a lot of uh uh differences to iron out like what differences in our opinion for example operating styles in operating style more like it in a depth of uh uh memory rather lack of depth of lack of what is she pointed to herself when she said depth depth of and pointed to me when she said lack of for record purposes okay nicodemus hello there you must enjoy yourself while you prepare ya ya for your wedding really it is a life long actually where were don't make it a chore ya ya don't make it a chore this is a once in a life time you won't have to go through this another time you see and because the wedding itself ya ya you you usually won't want to and the wedding itself is only one day and it just passed by in the snap of the eye so quickly ya it is so fast you know but going on still got preparation and all that and in the end when you do it uh uh it looks doesn't it feel so official right or not they are not maybe not for yourself but i mean the logistics you have to worry about this worry about that in the end when you have it it is just like you are having a show you know ya ya i know then that is it is finished full stop that is it ya ya i think sometimes when you are so much like planning you got so many things to do in the end it is like like putting up a show ya part of it is for yourself part of it is for your friends and and ya for family a big part is for your family ya not everything is for yourself ya you know like that malay i was talking to my malay colleagues the concept you know it is that you leave everything to your family members they will plan the you know they plan the singing sessions they will plan the food you know they will invite friends and then everyone just comes along and sit down have a good time i mean their concept is disappeared from our chinese uh dictionary gone maybe it is become too organised ya lah too too much of a show already road show it is no longer for the wedding couple anymore ya it is more for everybody else and you have to do so many things you know just for everybody did you guys attend a ceremony it is very tiring in the states ah what they in the states they have a ceremony and then they come home and then in their backyard they have a barbeque or whatever oh ya we had one we attended ya we attended one once only is that what they do yes uh that was uh know this guy it was very casual he is a bit weird he has already got kids they had a re uh remarriage reconfirmation of their marriage they were already married and their daughters were their flower girls their sons were their page boy but they were married already legally married they were legally married so they wanted to have a church wedding church wed they didn't have a what you call it rededication or something church wedding they didn't have a celebration when they were younger you see when they first got married so now that it was about twenty years ago everything all settled and they have all their friends all you know social life all established they decided that they need a reconfirmation of their so funny ya not rededication but my friend told me that uh suet yee was telling me in uk it's very simple one you know she said her friend borrowed somebody's dress somebody's wedding gown i mean may not even wedding gown it's just a nice dress you know and then they got married after the church they they just went off nothing no buffet nothing you know ya it's very easy you know it's just a church wedding so simple and then i am saying it saves so much money you know i was like no i think i think it depends on the individuals uh you know perception of or what you want a wedding to be 
Singapore	so how was that day when you all made sushi it wasn't too bad aye tell me tell me tell me how to do it oh there were three of us that day no how do you do the sushi aye do you have this thing i know there was this kind of ya what do you call it that you roll the the the the mat the inchi word mat ya i had to buy it ya my friend bought that it's quite cheap ah about one something one seventy what else do you need to buy the the seaweed it's better to the big seaweed then you can cut nah cheaper what else the rice rice uh california rice can use california rice then whatever pickles right you put pickles you you use the chinese pickles lor chinese pickles what else but chinese pickles not long enough not long enough they have a long long one oh don't oh i think japanese they use the yellow type of japanese pickles no they have uh uh lettuce as well lettuce pickles and then how if we don't get the ingredients no no no we just chop slice it will do it's already small pieces so we slice lah we use the chye sim and all that uhm ya ya lah the bottle one not the cheap cheap can type i know i know i know what you're talking about then some of them are quite long so you just slice it and then it doesn't matter when we just put a few here and there throughout the whole long slice i like to eat sushi i got very sick of it when you eat too much you get sick of it but once in a long long time after making uh ya you don't feel like eating right at night uh i couldn't eat dinner you know when i was eating dinner i feel like throwing out i know what you mean right once ah my uhm went out word the the whole family was making this popiah you know make and eat make and eat i ate about four or five you know that that was early in the morning and then after that tea time  word  there there were so many days so we just ate away then the other day you just want to puke already you don't feel like eating at all no i mean eating other things my uhm cook dinner you see so it's like i don't word  i just couldn't eat lah and the worse is that when i cook my own dinner our our i won't eat it i won't eat definitely like that day last night i was cooking spaghetti for a meal the the the mouth word forty-five minutes already right after i've done it put on the table i just don't want to eat ha i don't like to cook because i cannot enjoy my meal after that oh is it i don't mind like i can still eat is it i can i don't i lose my appetite ha don't know maybe because i don't cook very often i don't cook at all i mean back in perth i cook twice a week oh is it then the other i think i was the only one who do the cooking in the household the rest of them you all take turns is it ya we take turns lah two twice a week then  word  one day we rotate lah every sunday ya sometimes we don't want to cook cook two meals right uhm no only cook dinner lunch we all settle by ourselves cook for the whole three of you is it three of us only lor then what do you cook rice the basic uh rice soup rice usually we just cook two dishes one meat one vegie then maybe sometimes we have soup but usually if we cook soup we put the meat inside so we still have about two dishes oh then chin chye eat lah ya lor chin chye lor what can you do it's not like wah four five dishes no need uh cannot ah how to afford we are trying to save money not only that a lot of time you have to you know ya actually you don't need that much for me uh i i just fry an egg ah i can i can eat whatever like that know ya my household they don't really like to eat eggs oh i love eggs ah for me also second year i always cook eggs i love egg you know ya half-boil half-boil fry scramble ya ya i love eggs ya omelette anyway when nobody's at home right i just make egg so easy it's the easiest dish anyway when you cook noodle you throw an egg inside ya ya i throw an egg inside eat with bread you you get me hard boil egg as well aye i like i like egg sandwiches i like i like too aye one day we make ah egg i think we should do it because every breakfast is you gotta spend a lot of money or you say that once in a while we eat it's okay but having here and there i think quickly makes up and in and we remove it high it can be quite expensive ya that is true then you order a drink everyday so i think when he ask me about stationery as you were saying up we should we both should do it together because then i won't leave or anything i think we should have a pantry pantry most important we need a fridge no get those small fridge ya lah small fridge but even so i don't know okay i think we should agree not in any need of fridge i think we need a little bit of word not oven oven-toaster toaster not toaster bread-toaster that type you know just heat up a little bit of food ya bread-toaster lor don't you think not not bread-toaster bread-toaster oven-toaster lah is just for bread ya ya ya those oven-toaster ah oven-toaster i think we should you know it's very practical but i think we we don't yet slowly lah we get the more essential things first fridge is it fridge fridge is important we can store things inside ya but like you put your fruits you bring from home you put your fruits you throw inside then then but not in a hurry yet we get the other things first like the desk and all that first we need only one more desk one desk then chair what chair chair we don't need a chair don't need ah there can you see we got four chairs here already what okay lor okay this desk is boon that one is for me yours will be the same one all three of ours three of us should get the same chairs and tables of course he will have this big chair if he wants to get another table he should get a bigger one for himself at least both of us share the kind of table then there won't be some kind of discrepancy this one will be for this computer like when you are not at your desk working you want to go to the computer you move the computer okay so we need another desk we need i think we need two cupboards ah how many cupboards do you think we need i think at the moment we don't need more than one cabinet because he hasn't finished using this one you see he has quite a lot of things already really i think he needs to clear because he has a lot of repeated and all those brochures and everything all repeated i'm never dare to touch i i mean at least jason help him to maybe he has uh ya some kind of cabinet lah just now do you realise he was looking around for something is it you won't believe it no he need something for storing his film i don't know what kind of you need a special cabinet but how long does the film last ha does it expire after a while you keep it properly it can last it can last ah look at the way he has kept it's it's expose to light most of the time and this thing rub up and down i i think it's personally that he need a big cabinet oh so we need a film cabinet even we don't have a cabinet we can buy those kind of bags bags big bag then you just put inside i thought of buying boxes box can lah box can boxes ikea boxes okay okay okay then we get another of this cabinet do you want to get this type this looks very ugly but it's basic this is the standard office cabinet i think for both of us we need some kind of cupboard also right for our own do we no lah we come out ah our thing will start piling out on the table already ya you need files we need some kind of files filing system for our own lah no when you start carrying a lot of things like you send your graphics everything instead of having like maybe yours we have a carrier and the other one the thing is you need to systematically keep you can't just store up here know look at mine i mean i've been trying my best to keep it clean then he comes and he meddle up all over again ya that's true my previous office we have a lot of files one on the table i think we should but here no file no no ta no files what i mean files on the table oh files on the table word  i think we should get those types of shelf shelves ah we should we can maximise space that way you know think that shelf you can you put a few file then put one on top there so it looks really it looks like it's part of the desk that looks like your bedroom no you can i don't know whether he'll allow if we put shelves shelves maximise space but for us it's very unoffice like you know really if we can make it very cosy when do we have to be office like ya what's more we're advertising agency you know so it must be as creative as possible when i went to weli ads right it was so cute you know ya is it the receptionist sits at this little room where you first go in right then they have this banana tree fake banana tree and a monkey big look quite big so cute the monkey's quite quite tall lah up to here then they have a little treasure box you open up right then they throw their stuff there but it's like a treasure box so it's very cute then it's a shophouse so you walk up oh that's cute walk up right with a winding then you walk up alright then they have this lounge not they call it a lounge right you sit around and they have meeting there and the table uh is cane you know it's not those type of office table you know it's cane actually i think we should standardise all cane and and the chair we require all cane you know it's all very nice and then it's quite cosy and then you have a little bar counter don't know why wah it's their it's their pantry but they make it like a bar counter so it's high pi word high chair you know high stool and a little thing and then 
Singapore	what this is most unnatural right can you uh can you speak as well you can't we try to manage aye you going into word straits times or newpaper uhm straits times ya straits times which beat do you know which beat you'll be doing i've no idea because i i i haven't met them yet you see tomorrow will be first time but i suppose it's gonna be just one interview unless uhm unless they want me to see somebody else no have they already uhm told you that you're accepted is it or no no no it's it will be oh an interview i see tomorrow it be a last hurdle i suppose ah ha ah ha it's just that i i went for the test okay ya a lot of people leaving that's why uhm i suppose it's quite high ya the attrition rate is very high but not as high as sbc lah sbc is worse sbc ya i suppose so but the let's not be bothered by this okay just treat it very informal ya he's the one know who's making everything so how's life okay haven't seen you for years ya since raffles hall days right i think so ya you were at raffles hall right weren't you i was i was but your you went into teaching right still teaching what our frank told us you quit well st is my ticket out of teaching when it happens lah you know pauline right which pauline from newpaper pauline as in pig-tail pig-tail one oh okay ya i know i just bump into her uhm at wesley church uhm i think she's full-time with uhm with uhm a church not wesley we we met there for a seminar she's working she's a full-time worker ya serious ah ya so unlike her is it ya are you are we talking about the same pauline or ya pig-tail pauline uh specki glasses ya very uh looks like she came from china very jumpy uh very bubbly sort of  word class ya ya ya ya it must be her lah anyway ya it's her newpaper oh she is there you were there together right for a while that's good ha ya ya we were who left first you right i left first she's back she was there i think about four years i think she joined them when they started ya i was there with them when they started too  word were doing the launch right and everything ya we were doing the launch he she was with me she was with me through uh out through ya school of journalism and all ha but i heard that it's quite bad about what school of journalism of course why it's fallacy doesn't teach you anything well in that case they should scrap ie too it's a bigger fallacy ya ya correct i i can't i think uhm i think ie is worse i hope this is not going to be like you know uhm actually taken against us you know because the i don't know lah i i really couldn't stand it you know i were you there i was i was i told them this is it this is the last straw you know why a friend of mine and i went we wanted to hand in this assignment early you know because the date due was something like twenty-ninth of april that's going to be a problem because most of us wanted ya we wanted to submit early right you know our our the the department told oh you can't you we don't know where to put it please come back on the twenty-ninth ya the the tray the box or something is not here yet you know can you imagine is it rita skuya uh it wasn't no because when you submit you submit through the administration you know ha ha if you remember your sub you submitted but you see they are they are given like different secretaries you see to to handle ya ya ya i noticed that i don't know which which uh secretary i can't remember her lah i noticed she had a space crisis but no that's so silly isn't it don't you have to serve the bond right ha i escaped it i didn't sign it i left before i signed it just before i signed it so how long were you in ie about three months i think it's about three or four months right before you enough to to fiddle to know what's it feel to know ya oh that's crazy i mean you know there was this lesson that we go through that they teach you how to make transparency ah and oh how to use the blackboard that's the worst how to use the chalk how to use the blackboard that was like i skip the lesson uh please divide into four then can you write in this fashion word or not ya ya ya but how could you skip i skip i skip lessons oh you skip lessons ah because you see we have the benefit of like past uhm student past year student telling us about what to skip you see so ya and we were the guinea-pigs what what we've to go through the whole everything what batch were you eight-seven 1987 that's the year you graduated ya that's the last year right without bond uh no no no there is a bond but you know it's sign mid mid way through the course it's not right at the beginning no but at our time they make us sign right from beginning oh they got smart no lah but 1987 was a very bad year if you remember so there were a lot of people applying to to to what about newpaper how's it newpaper ah newpaper was fun if if i had to go back to full-time work again i think if i had my way that would be the best so you left primarily because of your because i got married you know how you you are you're going to be ready right for the horrible hours but excuse me this is the this is the you know we we're even to have a book publish on women women in singapore uh most women about the other women ya most women are ya most women are like you know either they're single no lah or they're you know they're let me tell you lah in straits times most women are either single divorced married again or they're not straight or they're not straight that's quite true so far i'm telling about us from reporters you know ya the the the sub-editors are not like that because they lead pretty regular grave-yard hours you see because they're always on grave-yard so they can at least have some order to their lives you must be prepared because there was one stretch where i was working nine to twelve midnight nine am twelve midnight nine am twelve for four days in a row that's when i after i've done it was exhilarating and all that you see if you're on a high you can't sleep at night you know imagine going back at twelve and you've just finished this glo glorious story you know you can't sleep so you know it's very very unhealthy i decided i mean it's not fair what if i'm going to get married to put someone through all that ya that's true lah there was this woman who perpetually had her husband waiting outside but you see not all husbands can do that know and is it fair or not to ask all husbands do that for you even if yours did it it will come a point where it's too much you know he says it's too much ya can you imagine she he would sit you know she would be typing her story he'll sit right before are we finished no she he can sit there for four hours you know i think to a certain extent teachers too during term time lah but at least we have a lull you know like during the break ya uh they go on holiday you know no there is no such thing as a lull if you're a good reporter there's never a lull ya so maybe you know you can say that you pace yourself but if you're a good reporter you can never let a story go you know that's true that's true so how how how could you ya you still dancing or not uhm a bit lah not not not so much ya this is suppose you pig to mine chris yes so long were you there newpaper i was there about two and a half years three years two years that's quite long long enough lah you know word  the but it's a very it's very enjoyable as a single it's okay but if you are thinking of marrying i don't think it's very a healthy life that's true even as a single it's a very all consuming thing right isn't it ya it is it is and you get jaded very fast you get very cynical there was it came to stage where you know about what people life life in general ya you mean you you get this jaded that when people call in and say oh there's an accident along paterson road then you know someone will ask very casually anybody died or not nobody died ah forget it so many vehicles i suppose it's just like doctors right after a while you know ya ya ya it's like you dis you know you could dissect someone eating char kway teow or something like a friend of mine sheng kwai was telling me that he has got this friend not friend lah you know bb boy he became a houseman and you know being christians and know that they're supposed to be compassionate compassionate but after a while it's like you know treat it like another person another patient you know i mean it's another body  word  to cure ya i mean when you're especially when you're covering say the midnight hours can you be imagine how much word  do you have when you're like half asleep and some patients are very difficult same thing lah that's true so i got to i realize lah that i that's not what i want to become you see you look around you know and you of course there are people who survive if you're talking about christians there are quite a number of very you know strong christians in journalism yes there are but very few of them i suppose chong jin will be one of them chong jin are you kidding chong jin is the wayward one but he was i mean he was he was like ra ra all fire you know no he's not anymore that that scared me i also saw him you know going that way it you know we used to look up to him like some sort of mo role model because he was one of those who was very uhm he was zealous but not to the extent where he he you know like i i don't know how you describe him no he strike one as a very balanced who's really who lead a very strong moral fibre it's no longer so no but you know you see him fall and he himself has no regrets you know i think from the way he speaks the way he talks about it it's like it's this one aspect of life and he his uh his religion has become a philosophical thing so it was very scary we were you know we we did talk quite a bit when we were in there so it scares you radiant i'm not sure i mean i'm just buying a do you know i just accept this as buying a ticket out of what i'm doing now which school are you teaching at ahmad ibrahim ha ahmad ibrahim secondary school that's like way in jurong uh that's what everybody thinks it's not ah it's eventually uh in uh yishun yishun it used to be in upper thomson road but they moved oh ya it's just one of those things lah named after the it's suppose to be the first malay minister but it's a very difficult school isn't it it's not not notorious not really it's supposed to be a the better school in the north north really why do i always have this impression that it's one of those difficult schools because of the name maybe ahmad ibrahim you know like sunila utama i don't know how the students ever live that down sunila utama i come from sunila i hope they think of a change you know ya i mean there're so many schools named after roads you know what i mean so silly there's going to be an ang mo kio avenue two school something very soon ya but your school's not good enouh to be named after somebody like somebody substantial but i suppose i think you've always been the kind of person who wants everything in life ya i suppose i don't think you'll settle just for a career ya i don't think so it's it gets to you know after awhile you you realise that a lot of the so-called strong women there you you observe them you know they ya their career is everything it's all consuhming that i think to ex word they think they're so emanci emancipated and you know they are not uhm they they're their own person and all actually they're not there're actually slave to their work they're strong because they have no other choice you see what are the alternative i mean if they if they don't act strong they have to admit that oh oh they have chosen the wrong path or ya ya i mean i have known so many s b c producers i mean like uhm i mean even millie who are okay i mean not not sort of like it doesn't sound like our sub-cultural groups lah like you know but normal women who are very feminist but deep down they still have this problem urge with their emotional dependence i ya i've never been a feminist i think depends on what you mean by feminist i mean you can be a feminist without losing your essential femaleness you know so at the end of the day you're made to need somebody ya so if you deny that then you deny that part of yourself you know because a lot of the editors uh are all of course they are all children of the sixties lah no not children of the sixties i think they went throuh the sixties in their teenage years you know so for them you know feminism is such a burning thing but i think in their late later years now like they're in their thirty-nine and forty they start to realise that maybe they've gone wrong but it's too late to admit it isn't it without losing every you know it takes a lot of to admit maybe without without making sound like you've made a mistake i think that's a sad thing i mean look at pat chan i you still think she's a victim of her own achievements you know i think she has achieved so much you can't even live it down it's like how can i ever like you know going for a man you know what is it that he has that i don't you know special organs why do you think word  she's gonna fix the organs as well because i think she's not really i don't know i mean i know her as a person but she's a very charming person you know she likes to dress up you know she likes to you know everytime there's anything new at issey miyake she will go and buy but she'll only scarves and shirts i find you know what i mean she's not really i don't think she's i mean more new word you know but i thouht she was a the reason why she became like that was her father injecting her with hormones

cheap there it's about thirty dollars like one night thirty twenty us can't remember so cheap twenty us or something like that four or five star five five-star very big lah very nice like that you

now ah actually i feel very sian uh ya actually it it's quite different from what i felt last week when i finish gnn word and i i look forward for this trip to start anew now quite sian ya i think i feel quite sian that's why when i was telling my friend also i said i told you i feel very sian then she just said why the worst thing is i've been for or word  ya i think it's worse for you and just now they were talking about canada it's in summer the weather is very cool i said aiyah and i am not going there ya hor i know what you mean never mind people always ask me how did your boss allocate people like those who have been before also go again kind of strange i don't know because i am doing exactly the same thing as kong weng detention demurrage and cost so is either he is here or i'm there doing but he's less experienced lah in terms of no lah i think we learn cost at the same time because german trident was my first agent audit also before that i keep doing those other companies you know like forwardees forwarders different from weng choo's but actually boss didn't allocate the sections you do what he just allocate the job only no he did allocate like roughly this person will do cost or revenue i think just basic things cost revenue financial like that these three areas alright i think so from what he said lah i just very i think people affect me a lot do they affect you a lot i mean people's behaviour did you if they are very jovial i will feel very happy then i think i would work faster hor don't know lah i think it depends a lot on me also not so much of the surrounding so got to cheer up hor ya okay so i think we can we can a difference all right doesn't that reminds me of somebody aye we can go to a christian bookshop cheap ah it's very big you know three stories that's good ah anyway what's the name can't remember nearby i i can remember how to go i think i can ask the girl the christian girl i think we should look forward to it ya lor we try to

and she would you know so are are you but he's feeling rather down she's feeling down because uh of course who flung exam who won't feel down no not so much that i would but she's afraid that because he'll be starting work on monday  word doing his fi where is he he'll be doing his plc on monday where at the subcourts oh he's gonna sub not as as one of the no it's compulsory for them to do for for three months there then go to the firm after that then then go the firm for for pl uh for what you call that pu pupillage ah pupillage that's right so and you know she'll she'll be away for say about almost two three months you say she's afraid that you know another woman knowing knowing nicholas roh uh nicholas loh and what's he capable of who might just you know fall for another girl nick ah you think he will or not now has he tone down or do you think he's tone down i mean he use to be a real a real cool guy so you know getting girls is never been a problem for him and i feel that you know but i think he has changed because he did tell me that perhaps this girl is more for keeps but but four months for him with only one girl is a record what so maybe that's right ah it's true also but you know either that never foresee him settling down with a girl so so he pass so pass he's quite young ah he's only twenty-five twenty four that's right and i feel that i mean anything can happen ya you got that so when you going out with him uhm tuesday we're in fact we're twelve of us are all going down to the game singapore and perlis this tuesday myself uh william uh kenny goh holmer nick uh sudip gosh oh boy that one came back ah yogi uh edward tan peter sim christopher goh and dominic nagolindran and clidas actually said is our good friend coming or not i get from maybe so i said ya sure maybe when we're coming i mean catch up on old ties you know ya what you call that uh what is what is sudip gosh doing the doctor gosh oh he's now a doctor gosh he's he passed already just passed ah and then is he is he coming back to singapore is he going back but he has to go back to do some specialisation thing he's gonna he's not coming back he's going to live in england lah probably that's right no i'm not sure about that but he knows that you know with his kind he needs to you know at least get into something more specialised why he's a ma ma ah ya well you know there are too many doctors here they don't want ah so how you spoke to him uh no i spoke to clidas actually only clidas then he told you that gosh is that's right and they are all planning to meet on tuesday he'e he's going to bug tickets ah in fact i got the tickets already but chris is getting the tickets for the rest of them you how many you got extra for me but but nick just call me just today and told me that he'll want a ticket you see so uhm i've decided to get another friend of mine to go down again ah get some more lah sure can sell what that's steven tan's kanna ya that's right but i think should do well lah i think they would redeem themselves after the you know opening jitters that's right against selangor second division might have opening jitters so have you been down to nus or not lately no lah why nus not been to that for ages i think i went there the last week i thought the the silly kway teow man normally he's open till late right last week which one which kway teow man oh the hor fun is it arts canteen arts canteen so i went down after after work that day she and i felt like my significant other and i felt like eating kway teow lah so i said come go nus kway teow damn siok one dollar only went all the there it was close last week oh dear i forgot school was didn't open till this week so maybe sometime this week but i heard from friends who are there that it's very crowded you know uhm no lah evening after work but this is the first week of of term you see and you know the usual paranoiac kiasuism syndrome is you know first week that's right you know what nothing happens till at least word  ya i mean people like lining up to buy this buy that get everything ya usual ya and you know the first two weeks of headaches where you go round fighting for your combination and getting you know that's probably all what you call that what's the orientation like this year which groups of link uh which orientation oh you mean talking for the hopps the jams uh no idea nothing interesting can find out lah i got lot of friends who happen to be there how's stanley so are you going are you going anywhere today ya where were we like uhm what you're doing today uhm i got to go for soccer game at i got a soccer training session at three o'clock uh where victoria ah ya that's right our boys would be down there about three-thirty you went to novena already ah no later i doubt if i can make it for today's session aiyah how terrible and i feel bad also but the thing is uhm we're having a tournament coming up you see is it organised by the school of physical education and you know so i was gearing my boys up for the for the championship actually so you got chance or not well i'll rate our chances as fifty fifty i thought it's suppose to be at least semi-finals uhm well touch and go but i mean with a bit of luck we may just you know even clinch the title actually you're suppose to ah how many years already to date this alternate year suppose to win ya we have but uhm a group and a bunch of dedicated boys you know committed what about their coach well uhm tell me more about him lah the coach well what can i say i mean you know with that kind of bunch of kids that you have you know is he a good coach or not and the kind of enthusiasm that they have been showing and training you know i think that's enough to carry me and get me going carrying on with what the job you see so you saying the coach is not doing much lah the boys are helping themselves no i'm i'm sure the boy it's the boys who are going to be out in the field to play ultimately and the and the coach get only do that much fine i i feel deep down you know uhm that i've been quite inspirational and in a sense also been uhm very supportive the boys you know and they look up to me that sense you know as a friend rather than a as a friend and also like a an older brother you see so and that's the interesting about teaching you know which i really enjoy because i realise that you know teaching is not just what goes round within the perimeters of a classroom it extends beyond those boundaries and just as much as you are learning so much about the students you are also learning so much about yourself true true see and i really enjoy what i am doing actually uhm so shiok lah i then your speech how's your so how does your speech go oh ya tell me i never heard your speech you're supposed let me hear how it goes what what's there to say but anyway next saturday by the way uhm the school'll be having a speech day and the minister of education lee yoke suan will be down and there is a strong probability that i am i have important uh official announcement will be made with regards to independ with regards to autonomous schools and and there's a strong chance in fact in fact highly probable that victoria will be one of the schools going autonomous you see what's auto what the difference between autonomous and independent autonomous are so call what they claim to be uh quality education at a low cost but we're not really independent in the true sense of the word but we do have certain uhm leeway on the part of our principal you know planning and hiring like like the choice of teachers whom he wants to come over to our school and in terms of you know using funds because we would be given a grant of some seven hundred thousand dollars and you know not bad that doesn't mean you can get pay rise lah no not really pay pay rise because we still part and parcel of the ministry of education still you see we're still under them but in terms of having uh electives being offered to students and we can sort of conduct some of our own programmes you see so in that sense  ri independent ah 
Singapore	well i went to see dr goatly today because i uhm missed his lecture on friday he was very nice he uhm of course he couldn't spend two hours with me lah so he really ah he just said okay lah i'll i'll uhm just half an hour and he went through the lecture told me little bit about what went on then i asked him about the uhm the assignment on page twenty-five remember the one we have to do oh dear i haven't looked at it yet have you looked at the notes i have printed for you no not yet but he gave me all all the readings lah he photostated so he told me not to worry about the assignment ah ha he said that he is not going to record the marks he just wants to see how we're getting on so he told me not to worry he said that it it may return to us or may not be returned to us it may be marked or not marked or not marked but he said he is not going to the marks he said he just us to get practice in this what uh rhythm is it so we are not good at rhythm right ya rhythm it is true i have rhythm he gave you an a handout right ya he gave me a handout uh then he gave me the halliday one right all the the suggested readings lah i think the halliday one is it halliday you mean he gave you that so many things he gave you he gave me all these uh is it that page is it from aye you are so what you call that organised yes no i am not i don't have my files you know i just stick to my notes and dump them on the floor do you know where i got these files from i don't know from my church camp oh it is word  ya because extras so i just took oh you mean oh i see we bought for the kids you see i see i see some things the church camp that means i mean well not really camp lah seminar not their school right no why does he like huang ing ing she likes his voice hopelessly devoted to you love me tender no he likes her voice he does he said so ah i think so did he say this this one is it this one sorry it's not it's widdowson right yes sorry it's not halliday geoffrey leech widdowson and leech okay so quite easy to read them oh is it good ya quite easy to read anyway but the terms that he used quite chim right yes i haven't read it yet no the the handout the handout oh ya he some of the ones he through with me for half an hour ya then he told me take out a pen to draw arrows yes yes he gave us the wrong direction that day ya this one some of the terms are quite formidable lah but once you i supposed we won't be tested right on the history of stylistics how it evolved and all that don't know i hope no lah i don't think so ah hard to apply it right what time did you arrive today i arrived at eleven o'clock and went straight to his office oh and then what you went upstairs to the m a room no then after that i met chris i mean he happened to walk walk by dr goatly's room and we went for lunch ee so sweet so nice yes and then and then after lunch uh you know there's some bazaar going on right downstairs yes so we walk round and then bought anything no uhm uhm oh okay then i went to photocopy this book which uh chris photocopied uhm uhm where uhm the basic text for uhm teaching for specific purposes oh you mean he actually got that one the book is not in the bookshop right you can't find it in the bookshop ya it is i i mean and you can't find it in the main shelf right yes somebody simpan right i we don't know who lah but uh uh somebody from last year bought the book so you zap from there so christopher zapped her book and since you know i was there and all so he asked me whether i wanted so i photocopied for myself one i i made a copy lah of the whole book the whole book ah the whole book do you have it here no it will be ready tomorrow so if you want you can have a look at the book you mean to say we can there is a photocopier somewhere i will tell you where okay chris brought me there where you take the bus the internal shuttle twenty cents go uh where k r hall is faculty club what does k r stand for kent ridge hall yes okay downstairs basement downstairs basement that means opposite the swimming pool right yes you'll see the swimming pool okay it is called goh brothers how many people are there i mean is it like the ten years ago type ten years ago uhm then i don't know it's like how many girls were servicing two but then you don't see people photocopying right they seem to be like just taking orders and like and they will bind for you you see oh that is very good ya so that's what i did lah so what did you do i know i want to get the book the book do you mind lending it to me no i don't mind you can have a look you can have it and to photocopy i mean well the book doesn't belong to me lah but maybe you can take my photocopied version ya yes yes because i i went to the what what is that stupid thing call the computer then it gave me the call number but it wasn't on the shelf and it is not out so some body must be hoarding it or it is stolen ya which is very possible the other alternative is to go to r e l c r e l c has a very good collection of books you know but i know this mrs selart word but ya you return in two week's time and ah very troublesome lah to go there what is this perfume is it no it says pure fat burning and water reduction formula what super cuts i got to see that delicious citrus flavour i must see this this uh uh weight weight reduction my goodness me chris will have all this is in the recording ya hundred per cent natural fast acting his private life i've got to have this ask him about it how long does he want us to speak i don't know how long does he want us to speak how long an hour until the the tape finishes what oh it stinks it does is it edible or not in the first place don't know it's awful don't know what we're suppose to do let me see let me try can i lick it put my tongue in it and lick it yucks then you then you will suddenly be very slim awful right ya aye if your mom back no i am still alone at home i am so happy happy ah i thought you were miserable that you you had nobody to greet you no i love to be alone at home do you have a a pet at home no you don't right no but i guess after three weeks i will miss my parents lah but now i'm quite happy you mean your mom has retired ah ya oh so good so what is she doing with her life uhm well she does she goes out with her friends how old is she how old do you i will you be when you retire i mean what's the retiring age i guess i will be sixty for your mom is is she fifty yet my mom ya she's fifty-eight oh but i thought it's sixty right oh she i guess she opted for fifty-five fifty-five she stopped oh so she extended two years ah she stopped at you mean stopped for quite a number of years ya ya that's right last year only oh and then helena helena has not reached her retirement age yet right no she that means she's she resigned that means or early retirement is it you call it early retirement i don't know they they have an option will she will she lose her pension don't know i'm sure she belongs to the pension era ya i like stylistics you know > ice-sin:s1a-059#> it is very fun do you like p c ya ya i love pc i love dissecting things i don't like theories i don't like too much of theories you know i mean theories that you have to i suppose ya lah i mean in a way phonology and all that those are theories right actually in everything is a theoretical construct right but i like those where you can apply and l love doing parsing things like that i find it very fun i don't like those where you have to memorise and regurgitate that means you would have hatred for history right yes i never did well in history the best i got was d7 and an o but econs you would have liked econs yes econs i i did very well stats maths you would have like maths yes i like maths aye why didn't you major in maths because i had i don't know maybe i had a lousy teacher i had eighteen upon hundred for maths in sec two so when the teacher was teaching i would draw cartoons and then she'll come to me and stare at me and i looked at her in defiance i remember breaking down in tears but when when i was in sec four i had this teacher you know who is so fierce every time he comes in he looks at a vulture you know you know those black frame old fashion type then he will put his hand behind oh that sounds like the uh have you done have you done your homework it is like you what more work that kind old fashion right ya but i think nowadays i think our students are not afraid of us at all anymore no no but mine are you know because when i go to class it's like i am leading a choir leading a choir or an orchestra when i go to class i expect absolute silence there good morning class don't know how i do that then they will say good morning mrs chng i said no then i don't like that tune can you try again so terrible hey from r j you went to a school near your home right ya just below my flat what was that called ha what school was that yua hua yua hua secondary school then from there you went to ministry of education moe ya you went last year is it last year hey you know how i found out that you were in the ministry of education prospectus the prospectus i saw a i saw ya ya i saw your name on the board on the staff welfare board you see for enquires contact mrs jane chng oh i found course i don't know what course he ought to throw this away shall we do him a favour anyway yes aye do you remember this girl call melanie from where 
Singapore	i think at present the subject i like most is uh i think el 407 407 ya it's uhm i mean it's education and something that i find to be very practical especially for next line because i'm thinking to going to teaching and i don't know i mean i i like the lecturer's style of teaching his his firstly he speaks quite he's able uh i'm able to follow it systematically and i'm i'm able to you know take down notes easily easily also i mean and uh i don't know why i mean he is quite interesting in a way also and i can i'm able to grasp the concept i'm okay what about yourself i mean what do you like for me i like i like models best 402 because i i think it's very interesting because there's there's three different theories and basically we sort of put into practice what we have for the past three years which is grammatically analysis and it's more in depth sort of analysis so to do that what what i've learnt for three years is more worthwhile in doing that course and personally i like narrative structures i think that's very interesting uh i was i was a little bit worried about narrative structure i mean am i uhm am i how should i say something like uhm okay so far what i've done in a in the narrative structure lectures right i think sort of anything from 305 because i never been taken 305 so my worry is there you see i guess at at the moment we we haven't done anything on 305 uh but basically a very i think it's a very subjective course so whatever your point of view whatever you feel as long as you can justify you should get be able to get a good grade what do you feel about uh i mean lexicology and semantics i don't quite like semantics and lexicology for one point because the lecturer seems to seem the lecturer seems to be very uhm disorganised and uh i mean i don't know it's like okay like for example semantics uhm it's like as if it's not really prepared you see so and so because of that it's not very structured anything can be discussed during the seminar so i'm not very used to such lecturer basically i'll be i'm quite at a loss as to what is important and what is not and uh for lexicography it's the same thing ya because it's very funny to go into a lecture to a seminar and then come out and and have this uhm sense that maybe i i mean come out with little so i don't know if that's the essence of it i mean uhm he spoke a lot you see but then the lesson seems to be very little so i don't know if that's what it is uh whether those are the main point or whether i've lost a lot of thing you know that's about how i feel i basically i feel that lexicology is just you and there there will not be much knowledge being past and a lot of practice and a lot of skill and because it depends on intuition i i think that some people will do better regardless whether they read more or less than other people i've not very good intuitions i mean certain things i just don't see the way the lecturer sees ya do you watch uh anyway do you watch watch it i mean the show it no oh you didn't oh i mean you watch tv word ya do you watch tv i mean sometimes i i mainly watch i like to watch laser disc laser disc oh you have laser disc yes so we we me and wife we always borrow things that both of us are interested in usually the tv has things that one of us oh so what what do you usually do you watch i mean shows like my fair lady the sound of music on laser disc it's very clear how much is it a text i mean to you mean a recorder or the renting you mean you got a recorder you need a recorder you have a recorder i don't i'm using my word when i stay at my friend's house so i'm using his recorder how much is the disc i mean the rental rental is very cheap normal video tapes about four to five dollars laser disc cost about four dollars can if you rent three discs and above you can have it for one week and and the thing is it's good as you can just search the part that you want to see because the whole story is broken up into a few segments and for certain laser disc for draculla and and you can choose the ending that you want oh so they will they will actually this side b at the end right they will have ending a ending b and you select your own oh that means ah the the show is then you mean what i mean you mean the dracula as in best of the dracula ah the recent one there are three different endings yes because they sometimes the director takes a few cuts then he he picks the best one he goes according to audience's liking oh i see so you get to play director sometimes oh so it's very fun know you know what i mean you choose no shiok then you just change so what you i mean can you can only change the ending can you change anything else  word of it no only the ending i mean main things are there sometime they give you a a a a lot of extra footages like n gs uh what's n gs n g is like not good scenes so when the uh actors laugh or they forgot their lines oh i see or when their room drops down oh the telephone i think ignore it i think we should ya i think so lah i mean anyway it's not our room it's not our room actually it's quite a good investment your family can see my mom actually thought about that thing sort of a setting up a home theatre ya but then uhm we're thinking that it's no point because we live in a three-room flat whatever we do i mean you know you you need a very big house to have something like that a special room for this and then otherwise it will be it sorts of defeat the purpose because also you get karaoke and all that right ya actually it doesn't know because a simple set cost about two three two to three thousand i mean about thousand over a tv thousand over for a laser disc and i i find that's the one that my friend has why why you have you already have a tv must you get another i mean a new tv uh you you need not have to if your tv is what they good enough or functional enough because laser disc offer a lot of uh options like surround sound stereophonic sound effect oh i see if you don't have a good tv with very good speakers the joy is like half gone you get very clear image but not not clear sound oh i see yes well don't know i mean anyway the money has gotten into making cabinets room cabinets actually that's more functional ya well so will you be attending the talk this uh coming tuesday ya i will be i mean the ya i mean i was looking through it seems that they they place a lot of emphasis on the teaching ya actually it's quite a fix of set compared to the other one the other one is more demanding in terms of its direction uh but the teaching one is more demanding in the actual course it seems that you fail the teaching you fail the whole course ya and the the worry is that i mean you got to go and you got for practical uhm experience right you got to go and teach in the primary schools or secondary schools in england that was uhm this sorts of you know like make make me makes me wonder uhm i mean when you teach the school in england then how i mean like our english is not their their english ya i mean will they be able to accept most probably not and then how when it comes to such things but will will that deter you from applying i think i'll just go and try and not think too much about it ya ya that's word that's how i'm going to do too i guess just to leave at least leave the options open you know but do you think it'll be more recognised if you come back as overseas scholar that's what i thought yep see ya and i mean should be right logically there's always been my dream to go to another country whether i'm going before to just study not for uh you know like a major course but just for a year course just see what's it's all about especially and what's like to study abroad so would you like to teach in a secondary or jc i think i'll like to teach in secondary uhm firstly it's because you know like during college time i find that the principals are quite idiosyncratic and very very demanding because of the a level you see and there are not many junior college here and then uhm i find that teaching in a secondary school might be more personal you can do it at a more personal level and uh don't know i'm finding i don't know i think i prefer to teach at n level than at jc will you prefer an all guys school uhm ya an any reasons any reasons ha i don't know either that or or or co-ed uhm better not all girl school especially the girls will bully the guys are you still are you thinking of teaching i mean at all i i don't know i'm i'm more thinking of a more stable job teaching is not stable actually i don't know i may leave because of my this idiosyncrasies i don't think i can i mean put in a gross gross way endure thirty years of teaching personally i i would like the job where i i could climb i mean and teaching even though you can climb i guess takes many years ten years it's more uh like something you love to do forever rather than be ambitious and word  it's different i guess it's like how what you want to do but teaching is like a vocation i was thinking of the police force police force but my wife is against it because it's quite dangerous right i think it's more dangerous than the army i find that uhm war is less real ya and you don't do that much because of you know like  word  police is like really you know what i mean you are really in fore front or another thing would be i hope to go and study some more probably come back and teach in a higher higher institution but that doesn't seem very likely oh then you'll never know right doctor peter ong but even though you have have the money you even though you have the qualifications you may not have the money get good results and may not have money to go but some of them like that means let's say you do okay let's say you get a very good honours that means you will continue with the masters i would rather go abroad abroad it all depends i mean then what your finance ah  if lets say there is this scholarship will you do it on your own finance i don't think i can't i i don't think i can 
Singapore	you know what he was doing the pragmatics do you remember or not i can't remember i know we did one we did one but i only remember word socio sociolinguistics last year sociolinguistics i didn't do that what i know what we did was for pragmatics we did one remember it was you were supposed to record down a conversation and you are supposed to do the grician word principle you supposed to apply grician principle to it can you remember that or not don't remember the declarative whatever whatever and then they had the other one was the weak forms you get somebody to read out the thing and then you get the weak forms oh ya ya ya ya that is true aye someone very cute look the thing lor it is very cute the poster that one reminds me of elaine's elaine's file elaine what elaine what is her name edward si warna word  that word  the long haired girl elaine as in ivan elaine ong oh okay but the one she had is not of a cat isn't it it is not on cats isn't it it is on dogs i know there is one where they were saying the wollen  word kept touching the nose molesting the dog there is one with the nose one very cute is it wait he reminds me after the after getting the the file cover right i wanted to put post cards you know of the dog and cats in it then i can't bear to lah why because once you once you stick them down to the file right then when you want to remove it next time like if you want to throw away the file and you spoil the post card you see don't stick ya then blue tac really ah i think so i mean that is what a lot of people do ya ya because the last file i had i had this saint bernard  word  was that the saint bernard's ya the one that i was trying to tear out later anyway the whole thing was spoilt so i had to throw the whole away aiyah so sad ya lah so sad because all my cats were there and my dogs what did you do you stick with double sided tape ah ya i couldn't tear out after that it was so it was really stuck there poor thing that means all the ones you throw away all the post cards you throw away ah ya ya aiyah aye so poor thing no lah i only had two nice ones one was a the black and white picture of the cat and one that was very nice the saint bernard that one but my file lei why that day elaine tried to put for me then it you know because the cover right it covers up to a certain extent and then it covers the the button because mine has got a press stud ya so you cannot cannot close the file if you put the cover on top because the cover will cover over the press stud ya but why don't you do it at the at the bottom lor only for the bottom then you might as well just laminate it right that means just the bottom i mean just the back of the file only has one oh i see what you mean you know because the thing has a flap right so when it covers the thing it there is a press stud right oh you are talking about put putting post cards or pictures there is it my file can't at all because of the weird shape of the file can nah because you see you have uhm right is a file then you fold it down right ya ya then you can you can still this space here what for your pictures that is where my garfield and v c f sticker is lor oh that that means you can't put anymore lah ya what what about at the back at the back nice empty fine because you see i if i put it at the back i need to cover it so i will it will get very dirty oh so you oh now you have only laminated your front is it i never even laminated the front what i did i just put a sticker and sticker are naturally laminated already i had the one with garfield and the green coloured ode the one that linda was saying you know then the v c f sticker i just wanted to cover the national university of singapore writing then you can laminate what you put a picture at the back and then paste the word  stick it on ma fun lah you laminate like that why you go and buy such difficult but i like i am i'm used to that type of file you know since j c i had this the the one with the flap that is why i hate the flap type you know why you can't put a lot of things in there because of then button once you if you stack it up real high right you can't close ya but isn't it the same with the others no the ring file we can put at least about this thick you know the stack of papers or whatever just put it there and it can still hold on to it but it drops off right ya ya lah because people like me need the covering that flap right as long as the flap can close ha i guaran i can guarantee that the the paper won't fall down you see so i need that in case it has happened to me so many times already in the bus right and then you hold the file like that in this  word  ya so embarrassing you know what my friend does she has you know the ordinary ring file you have this thing the the clip ya the clip here right then you have the rings here right and here is where you always put your papers and sometimes when your clip is too when when too many papers to clip you can't clip everything there right so what she does is that she puts the rest of the papers other side and she buys those thick clips oh and she clips it there oh ya i see what you mean you know what i mean oh no wonder a lot of people have those clips on their files on their files quite useful ha but i still cannot lah i am still not used to it i am still very used to that old type he's got so many posters in his room les miserables that l very nice aye i know are you going to watch cannot lah so expensive a hundred over right for one ticket for what the tickets are one two six but that is only for american express card holders i think there are cheaper ones you know my friend said she could cater for seventy you know because either they bought in bulk or something like that actually you can i think the cheapest is seventy but uhm for for american card holders when they send you the forms right i think they charge you one two six no because they said the tickets are seventy right and those for seventy dollars you are getting the front row seats since when how i don't know how she do it lah she i think they bought in bulk a lot a lot so then they were trying to get rid of it seventy so is she trying to rid of it now i don't know kareen chow also wants me to go and fine out can can can can maybe i will find out for you lah whether the thing is is lin is linda going i don't think linda's going she didn't say anything then how come she she's got the pamphlet there she can get pamphlet without buying the ticket what but usually you don't like put it right in at the top of your book you know without wanting to go actually i want to go and see nutcracker suite but kareen chow to see it so i didn't want to see that is so mean i know no because he said he said he wanted somebody to see it with him and then clara said that she would she would only go if somebody else would go with them clara as in what clara as in the sub com ah sub com clara so she only said she would go with kareen chow if somebody else follows so kareen chow asked me to go would you go depending on what is going on between the both of them ya but i mean it is like even the invitation in itself is is not sincere you know no lah let's put it this way i'm not interested in going to watch the thing all things all other things aside you don't like nutcracker suite uhm not that i don't like lah but i mean no particular interest but i'd rather go and les miserables aiyah don't want i don't like to see opera aye les miserables it is a musical right no it is not it is a musical it is wonderful aye don't think and the music is very good les miserables is by who andrew lloyd webber ah no it is not it's by some what's his name macintosh i think macintosh mac i can't remember his name

o'clock ya so then after that okay then i i i can't remember which button i press and then this you know the the the screen and then the page is like that right and then suddenly another one another page whatever you call that another whatever came out on top of it and then another one another one and it's like there are so many you know and i i was like oh my goodness how what do i do now how do i get back to my original page you see so i was clicking this clicking that aye ya tell you it took me the whole night to finally remove all all those things at the front close the page lah just close the page that was on top of the one the first one ya ya ya and then after but then after i close close them and then i got back to windows right then i click ms word again the whole thing came back again you saved it ah no i didn't save it what command did you do to word overlap i don't know page page few no don't know i can't remember you know when you are testing right you just just pressing any available key how did you how did it happen if only the computer doesn't go bizzard like that i think computers know first timers 
Singapore	well like i say kim is going to be in san francisco what's he gonna be doing there i don't know uhm because the the last time uhm kim came back i bump into kim in at the andrew's shop so so already told me said that he's going to be in san francisco and he ask i think he's managed to get kim uh kong shin's number from lionel i think really because i i thought the last time he was suppose to be an air-steward somewhere he's still an air-steward he's still flying what he's with oh dear i don't to say i think he's station in dubai now ya ya that's right he is supposed to be ya he's gonna be uh in in san francisco on the eight or something and then uhm what's he gonna be doing there he's going to be on holiday lor just a holiday ya because kong shin called me two nights ago collect so i told you right he called me collect kong shin called you collect ya it's five-fifty in the morning some more god shouldn't have accepted that stupid thing but anyway he called me ask me what am i going to do so i told him my plans oh kim's going to be there on eighth so he says probably kim is going to see him come see me at the airport i don't whether that's gonna be true or not ah ha but we'll see how lor oh okay is is he gonna stay with you or something he's gonna no lah kim is going to be i think kim is supposed to be in san francisco for probably for two weeks i was going to be there for few days and then i gonna fly off so you just gonna see him that's it i don't know i might join you after the exams but uhm i haven't really made up my mind yet i am still thinking about the cost well it depends lor on how you want to come home but this time you're buying a return ticket isn't it aren't you ya but what i gotta do is because i got two weeks after the exams you see i can go for a week so you want to fly you gonna fly down and fly back to london well i mean it's quite cheap you see for a return ticket that's about about two hundred pounds but then you'll fly as you have to fly to new york right most likely isn't it no you can fly just fly straight to san francisco i'm sure what's the airport at san francisco called sso i think is it uhm just give me kong shin's details all right kong shin is living with jerome now kong shin is living with jerome so i have jerome's number somewhere right  word i gotta transcribe this into my book lah because i don't know where i put all these things and i'm so aiyah so worried about getting carrying all those stupid things as well but but do you think kong shin will mind me coming over i don't know i don't think so lah i don't see why he should mind depending on when you want to come and depending whether he's got he's got really got a job there oh he's still looking for one i i ask him whether he's found one he says he's not gonna to talk about it because he's afraid he's going to jinx it i see no because i don't mind sleeping on the floor i've always roughed it out you see but anyway the thing is that jerome's place is is very very small oh you've been there ya i stayed there when i was as a student there last winter okay all right it's a studio apartment i must say that the apartment is very nice because it's a condo kind of living there's a there's three swimming pools three swimming pools within a condo what kind of place is that it's quite a big place it's like bayshore but not so tall buildings ah ha there's three swimming pools uhm and every and every building and every block downstairs like jerome's block downstairs you know they have every evening they have free aerobics classes for people living in the apartment really and next to the aerobic room you have the aerobics machine so you can do your stair you can do your your treadmill and then the next block will be the weights room oh it's quite shiok right it's quite good and ya the besides this there's also the steam and the sauna as well and there's a huge tv room downstairs with vcr equipment it is uhm well equipped as bayshore then bayshore is like that isn't it but i don't think bayshore has got the steam and sauna and don't have no no no no classes and ya they don't have the tv room i'm sure ya i don't think they have a tv but uhm sounds i mean they have it's like divided by the three but i didn't use the pool the last time it was cold but i use i i did use the weights room and what's the weather gonna be like in san francisco during this time of the year it's just going to be cool cool yes something like i don't know the same as london twenties i think probably twenty twenties is not cool it's hot usually if there if in the evening it gets down to about fourteen to sixteen it's jacket time right it's quite nice i like the weather in san francisco okay because uhm okay i i mean i'm just gonna try to tie this up right because my exams finish on the the weekend ending tenth of august around then i think tenth of august so soon ah ya no uh uh i mean tenth of september sorry ya are you gonna be still be there after that no i'm gonna be school already oh okay so there's no point me going then okay unless you want to go and then come down to arizona lor but i don't know what the whole schedule is like i don't even know what's this gonna be like i don't know how things are going to be like so it's quite lay chay come another time lah ya i probably will lah because uh when i start working i probably will have my own money and then i won't be bothered by my parents and all that i suppose see how lor spend is enough i mean last night all the shelling i got from them i don't see why you should be so bothered about the stupid thing at all i mean you know whoever gives it to you it's not their problem is it why are they so suspicious for anyway they are so suspicious of me is because my recent spate of events you see you're going out late because i'm chalking up bills okay here or there over in london right chalking up bills and oh they're the ones who pay then overdraft ya you you got overdraft facility meh ya students have overdraft facilities there very very clever oh you ha how much overdraft have you got uhm uh five hundred over pound overdraft all students get it but how how come they they can find out about it i have to tell them i owe me you some money so you very clever lor you and then is it because of that person basically i was spending because you know why i had dinners out lunch out dinners out and because of that person right why why because of that person but i mean usually you wouldn't right unless don't you cook i thought you cook i used to cook a lot right but the thing was it it didn't sound feasible because uhm you'll be out right and it takes you hours to get takes you an hour to get back all right and you then you got to do the shopping then you got to cook by the time you finished eating it's about what ten-thirty don't you like i don't know uhm buy just once a week enough groceries to last you for the week and then when before you go out just take things out of the freezer and put it in the fridge to thaw and then come back just pick up or even manu ma ma marinate it the night before or something and leave it in there i i know but but the thing is it's always took too much time you see aiyah i really don't know lah i probably will have to start cooking i don't think i want to eat out too much because i'm kind of looking forward to to to the fact that i'll be totally responsible for my own diet then i can sort of eat things i want to eat the only thing well even even if you eat out you can always uhm uhm control the things you eat because uhm not necessarily over over in word over in london you know things places like uh burger king and mcdonalds they had salads you know ya lah but i may not going to go all the way there to have fast food i don't even have fast food here in singapore well ya but then no i'm thinking of like i don't know lah probably see how see how i won't do it i know i know probably now i'm gonna to talk about it right when i get i'm not gonna do anything wait eat out all the time because you know i'm i'm sure you you'll find that it's so difficult to juggle time because you firstly you got to iron clothes you got to laundry your clothes no i'm not going to iron i think just look grungy lor look grungy all the time no hey you got to study as well you got to go for your lessons and i think you got to go shopping for food there's lots of things you'll be doing and you just don't have that many hours is it unless all right you are living on campus itself i'm living near campus well if you are living near campus okay but i wasn't living near campus it took me about half an hour to reach college oh mine mine is just three minutes walking time you see so it's different it's not like when i was in college if i could cook all the time because you know it was i was just five minutes walk from college you see know what i mean aiyah see how see how don't know what my schedule is gonna be like so when i was in london this year it was like it was too packed you see the time was too much okay okay even though it's like quite suspicious but why why okay if you are getting money from some shouldn't they be happy about it that you're not asking money from them no because they think i've been up to no good recently you see they think i'm being kept actually really ah that's quite that's quite an accomplishment what don't you think so well i would think so but they don't think so obviously i mean aiyah so they they question me recently about you know those thing my my sis question me recently why aren't i coming back you know because is it because of someone and so or or is it because of you know what and what i just told you it's because of the freedom i get over there which is true no why have you not been coming home in in singapore  no no because i want to stay there to stu uh work you see oh they don't want oh i see and they're getting very suspicious you see aiyah really but it's your life you know ultimately where you gonna end up it's isn't it i mean you got to live your life what true that's but that's the difference between your family and my family upbringing you see i mean i know my parents were sort of talk talking about me eventually but it seems somehow they sort of know that it's it's there is distinct possibility you're coming down probably not be coming back not so soon anyway lah you know what i mean 
Singapore	what did you what did you think about it i think i never expected it to happen you know because uh i always thought to myself that the mrt was perfectly safe and all that but i was so surprised to hear that that you know it actually crashed okay and there's a good thing that it crashed at the station and one of the trains was stationary stationary that's right but that shouldn't happen if the train is stationary why should the uh moving train you know collide into i think the time-table must have got mixed up maybe one train was the the the the first train was slower and second train was faster you know so somehow or rather word  happen 'cause it's quite frequent right the mrt yes i think in morning it's about three minutes intervals or something enough to crash word probably so boon did you take the mrt to work i mean to to i stay at eusoff college and there's a shuttle bus service i see i see well i don't take the mrt i take the bus so but i take the mrt home oh now you be with so hopefully it it will resume its service when at about five o'clock you think people will lose faith in the mrt now that this has happened i don't think so i think i think it there must be some some reason behind colli collision it cannot happen just all of a sudden like probably there will be a big investigation like word i'm sure there will when the the cable-car actually came down at sentosa there was this big in inquest right ya so probably the same is gonna happen now yes yes but luckily it was i mean one of the train was stationary i'm sure the the impact of collision may not have been very bad probably many of the people on on the train were students at nus because it happened at clementi in the morning you know i suppose ya but then the the the train was suppose to be heading towards jurong ya exactly so so probably more workers rather than students but it stopped at clementi you see so that means the students haven't got down yet so probably oh do they normally go to clementi station ya many many students go to clementi especially if they're from arts or from engineering right i see i see ya so probably lot of nus students involve in that crash there do you know they're gonna have it on tv at three o'clock this afternoon you mean it has become a some like some celebrity not cele word  i think they they they they promise a a kind of a report on tv so at three o'clock this afternoon there'll be there'll be two telecast one on channel eight and one on channel five so it's it's almost three o'clock now maybe we can get hold of if we can get hold of a tv we can listen in and see what's what has what actually happen this morning right right priscilla do you play any sports ah ya i i play squash and right now i'm trying to learn tennis with a friend of mine who is teaching me oh how how often do you play tennis tennis uh not very often when he's free uh then he'll teach me you see so uh okay what about squash do you play squash very often oh now i don't it's hard to get hold of a partner to play ya partner who's about the same level as you not too bad not too good you know that sort of thing what about facilities uh i try to go over to ie uh rather college of physical education because it's just across the road from where i stay eusoff college eusoff college ya do you have to pay to get in there unfortunately yes but usually we can also you know just go there if there's nobody using it's it's quite alright ya are are you very good at squash uh i'm not on the squash ladder or anything but uh just recreational play ya just recreational play what about yourself doctor chui i i don't play any i i do i used to play tennis and and the squash as well but because it's difficult it's difficult to find a partner who is who who's on the same level as you in in the case of tennis you find that if if you get a very good player you you find that you you picking up balls most of the time so now i i i i in my spare time i run a lot jogging and so on i'm still thinking considering whether i should participate in the end of year marathon oh the one up mount kinabalu is it no no no no it this is organised by mobil the annual marathon singapore marathon twenty-three k forty-six kilometres oh okay so i'm still considering very hard whether i should put in the the registration form but have you actually run such a distance before i have done a half marathon uh a few years ago that's about twenty-three or thirteen miles thirteen miles miles thirteen miles that wasn't too bad you mean you managed you did not walk i did not walk yes i i did run all the way didn't have to walk at all any ranking no no just a like you uh uh like you i'm just a recreational runner so uh you don't play any other racket games at all not so much racket games no just running only just mainly running ah how about swimming swimming occasionally you know when when i when i uh when it's too hot then i just think i'll just go for a dip not not so much like a serious you know no i don't swim laps so okay what what styles do you swim well breast-strokes or or free-style well i don't i i won't consider that really very serious swimming it's just like taking a dip taking a dip right okay i'm i'm a pretty serious swimmer i would say oh really i mean if i go into the pool i would like do laps you know and how many laps do you do uh maybe twenty twenty laps ya that's very good free-style twenty laps no uh breast-stroke but it's difficult to actually swim in pools because there are so many people there people keep banging into you that's right that's right ya so it's not very easy to actually swim laps i used to swim swim laps too but i find it uh uh like you say sometimes it's very crowded ya that's right it is very crowded in the pool but it's it's so nice to actually run and then swim you know i don't whether you tried that before you you maybe you run about i don't know how many k i i run about two k then i'll go back change and go down for a for a swim for a dip ya it's really refreshing have you considered the biathlon no as i said i ought you can swim and run but i think that swimming is usually done in the sea right the triathlon ya but there there there are different ways of i think some some organisations have the swim in swimming pools and they have done that before oh i see i object to swimming in the sea because uh i don't think it's very safe many accidents have happened in singapore and uh overseas as well i suppose if you're a strong swimmer you don't have to worry about that i'm a swimming pool swimmer not a not a sea swimmer that's very that's very aiyah i understand what you meant it's very different swimming in the pool and swimming in the sea because in the sea they've got currents and wave and all these stuff so it it can really put you off ya true anyway it's just for fun lah swimming and running and all these it's just for fun not not not very serious about it actually ya i i also actually teach aerobics presently oh do you ya ya ya where do you do that in eusoff college i'm actually taking a class uh once a week once a week and what kind of aerobics do you do high impact low impact step i'm trying to teach them high impact but uh the they are not that very fit right now but i think they will improve with time i see are you certified no you're not i'm not but i know i know how to do jane fonda's complete workout quite well with my eyes closed put it that way ya i see because i have been watching the video and doing it for about more than a year oh and i used to take classes in nus as well as outside oh do you ya i used to so now i'm trying to teach them as a favour actually not because i i'm committed to it but as a favour because they want to learn i see i used to take a a few aerobic classes myself too oh i see where where about did you well i i i've join this uh club outside so what type of aerobics oh well all sorts low-high high-low step step as well step is is pretty fun ya that's what i heard but i don't have you tried that no i haven't tried it because they they only teach it outside they don't they don't have it in nus in nus no i mean i stop going to the rhythmics club i see ya but the nus uh uh aerobics is actually uh ya quite is quite tough you know the regiment is is this conducted by students or instructed from outside students i see ya and uh but it's not bad you know a lot of guys come as well and really ya and you can see them panting and puffing as well so that i know that i don't feel guilty when i do that then actually step is quite fun but when i still remember very first step class and uh it's not that easy initially because you you you really have to concentrate on what the instructress's doing and it it it has to be you cannot think too much you just have to do it you step up and down the the bench and you you cannot concentrate i mean you cannot really uh if you if you try to think too much you you you get confused and you can't follow the class anymore so it it depends very much on on your spontaneity so you just have to do it but it's really fun it it it it's really fun and uh it can be very high intensity too you can really pant a lot and it depends on how many steps you take if you if you you can for beginners you start with just one bench one step then you promote you progress on to two steps on the other hand jane fonda's workout it's it's really fun because uh it's it's a dance workout as well ya so it's like that there's cha cha there rock n' roll and uh there's country uh so it's it's really interesting scottish dance and all that really scottish but i've seen a programme i've seen a video tape once but probably it's a different one different tape i i i if i've not mistaken she has a few tapes she does i think there's a there's one which is quite interesting the lean routine uh it also involving like modern jazz ballet you see  i see quite interesting actually but i suppose that's more for girls the guys will not they usually have guys in the video as well 
Singapore	what is the other dish you want i was thinking of luncheon meat you know this one you took it out ah actually this one is or this no need maybe half lah but actually is a waste you know because this one is big this is quite big different size prawn and well i can put some pork instead put in a waste uh you use ya i i'll put some pork for the ca cauliflower lor instead of the prawns don't know lah you can use all half lah half lah even the beans uh are hard then luncheon meat ah wei ha luncheon meat ah how do you want to do it fry ah ah okay lor i've not eaten for very long you fry the luncheon meat first lah because i need time to cut up the beans you need time i do the cooking lah i thought of a dish you cook one dish you can cook for the rest of the week ee so dirty how much cauliflower did you buy also around there maybe smaller piece okay let's test this thing whether it works or not if not switch for so long it doesn't work ya aye what are you doing aye i fry i fry okay you have to hang hang if you send send her out of the kitchen ah there won't any noise leh you hang around there do some work wash the dishes assist me in cooking well open the can open the can okay this one do you want to word ah give me a bowl actually i'm full lah after the curry puff please wash the bowl ee you know today ah gregory said if you can uh bring two three million of this new business why not go ahead i'll support you you know of course so he said you carve your own niche whatever kind of loans you want to do but i'm afraid lah how start from where start from the branches i don't know how could the branch endorse that he don't want the person to be too good also why because he won't need you he'll say get lost i'm meeting my target's fine maybe have to call kenneth aye so few ah how can lah what else aye actually i don't like that black bean fish you know you don't ah very stiff one the fish i like ah i i i mean can't eat it all the time but occasionally i like that fish has been selling very well my father likes it very much but i don't really like but that ah you can't put in the microwave you know what what the fish because it's gets harder and harder and then you can't eat it then steam ah ya you you have to try to ee uh you have to try finish it no but the first time round you gotta heat it up oh just put in here lor microwave lah not very good but it's got a very good pan lah can lah it's okay lah microwave excuse me can you go somewhere else my mum used to fry this with what eggs you want to kah up everything no you can't finish word  i think it's good for sandwiches ya by the way finish off the corn beef you alone i like leh i don't like i like corn beef you know i didn't tell my sister i don't like <aye you know what gregory said today what i told you right the table that i prepared and then he didn't see that he just ask me to make a copy for the rest of them and then he didn't keep a copy for himself ya ah so today ah i just joking said you know no no he said he ask me uh where is your table ah i've been waiting for very long the thing's that i showed it to you what at a meeting that day he say ya but i want a copy for myself then i was wondering why you took so long so i said but all of us thought you didn't want to keep a copy you know oh then he say then i i said as i was quite hurt that after i put in so much effort you don't want a copy then he said oh no no no no no don't misunderstand i want it then he said oh next time if you clear our set you must tell me you know aye he has a lot of experience leh you know he was with the main branch leh for one year as a cadet officer then subsequently he join bedok branch as second officer second officer is something like assistant manager ah ha then after he was posted to a few other branches to set up new branches like world trade centre world trade centre is one of highest profit-making branches so eventually they posted him back to retail banking head office ah to clear up the mess he said everywhere he went ah is the best is a new challenge and he he feels very slippery one you know but he still made it and he just have to do it you know so he said actually a lot of thing he's not very happy with it he he just bear with them like having he just have to live with it having to start from so many ya i think after you have done well increases your confidence and you don't feel wah you know jumpy and all that that's why in the us ah there are lot of people there're special specialise in turn around situation they told me you know something is wrong then they go in they are company doctor or or when the company is doing well and all that ah wah they got no role for themselves ah they're good in problem solving but they're not good in uh you know planning ahead improving on what is a really good you know oh we have too many fruits you know aye the nectarines are not nice ah how ah so many left i don't mind eating them but i can't finish it's quite big which one is it don't know sufficient or not ha this luncheon meat aye must buy this one nah the oyster sauce you want me to cut up more oh i think enough lah only two of us so it does seem that there is quite a lot of scope for you ah ya not really tied down to one function forever he he told me he wants to train me uh in product development as well so that i have a wider scope you know ya he said at the end of the day he wants uh most of us lah to have experience in credit processing means credit checking and then marketing to the new roles and product planning then he said the new guy that might be coming in will do another major product so i'll be with jasmine it seems that product quite a lot of work uh it is a very active product i mean the club fifty-five plus he organise a lot of things for the old folks you know and the take up rate is very good of course because it is an on-going aye it's a growth market you know we have more and more people ageing ah and i tell you one secret ah not secret lah one bonus points for us is that oub is very close to cpf board and if you want to withdraw you know when you reach fifty-five years you can withdraw ex excess uh over the minimum sum and can only withdraw at oub not any other local banks you know through oub ah only oub you come to oub you with the cpf statement stating how much you have in excess over your minimum sum then we'll give you a cashier's order or cash and then at that point in time of course they will sell oh why don't deposit into our account so we are the only bank given that right right ya and because of our linkage with cpf board ah we have access to all the data-base you know i thought that is confidential cannot be confidential lah because we are the paying agent nah we we have to have the dividends also and we make use of that lah to send direct mailers it's a growing lah ya that's why jasmine has to work sort of like full-time you know on this product and cut time on the the credit procession aye you don't want to cut into half ah oh oh for me in this size is is okay normally i like to cut into half ya then cut lor these two for me ah hor the rest i cut it's easier to fry also because the burnt corners that's the differences that we have are you meeting that phuah fellow on friday ah tentatively lah okay lor anyway only thursday ah he may not turn up also ai ya no lah not that he won't turn up he may cancel it i think he's he's okay sounds like he got lot of things to tell me this is a lot i must make courtesy we haven't cook i must make courtesy calls to your edb people ah why if they have any companies that come to them for help uh i'm sure when you were there did any company come to you and ask you how to go about making a loan no they they they know i mean that that basic things they know i mean if they can't let government know do you recommend any banks also no we're not supposed to oh oh because we maybe you know accuse of favoritism so by big six consulting we are not supposed to leh although we know that that the manager very well and he's supposed to be quite cool lah we are not supposed to because they can come around and and and say that aye you say that lah then we'll be in trouble aye you have not cook the rice lah ha the rice ya lah i have to get excuse never mind never mind i do lah oh then how i think ah there's no need lah because because most companies they do know how to go to the bank they don't need to come to edb and then they say ya lah but they don't come to me leh you know i feel like handling the hot-line i'm better at tele-marketing don't know lah maybe i'll ask maybe you go the branch first and to take a look what's the situation so because back in dbs through the hot-line you pull in a lot of customers you know especially housing loans aye ya hot-line is handled by the girls but they can ref they can pass the phone to me if they have housing loan and apartments actually housing loan you need a more officer ya they should will definitely ask oh what is your financial term do we need evaluation from you they need all this what you didn't switch on or what  interruption  the pickup rate

quiet like waiting for my voice and where i try to pretend to be my voice that i used to lah then he'll say hello i can recognise his voice instantly it's one of a kind one i mean he can so patient so many years do nothing say nothing not every time but there will come a period where he will start calling i tell you years you know since secondary two until last year i i tell you i can't believe this it's drop word value lah if you don't want to spend and he ever ask me uh luckily uh when i was young i was careful he say would you like to come to my house to watch video tape uh you masturbate for me i masturbate for you at that time i didn't know what is masturbation you know because i only started when i was in the army that means uh half way through about a  word then then i started i never tried before so at that time i didn't know what's was indication and after that was when i met this guy uh in river valley swimming pool that famous place is a haven heaven for heaven for but it's tracked down already right aye that guy i read the papers tracked down touch me you know touch me know try to in the pool ah i suppose i got away uh no no in his car in the car in the car i thought he's a nice guy offer to drive me you see oh i was young then so when he touch me i said okay that's the last i want to see you i just slam the door and how old were you then secondary school fourteen sec three i think so that guy uh macho you know macho bodybuilder stay in a pri private house drives a car that's why i was this guy got experience always uh some phobia many times i was the one i mean you got this kind of experience people thought i gay uh word always come and approach me i'm a ugly looking chap of course  word shorts lah hey i want word you so much handsome my name is richard word  where's everybody so how aye for this type of people you should uh throw him off report to police station ya i mean no this type person you should tell him off straight very very commanding otherwise he won't turn off one this sort of people aye can i use your this ya go ahead go ahead i i seldom use powder ya what about i mean when was the last time no i in college i always think that he is quite macho lah although but a gentle macho lah then but i mean  word why not change already maybe he's more open to it do you know that when i was in r j ah you know r j right we have o g group o g right orientation groups and i come from outram you see so those r i guys ah will clique and you know uh nee soon or this guy is damn rich lah and he and a few uh always you know r

damn one i'm those kind who no friends is okay i can settle on my own i'm a i'm a loner you see so but hee ya was ee ming was very nice he he talked to me he was very nice to me know can drink ya go ahead but did you suspect anything never i never i was only you mean he tried to no never never it's just that i at least i know he's very word i never think that he's word until i  word him in performing ah maybe i i i guess i'm being too harsh to jump into to suspect that he's gay but one thing is for sure it's he's a bit you know he's a bit by the way word question if you know one of the word right how would you if he respect me i mean lets say he's not interested in you know lah i mean let's say he's not your type lah you know i will only treat him as a friend  word  there is nothing wrong to remain as friends as long is that he doesn't it is easy to say that it is easy to say that you know what i mean a lot of people will react as well i don't know i also don't know sometimes i imagine ah how and word i have values that shall we word a e how would i how would you react i was i was telling myself what should what would i do the thing about aids word  ya  word world wide i mean world wide i mean of course it changes lah now it is ecological you know why i mean i word  partly because the problem is no longer a western  word  it becomes a word  no longer of the of the developing world lah and because the problem started from the west right doesn't it doesn't no it kind of started from africa ya but it is like transported because of some western values you see so the thing is whether that problem uh has become a international thing and so definitely you mean to say the culprit is now the west that is why word  i think so you see it is no longer a it is it's it's no longer a western thing you know a lot of americans have aids you get what i mean now is that a lot of thais have aids because of what yes yes yes you know i know what you mean and you can't say it is because of the thais themselves someone must have forced it in order to under to accept that right you also accept responsibility of course so i would rather not talk about it 
Singapore	and then after there's the tea ceremony that's at your home ya who's that no that's that's someone from geography department so they pang the pang teh would be at about four four pm or four-thirty at my place what's happening to church ceremony are they singing or something they're going to sing then the bride's coming in then they're going to say word  together are they no they don't there's no performance or anything in the church itself the last few weddings i've been to don't know what they're like whose wedding lilian's wedding but no one sang for them yes no they had a duet oh they sang together don't you remember they didn't sing peng ling and her husband sang right ya is that right ya like who or was it that no i i remember peng nan sang for peng nan and the wife as well oh ya ya ya that's true that's nice because they're so sporting but uhm geraldine doesn't want to sing and yen has a a wedding is not the to be sporting that's true and yen is tone deaf also tone deaf oh so he claims so but is anybody in the church singing for them uh no they don't want anything so no one is gonna to do anything i won't be mcing anything at all in the wedding in the church you're definitely not the the bestman there's no bestman and there's no bride's maid either oh doesn't she have a sister or something yes but they don't want bride's maid and best man what's strange also is they want to break tra tradition in so many ways that it's so ridiculous like like what they said that they don't want anyone to stand up when the bride comes in so everyone will be seated when the bride comes in but then you you know unless you specifically tell oh they're no they're gonna specifically tell people that oh because otherwise some will stand up and some would sit down ya so he would say uhm can you please sit down for the bride the bride and groom specifically ask that you sit down for the why uh geraldine said she doesn't want uh whenever people stand up people will be like trying to look at the bride and then a lot of people won't see if you sit down everyone has an equal opportunity to see her anyway so well i suppose there's some logic in there well and then they showed me their wedding photos on last oh well last week and her evening gown she said that she took the best of everything maybe word she went through the whole catalogue then she said i like the bodies of this i like the sleeve of that i like the skirt of that came out looking so terrible oh you seen it it's not she herself even said aiyah now that it's combine it looks very sloppy because if you noticed all that peng ling is so all body hugging right ya ya ya and if you're slim that's quite nice that's okay in it she is slim but her dress came up looking like it's very soft and flowy here it's very soft and flowy below so it becomes so she looks fluffer than she is ah she it looks very wishy-washy you know so it's not nice so what to do but her her wedding gown is quite quite her wedding gown is nice ya it's very nice how how do you know you saw photos i saw when it was hanging in your room for like in a week before you came back in my room ya how come oh her dress was hanging in my room ya her dress was hanging in your room do you think she was hanging in your room no i i thought her photo was hanging there no the the dress is hanging there okay we went went to visit ah ma and then always nosing  word  if i nose into your room just in case you came back you didn't tell me oh the evening gown is the same colour as the wedding gown it's white off-white so it's the same so so you don't like her dress looks not very that did your brother make i'm sure he did he no he didn't make he just bought it ah okay lah just bought ya brown in colour which i didn't think was very appropriate colour brown i thought at least it has to be charcoal blue or something or some or grey or something quite nice eh that's true and you you're making a suit no same stuff one one i already have so what about your mother what is she going to like has she planned something she's deliberating what if she can bruise three days for one two days ya she might wear i don't like that dress what what is that i think it word  what is that it's sort of crushed velvet you know it's not suitable for older people what colour is it uhm terrible looks like a word  it's sort of violet and green it's tight and very short oh short it's not a long dress no it's not long short as in how short well short for me knee okay ya i mean it's short for an older person right so is it grand or what i mean it's i don't like it don't like it i don't like it so tell her not wear but you see i my father of course being the indulgent person he's oh so oh you look young you look young it just because you wear something a young person wears do not make you no no i feel that it's not it's it's quite fun sort of outfit but you know this is the wedding and  word  ya ya ya anyway i i don't i i hope she wears some another one it's black in colour and it's long okay for me at least probably she's she's si kor right oh your brother called last night my mom thought was you for for what call for what i think regarding the car oh ya ya ya he wants to word it so when when are we getting the car friday we'll be sending it over on friday okay ya and then you can decorate it oh geraldine's mother is going to decorate it but uhm we're going to test drive it because the other person has never driven a car that sort of car before it's three fifty or three hundred or five hundred it's just three hundred sdl okay but the l bit makes it a bit harder to drive because it's long oh l it's long ya oh okay okay anyway uhm what was that now my mother not my mother sa khor called up and then to tell me what she's going to wear she said her church wear is gonna be green with gathers here then she said no lah it'll not too much gathers because i don't want it to add to my waist i'll tell there's much more to add into it so she said don't she doesn't want that uh to add to her waist then church no for dinner itself is what is it now oh it's a very nice dress that you can i can imagine her fingers going why was she ringing up to tell you something like that no i was talking about a lot of things oh a lot of things and this was just part of the conversation so and you say you gonna wear black i don't know i was i feel it's too formal very lau very lau you know in in singapore no it's here but it's black velvet and it's off no no no wear that it'll be nice but i know what you singaporeans don't take weddings that seriously ya but as family but then i don't i don't want to look like some stupid dressed up witch word  no i think most of the family members are gonna dress up well my mum is certainly gonna dress quite a lot so just wear it lah i mean how often do you get to wear it ave you worn it before i've never worn it before see but i i'm bringing it as formal attire to word just in case you have to in front of the word  okay topic number two awful we haven't entirely exhausted it either okay what else are you gonna talk about the wedding what are you wearing i'm just going to exactly that i bought what your speech you said you gonna show me it's uhm we have all the parts already oh present word that oh no need i'll i'll come i'll ought to read it out to show you how how it sounds and if you feel it's not very good then you will you can add by the way this is a wedding speech okay okay alright i'm gonna start with good evening ladies and gentlemen on this historical day the twenty-eight day of august nineteen ninety-three two significant events were solemnised singaporeans elected a new president wee that's that's national twenty-eight polling oh okay okay and of course the more significant of the two events the wedding of kao yen and geraldine then my cousin would say in many ways these events are similar one person has been elected to lead the nation the other has been elected to head a new family then i'll come in and say and i'm sure geraldine must be thrilled with her power and responsibility and then we'll on this is just an introduction okay alright the interlude i won't word the interlude do your song and dance is it no no no in the interlude we're going to talk about how the bride and groom met one another oh are you where they met one another and what they saw in one another those typical corny sort of thing but we're going to by the way you surely invited word  of course not you know what liang wanted to say how did yen meet up with geraldine then someone will say by dumping shirley why don't you do that cannot no you are ah ma's spy network she says that yuen is still seeing shirley no not at all they see her accidentally in the bus because she how how did she you told me she is quite frantic about being dumped and replaced ya but now there's nothing she's more controlled now is it ya that's good i was afraid she's about to turn up with a chopper and okay what what did ah ma's spy say i don't know where ah ma so my my mom said oh word i said who told you this then she said ah ma then i said how does ah ma know okay what did okay what did ah ma say ah ma says that uhm uh when you all go out or something like that uhm yuen will whisper whisper on the phone oh you use her phone for a start to that's that's why i asked you about how does ah ma okay but whisper can be whispering to anyone ya ya ya to anyone and uh ah ma says oh why should he have to use my phone uhm why should he have to whisper if it's so my father said why can't it be geraldine right maybe he's whispering sweet-nothings or something like so that's why i said the spy network is entirely faulty awful dreadful woman do you know grandmother is dreadful she's absolutely awful i mean she's like she doesn't wish you well at all she no no the worst thing is in front of everyone she's so sweet and benign right  ya ya ya right and if and all these sort of things behind 
Singapore	so when visitors come how is it do you have problems with them no i think is i mean your time is spent because of the whole week you know like in this case when joe is in town and being so called cbg and now that i'm word and kelvin is not around all the meetings you know and all the discussion word  i mean what are you discussing budget concern your budget your plan for next year that you meet the budget you know if your why is your budget so much your growth is not or not very high you know it's the same case lah every boss word or you know is are interested in their own areas all they care for is their areas you know like ben nah ben lam who'll be interested for biotech did he have meeting with you not really he did ben doesn't really sit down meeting with me in the sense that but he did ask me after the budget review yesterday count the numbers lah you know whether i'm confident that i'll achieve those figures and how about looking into the other areas and all that how do you find this boss are they good uhm some some of them are not much help but so far keith chan uh seem to be okay i mean quite helpful in that sense you know but ben i don't not not really ben lam lah can't really said depend on him or what but keith seem to be quite okay but he's too new know what i mean got to wait and see how it it goes and uh what he says whether he claims that he would help out you know whether he'll do it what what do you mean what kind of thing would they do for for you all you see what they are saying now uh we don't liaise direct with the us you know we should liaise with the bum but sometimes it's quite difficult certain issue i go to him he has to go back to the international people so sometimes end up we'll be writing a fax lah we see if we write to the international people we cc them we cc our boss you know so many people but why what's the rationale for for you know having them coordinate for you all them you see them they were supposed to look into areas like uhm maybe more of market development market opportunities and all i mean they are supposed to be uh specialised in their area and they go and look into ways that help us to increase our plan or programmes you know increase increase our sales and all that lah ya then they're supposed in a way to coordinate for us instead of us going to the us and say you know instead they're the only one that contact the us office or whatever but why why did you say it's not working it's not working out that well because sometimes certain issue they can't to re they can't help us to resolve like what price issue or what most areas of price issue that we have free hand as long as we we know our standard course we can work on it you know the only deviation so far that i'm working with uh that controls our price to our distributors uh customers in thailand they control it because in the first place their demand is greater than supply and it's true so you know they get the best they want a higher price other countries are willing to pay some of our asia pacific countries uh south asia ah are not willing we can't afford to pay that high so end up you can't sell right ya you can't get the goods you may if that's the case how to set a budget if if the us quotes that way no man in his then us sake the rest of you will say you can make this price then we supply there's a minimum price lah you have to have a minimum price lah i mean no doubt we know it's quality product but it depends on individual country status you know whether can they afford to pay that amount of money so sometimes quite difficult for us you know what if they work that way what's the point of setting a budget  word uh no i mean you that's the base lah that means that's your asb then you know with this amount of price how much you can sell then you work on it lah then you get a budget lah but if later what you bid for it you won't get it no no once no that's right they have this in this case like highland word issue they have cater allocate you with the thing so you let's say they ask you for a minimum price and we agreed okay our customers are willing to accept the minimum price then they uh they ask how much quantity you want and you tell them this is the quantity you want then if they can locate you the full amount they give you the full amount that means will be allocated quantities to you at this price then that's it no even if let's say in word in later stage uh other countries are willing to pay higher they cannot give my allocated quantity to them in that sense you see but once i've agreed to this price during the budgeting time i'll if my i'm allocated this quantity this quantity will be for me lah but of course if i can't sell this quantity then there's another issue lah that means i didn't raise my budget you see uhm get what i mean if i get can sell it i'll get it lah you know if i can sell at this price i'll get it lah so that would mean before you uh present your budget you actually have to strike an agreement with them they come up with us it's only in highland we do this is only highland because it's an exceptional case in the sense that sometimes you don't have uhm but actually supply is i mean demand is greater than supply but certain other products too have a minimum like price but most of the other places they don't they have a recommended price in that sense that to sell it to your distributors or whatever you see then it's up to you lah whether you how much issue you wanna make you see thailand is only exception like just now when we're talking about the endoscope that we are the only one with the endoscope i mean it's such a rare that one they only have five for the let say they're talking about manufacturing only five for the whole world additional month that's like you know allocation you know see who the gotta see who is the they even choose whom to give the price the the sell the scope to so they want somebody who is of uh can have act as a reference centre you know and all that so not everybody who wants it can get it in this case endo endoscope is this the the fifth newest product no cbd products lis products what if i say don't more than heart wanna open companies can go in and sees like camera okay ya but why is it an open heart thing for this only an open heart surgery why they make so few capacity and all that word  it seems that the scope is not the issue it's the the catitus that they use to put with the scope it's like they have collection capacity problem is it but like they only make five sets to sell every year i don't know how many sets lah but they have like restricted quantities ya so miserable uhm how can we meet our sales target hah how was henry's presentation do you know i don't know he seen and came out and tell me i said how was it oh have to increase another two hundred dollars obviously you know where i ask him where's that money gonna come from look's like i just contributed another hundred thousand terrible just like the other time when after the first review came back ah he said oh we have to increase further says that the growth wasn't satisfactory and ask kelvin and myself to look into our area and susan and the best part is kelvin increase the area under where cbg area which he's handing to me so that's why in the end what henry says was you know kelvin has still got to share the responsibility you know of the budget figures for next year because all those budget figures was put up by him this is priya word always on leave who is henry always on leave henry ah of course they don't the last two months was because you know a lot of arrangement going up to malaysia because of ben's visit and all that but this one because he's going to have ex exam oh william also and mee uh for tomorrow priya is also on leave oh it's a bad time for them uh you know what happen today we went for lunch who joe and fu leong two of us three of us in the tanin restaurant in amara joe paid thai restaurant thai so joe paid for it you know how much tip he gave the guy ten dollars twenty-one bucks sing sing i mean you work on ten or fifteen per cent you see then i told him joe by the way you know after he sign after all he's from us he's sign already then he say why didn't you tell me this i said we didn't know you gonna give twenty-one dollars so we told him normal in the practice here is we normally don't encourage giving tips because it's already service charge you see matthew word he told him anyway if you want to give normally you a dollar or two just give a few you know maybe five bucks the very most i said well never mind the next time you come to this restaurant they'll treat you pretty well so that that waiter must be smiling and smiling ya in fact when we went there they told us oh really you know surprisingly it was quite empty but it was all reserved you know wow they they told us no place i know i i heard the food is very good no bad lah but later joe was complaining of the portion this is miserable portion it's meant for a child eats uh he eats a lot you see then he told us there's no place then the lady said oh if you don't mind it's directly under the air duct you know air vent so it's very cold and say you can see the weather it's cold because it was raining she said do you mind i said oh it doesn't matter we don't really mind because you know fu leong and him won't mind the cold first they are all so big and is alice word  perspiring anyway you all eating hot food ya that's why joe said doesn't matter that's why joe was trying his luck there being thai does it help can i get being thai does it help what to get a place he said that too he say for our own thai people can i get a place does he speak thai ya he speaks thai very fluently yes surprising you know i'm surprise ya so far it appears to me no this when you compare to the americans the chinese-born or asian-born americans are even more polite  well good manners uh true compared to the real americans definitely tak boleh tahan them true they're such snobs when they come to our office i mean i could see that even when joe talks to roger roger also is very rude rude i mean like no respect for the other person no how does he respond to people heh just yell at him or what just yell lah he told him something on top of his voice you know what i mean because nobody tells him off 
Singapore	ya so you were saying how bored you were ya that's a little well you can call me next after june but i am a like afraid you see you'll be well i'll be disturbing it's all right i mean i can

communications no then uhm either international relations or international communications i thought international communications will be more what does that entail what is international communications you know communications it is a it's it's like two disciplines lah inter-disciplinary so you do international relations combine with communications then it speeds up like mass communications that kind of thing something like that lah but i i don't like what it means lah i only just saw it so i'm gonna try find out more about the field so how are thing did you manage to see adrian adrian doesn't

little jam thing a little orange peel so there is a bit of wine too in it oh that was the desert you know what happen yesterday what i was supposed to go and see michael jackson right and then he cancelled on us but did you go of course i was there oh dear he cancelled you mean he cancelled the performance no he postpone it to wednesday night no wednesday is cancelled too really that's what sok cheng said because uhm the police uhm refuse to give authorisation serious aye wednesday no uhm michael jackson show ah cancelled what do you word there so maybe oh okay don't know why why why is it cancelled because the police already put in so much manpower for the thing they were complaining about putting in more shit but then what's going but this is hear say this is hear say so wait for the newspapers tomorrow get refund lah see yesterday i could have been out with you all you know i was sitting there okay with my mum but then my mum was talking to nicolette rappa naturally lah you know my mum just talks to anybody ya then nicolette said i'll be here on wednesday but i'll be late she has to be at the istana do you have fixed seats ya pink seats it's a hundred and eighty-five dollar front row wow yes right in front of the stage yes i still have the tickets wanna see in front of stage no front row hundred and eighty-five dollars the frontest i mean the most front is the two hundred dollars so yours is just behind mine is behind the two hundred dollars not so bad this is my ticket stub so are you on the field or are you up there on the field no because i think the grand stand is hundred and twenty-five dollars also ha why don't you sit opposite the grand stand it's always that is where were sitting ya we did the view was pretty good is it you sat opposite the grand stand ya on the other side lah michael jackson was about this big is it ya can still see him we can still see him but i go in and then i see all these people who look like ants they're so small on the gallery you know what i mean and then aye can you imagine i manage to find them don't you think that she is very lucky you know ya she can say go there and meet and then thousands of people are there and she manages to find them crazy how did you do it got fed up i sat down then i saw my friends walking by fortunately they were going to the toilet so it was a good thing how are you feeling today i think better lah i i aiyah but will this go in or not so you did manage to talk to the man lah ya i went to talk to the man and he was positive about it ya he was positive good he did say what to do if she doesn't want to supervise do another topic he was very nonchalant lah so all the better lah it's not according to him ya i said if you want to leave leave in a state of grace compose your you know compose yourself and leave i mean no lah shop for another topic another supervisor you must change topic ah ask him to stop talking to elliot ha i think i would i would you should have been with us yesterday we ate so much know and then i hate michael jackson didn't he come out and sing at all he didn't he didn't i thought he came out and perform then he fainted no nonsense he fainted even before the concert so flop he fainted meh he fainted really ya why due to migraine he is so weak he probably thai weather so hot lah singapore weather too hot for him no he probably didn't bring forgot to bring his oxygen chamber along that's why he fainted and people come from johore and there was this girl who suddenly word  too bad lah she came all the way from johore okay to watch some even flew in from jarkarta from like from penang i think he is so bloody inconsiderate serious you know he is the most inconsiderate superstar ya my mum said she he played everyone out now thousands of people out i said ya if you are famous enough you get so is your mum gonna go with you on wednesday if it does happen i don't think so honestly if you were at the performance yesterday but at least you have fixed seats not so bad you didn't go like how many hours can imagine we have people who line up in the morning and then when cancel oh boy if i had to line up oh please what will happen moral of the story don't always go for the first concerts usually don't mess up so much then how about the bangkok one they cancelled the second one they cancelled the second the subsequent ones who wants to insure michael jackson then everybody is so frighten of insuring his concerts then isn't it ya i mean who wants to go now people will still go i mean we should all boycott ya to start a movement or something ya boycott michael jackson and this is not his first time he has been cancelling it in europe and japan and so on but some people are very against it but why what if somebody else do it no more sales no but then isn't he's risking his reputation he doesn't care he has really enough money to live so why does care but i think these are just to boost uh cds sales or something ya it's all publicity stunts so it's not a money-making thing that he's out here for the concert i don't think he makes very much out of concerts it's sponsored by pepsi why not pepsi's paying still doesn't affect him what and then if he cancels out because ultimately they word it they don't have to like pay compensation you know they just have to re refund because there is always you know insure uh guys ah who insure the whole concert for don't know what what what but i don't think they'll i think they'll only like uhm pay the organisers or something i don't think concerts goers like if you ask for a refund they will just give you the basic your basic refund not a not compensation right they don't lose out 
Singapore	your your group ah anyone finish their a e so many a lot a lot of people finish already ya that is they are short of binding lah never bind yet at most ah final maybe final touches then how about your group your group ya me i'm the very slowly one no your group not only you how about others ah a lot of people finish already your group leh my group meaning what what group the ones in our core ah your discussion group nobody has finished rest assured our group all very slow they're all slow coaches i think you're wasting tape not mine tape is not mine they gave it to you ah ya this one ah it's not my tape how many have you done so far hah how many have you done so far this is the only one so i mean you need oh a pioneer set ah each one do one only is it ya this one i have to return seok mee and this one consider as ah for word tutorial ah interesting i'll tape the class lor who came up with this the department quite stupid lar not very well done ya they should know the answers what so stupid want to meet my doctor like you see doctor i mean if go and see chinese sin seh i mean y i h eh i only talk in hokkien than and furthermore uh our target is not only grads is it hokkien there is those who huh not only grads ya also this one not only grads no but the thing is indonesia you can see the middle age ya middle-age man the thing is eh if for example like grads eh you do not touch on the more common areas you know things like baby life kind of thing just hawker centres and restaurants that's it and taxis as you take taxi every day no they just want to know what language what language you use more commonly they should have asked what language we use when we slot the coin into the you know sometimes ah depends on the bus driver they ask kwe lui of course you answer ngoh kak what but normally we won't say how much we just show ya or they they usually don't ask either no sometimes they can't see you see the coin is hidden or some so they will ask i think they ask in hokkien you go and answer in english ah then not very nice they don't like it i don't think they don't really like as if you can't speak their dialect are you going to send out all these surveys or are you send out hand in ya or else how do you or else how you are gonna get those middle age people to answer them ah get it ya i got it i must say whoever is listening to this tape will get this which country did you say what do you mean you're sending this i don't know it's going to be sent abroad ya and i don't really know where my voice is going for that matter not really this one i'm i'm suppose to hand in by today how many you're supposed to do actually i need only i only need two word  then why are you doing two kay poh how expensive the rest got to do it my own lor there's a conspiracy going on which i know about uhm really not going ah no i'm sure to sleep there that's what i'm worried about actually i might as well do something productive that means you want to skip the lecture you also cannot cannot if i skip also then nobody is going to go there you you send one rep aye just like the case of last year that time at first so many then we count so boring the lecture it's not terribly boring i don't think so it's just that the voice or tone he has the the tone of voice he adopts who is the lecturer no no cannot say why should you destroy his reputation he's an internationally known figure okay who who word  and furthermore he's yet to grade me right no lah it's not that he's really marked you know it's just that the tone is too monotonous right after a while you it's just like one of the chinese lecturers really hah you know that what what's his name now there's another conspiracy that i know about i think he's uhm he's he's very nice person when he speaks he's much better in tutorials actually  word they all not impress uhm are are you going probably on our behalf must be lah or else he look around and can't find me and then what borrow your your tutorial to record ya it's a good idea word taping taping no i don't think it works very well and it takes time to to listen you know word  to do the transcript decipher ya but actually nothing to say right especially for econs lecture you just copy everything from transparency the thing is he doesn't have comprehensive transparencies the guy survives on two transparencies per lecture two transparencies if that is a good trans you know how he lecture or not dictation oh take out a book read read read read read full-stop all his sentences is very well phrased word  it's very difficult to to catch econs eh it's not language or others like history or geography no the thing is he he reads like he writes  word don't tell me that he just take out one textbook and read from the textbook it's not a text it's his own no it it it he prepared he prepared the thing you see but he reads the way he writes that means once we get hold of that book it's gone already just knock at his door sir may i have no he'll throw it at you literally throw it at you no it's just that i i think this is not a very suitable topic it's a very interesting topic you have any help this is what grads talk about all day interesting no i've always find him a very nice person you see when you have something he really meant you know so much it's just that he reads you see and that makes us very hard to copy down because by the time he gets to the middle of the sentence i just got to the middle of the sentence you've already lost it he could finish it but we can't and the words are not simple that's why i said he reads as he writes when you're writing use symbols use symbols symbols like for example change you draw a tri one triangle no different no no this kind we are used to he use he use bombastic words ah so how you change it to symbols bomb draw a bomb i think more time to draw a bomb then to write the word actually for example he says something that you are not very sure about the word lah then i don't how to say is you try to form the words lor no actually actually we know the words most of the time we know you see we can't it's just that we send it takes so much to write the word make it short lor the sentence is full of complicated words so you need to write all the words before that sentence can come out you cannot shorten it then it'll lose the meaning then shorthand lor this is the only solution yes serious why don't you just decide word to sneak into his room and sort of pinch the book a e also can't finish can learn shorthand aye do you know that i use shorthand for my chinese lecture do you know that everybody use shorthand no his is professional shorthand no shorthand for chinese i thought it's what we call short forms shorthand not short forms shorthand i don't ben word you prove prove you want to see my chinese lecture notes yes i would like to i think it's missing word  it's in a hurry it's not with me now next time next time don't worry there's always time i use shorthand you own set is it my own set what do you mean my own set that means i i your own shorthand aye aye i've got to go or else or else i won't be able to catch the lecture okay bye bye ya  she got to call up one of her boys uhm laughing  calling her boy her boy which boy tom dick henry it's not tom it's not dick it's not henry it's eng wah laughing  come on

story of her life not the story of my life lah not yet lah that one didn't reach lah ok somehow on monday i was locked out of my room lock out lock out my room my room because my brother locked the door from inside and the key to the door is inside my room three of them three of the keys in one bunch all  all three of the key in one bunch is on my study table so he lock it so when the moment i

taught enough we i have graduated already taught by corrupted people 
Singapore	so what do you think of the a e presentation we had yesterday uhm it was okay we we got to know about their projects uhm the outcome why they choose the projects the type of methodology they use the philosophical underpinnings etcetera so how then how you gonna present yours i haven't actually think about it but from what yesterday the impression is that uh there's not much of questions being posed to the presenters lah and i personally hope that the presenters and the teacher might not take it might not take questions uhm too personally i mean not as an attack uh personal attack or something like that it's just a purely academic enquiry something like that so it will be more interesting in that sense lah because actually there's a lot of uh things that i wanted to ask lah but judging from the face of the presenter i dare not lah because they might think otherwise you see so that is the thing you know and i guess the other problem is that it deals with physical geography and it's not our line so call so we may not be able to to to discuss the issue in greater depth and in detail and also we may not know that issues in you didn't take physical geog i do i do but really another way in in to think it is that uhm i don't want to ask too many questions and because you not not only bad guy not the bad guy but simply you you know they standing down there they'll be very very nervous nervous and i mean and they don't want to be asked yes and not only that you know it no matter you are the first batch or the later batch if you are down there you'll be very nervous and you hope that nobody gonna ask you questions because there's always this fear whereby what happen if i cannot answer oh right so be it i know so be it but you know you'll you'll definitely feel that you failed you know like you are not that good but especially when you you notice that there are people who would are able to do pretty well and you are comparing yourself with him so you word  oh i might have done that bad so i won't get that much good grades you know something sometime their presentation is ya i admit it's just a ya ya part of the grading it's not the whole of the grading you see so you shouldn't be bog down to anxiety or you know being not able to answer the questions but must take it in the positive light lah positive spirit that's the whole thing then there's a lively discussion nah not a very quiet session just a presenter doing his job or something but i guess it i guess the topic dealt with is physical so no people really bother or they don't know they're not in the line to to ask questions so i guess when it comes to the later portion ya maybe the human the human side whereby there'll be more people asking more question because you are more familiar with the issues ya ya definitely so your your topic falls under what okay mine is behavioural meaning that i'm looking at the locational decisions of firms which are found near changi airport so in that sense i'm asking about why they decide to locate at changi has the factors in changi attract them meaning uhm do the airport does the airport uh create a conducive environment for them to to to acquire their products overseas or to sell their products in overseas market uhm at the same time i'm looking at the spatial patterns uhm is there any special areas whereby these firms will locate are they being dictated by their own choices or by government something like that although my main concern is actually on the uhm growth pole i mean the airport has a growth centre in terms of natural forces meaning naturally you will develop because the airport is there and you attract the firms to that location but i know definitely the government will play a very important role so i had to look into the qualitative issue rather than the quantitative issues what do they think which are meaning that i got to conduct surveys interviews with the stat boards and have you done so yes and it's not easy because they're not willing to talk that much is a is a not is a ya and they are not willing to disclose too many informations so that could be another problem which i face is not many of my surveyed form are returned so my sampling size are pretty small actually sampling size interview ya so are you going to do anything about it because normally when you select the sample size right you'll take into account of representativeness whether the size if representative or where the issue that you're dealing with so when you come across this problem of survey forms not returned there will definitely in a one way or another affect the representativeness so what are you gonna to do with it okay i i agree in that area but thank goodness on my case is that the number of replied are quite equal meaning that i have the number of form which i wanted so i'm quite happy with it in that sense but i would prefer more you see usually like for example under one category only have one or two replied form instead of four or five ya so when it's one or two it would represent the whole you see so that is what i'm worried but as long as i'm able to get something is better than nothing if when you do surveys is normally the case lah unless you do informal surveys over the telephone or doing a tape recording like this then you won't have the problem of surveys not coming back nah the only problem is that you must get to allow you tape the voices to allow you for such interview basically a behavioural approach approach uhm mine is essential texture it's a post-modern challenge and geographical approach uh basically i'll be looking at the heminetical aspect that means in terms of uh interpreting language the text here shall refer to the newspapers lah that of my main source of information for it uhm i'll be looking at environmental issues as contain in the newspaper uh time series analysis of four years why environment is is there any other it's geographical in a sense because the approach is looking at text the newspapers as text and it's geographical because we are looking at environment okay ya how how the media especially the the malay newspapers has been instrumental in in so-called instilling a sense of environmental awareness amongst the community lah so that that is so you can call it a hypothesis so so to say uhm in terms of environmental awareness among the malay community why did word the role of media has been positive positive or otherwise so basically that's it lah and the research thing has been going rather slow and it's brilliant it's takes quite a lot of time ya because you're dealing with not one or two newspapers what you're dealing with four years you know four years and that's three hundred and sixty-five times four over such a short period of few months and having a lot of other things to do i wish i could have done more lah in the sense because there are other areas that is worth looking lah in terms of what let's say production of production and consumption of environmental meanings because right now uh what i'm dealing with is under consumption part how the the the readers specially the malay community so called decode uh interpret the what is written in the newspapers lah i'm not dealing much on the con production side ya production is a a more intricate thing you got you got to know who are the writers why they want ah their intent intention all this so edmund is dealing with the production side because he's dealing more towards the the the production of comics uh so but he has a so-called access to the interviews written by others on the with respect to the authors lah the the comic writers lah so maybe he can use that as a as a basis of uhm ya the production side so i don't have access because nobody has interviewed any of the journalists and why don't you try and interview them i mean wouldn't that be easily maybe you can ya i tried i'm i'm going to interview them only after i have establish my okay your record yes my research findings because without the research findings you go there and you tried to interview you don't have that you know yes because if you have the research findings when you go there it's like your have the thing back in your mind and when they say something which is not correct ah contrary to your research findings it's much easier for you to so-called you know highlight the thing but on the other hand ya if you don't have the research findings in place before prior to the interview then it's quite difficult what else interruption  i'm quite interested about the p s c lah especially on the education service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm lately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details has has not been made known to public so maybe i i hope they can ya that's right but i don't think they will tell me everything lah in details but what i suppose is that they will not exactly touch on the starting pay but more on the increment yearly increment nah because the civil service yearly in increment is very little can say is very little well for my case i won't be interested of any of these simply because i'm already bonded so uhm there's no room for me to look other career until or unless somebody can bail me out of this trap ah ha but you have to pay uh ya you got if you want to break the bond you have to pay yes i have to pay the whole lump sum i think it's about thirty to forty thousand or maybe more i don't know ya i can't i i don't bother actually because i thought that uhm since they already i mean since i have this scholarship and they already ensured me a job it's a six year scholarship yes it's a six six years bond well if you were to continue teaching i mean if you intend to teach right so we might in the same line because my scholarship is actually teaching teaching scholarship lah yes do you know the starting starting pay well i'm not very sure i guess it's about two thousand two thousand odd for guys because of the n s thing lah yes but during the the course at n i e will be about one thousand three right and i mean ya one thousand three hundred well about it and i've been looking through the past years in terms of this uh grant you know i mean teaching grant or teaching bursary whatever they call it it has been static static at three one thousand three hundred you know whereas the general degree uh student-teachers their teaching bursary has been raised ya has been raised over the years ya but this uh honours for for the honours student the the the teaching bursary has not been disturbed at all so it has been rather static at one thousand three hundred  so what what do you think this one thousand three hundred do you think it's enough well actually uhm maybe not now maybe later when the time comes i guess the problem will be there i really don't because presently you don't need the money so and you i guess you won't feel the difference but unless during that time when you start to be involved in the whole programme and you need the money then you starts to voice out again so normally you just tackle the problem when the problems come lah do you think uh the education service has done uh done their part in terms of retaining the the talented the best in terms of uh teachers well if you were to look at my case most of my lect tutors in j cs they have left ya in fact they are all quite good simply because other places or rather the private sides are paying them more than what the teaching line are doing so i guess one of the method is the pay another one would definitely be the extra things which you will have to be involve especially e c as uhm maybe setting out some funny programmes uh schemes uhm camp especially camp ya some some are involve in like you know english camps in video camps what have you so to make the career more ex exciting in a sense lah ya but what what do you think of okay so far the the i guess the problem is the burden they have if the principal is able to get uhm some other extra personnels to dealt with to i mean to to to deal with the to to to deal with this administrative nnt only administrative matters but maybe the e c as you know like you know like maybe for instance to talk about n p c c maybe can get some of those people who are more involve in n p c c to to to become guidence or counsellor rather than rather than to get the locals 
Singapore	actually the the only thing that we have uh i mean the don't know lah i mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us why there is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort lah really i mean because we we we won a lot of competitions true ya the fact i mean my my school like swept a lot of prizes you see so uh uh it was like oh well i mean you've won so many why don't you give other schools a chance you know oh hi lyn hi you want to me in this we are still talking if you want to join in and take over from me then i can make my move are you sure that is about another twenty more minutes to go it's just talking to us i mean making conversation okay all right ya so so ya i mean i they they they they thought that that we won a little too many lah so ya but there was well i always thought red cross should stand for uh the first aid sign lah so actually when when i don't know i uhm when when my my school did better in foot drill i i did question the the rationale look you know what i mean this you are you're you're supposed surely ought to be better in first aid what i mean isn't what the red cross is all about ya so i guess the people were not very happy because obviously you know the foot drill was such a big thing in the red cross as well well i think they view in terms of like like all uniform-groups one of the obvious reason or objective is to have discipline that's true so if you don't have discipline then you can't do a lot of things that's true that's true so i that is the reason why i i was actually put in charge of the drills all right discipline is very important right i remember i was in charge of a pla platoon and uh they were all juniors of course i was senior at that time you see and uh they actually uh could not do a drill well you know the timing is important and all that so uh there was one particular drill where actually which the they form and the was not up to par and i i i while i make a big hoo ha out of it and then they cried after that it was quite quite uh uh quite dramatic in a sense but i think i was trying to stress to them the importance of it teamwork very important because we are training for competition formation where you have to be very precise and you have to cooperate with each other so if you don't cooperate then there is not uniformity at all so that that was uh one of things i remember when i was in school that time so i guess you didn't really like much drills and all that no actually uh for foot drill i did quite well ya i think i did quite well at foot drill i enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that lah i mean it was like quite fun lah you know but there is a lot of hard work lah and i think that because of because of so much drill actually uhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms longer not not longer but i think the the leg muscles are a lot better develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles elsewhere on my body you see ya so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a kangaroo ya anyway i i actually join the red cross because uh i i was hoping to to practice uh to go into medical practice oh i see ya so it was like you know look you know there there is some kind of connections so why don't i just use it like a trump card lah so to speak but actually i mean all my involvement with red cross uh wasn't i mean i i i don't think the the universities took it very seriously because you say oh well you know my interest ya i got red-cross to to prove four years but apparently the the university isn't very interested because i got some other friends who did a lot better at their a levels which red cross took book as well and still didn't make it to in medical school so ya i suppose so why did you go into law uhm how did you go into law then uh i thought on the strength of my english language competency lah ya what do you mean by competency no i mean it's like i i think i'm i'm i'm fairly comfortable with the english language so written and oral written and oral written oral so uh well i mean if if if if if i am really lousy at the sciences you know why don't i at least use some asset that i have which is competency in english so you know use it in in in in a field of study which which requires that kind of command uh uh i mean i i won't consider myself proficient lah because there are a lot of words which i still don't use don't know how to use don't know the meaning of so uh ya what's your opinion now of this singlish do you think that we should talk the way the other singaporeans are talking or should we talk the way we have been uh taught and brought up to to to speak like a normal you know rofessional at work well i think it depends on the uh situation in which you use your language uhm let us say now we are talking i mean would would it would be more like uh personal right let us say the situation calls for it then uh we have of course uh some singlish thing you know injected into it the conversation ya it is true i uh i mean obviously if you want to do a professional presentation then you jolly well mind your grammmar that's that is true that is important just like when we are we are delivering a lecture then i think it has to be of course of a certain standard not so much singlish but the singlish is used to illustrate a probably a a some some what you call uh some jokes along the way to make the lecture more interesting and to also the relate to the students who are more more or less uh very localise in the  word in the singaporean uh context ya no but uh you know have you ever considered this this question if supposing now like like for instance right now uh ngee ann poly you know they they have this business chinese business mandarin course right uhm i mean suggesting that actually the the level of lang of of mandarin spoken in singapore is not really quite up to par so that is why you got to use uh uh you you got to teach uhm singaporean chinese the proper chinese words which which is understood in taiwan or or in china i mean isn't if if supposing we all spoke chinese i mean don't you think there is an equivalent in the chinese language of singish yes yes right so you know uh similar a a similar problem as well ya ya but is is the problem that big i thought that is not that critical as far as chinese it is not not as critical as i know well if let's say uh we speak to a taiwanese now in mandarin or to a china chinese in the normal chinese language uh or mandarin for that matter i think they still can understand us but if you talk about say dialects let us say uh in a different provinces uh then i think it may be a bit difficult but by and large chinese i think still i think it is still all right okay well i mean because quite quite definitely like in class where where we meet with the students and you hear them speak in mandarin i mean quite obviously it is not hundred per cent mandarin all the way isn't it true also because they they drop in all kinds of words and and all kind i mean they they twist the expressions the other way you see so that it it it follows uh uh maybe the english pattern of of speaking right they just translate it ya direct translation ya ya that is right so ya but i suppose it also depends on who who is talking who you are talking to well true i mean if we all talk in man if we all use mandarin to teach and i suppose we would all have to speak what up to scratch mandarin but i mean even now when we teach in english we i actually we don't speak up to scratch in english isn't it no not at all i i mean like for me i know i i drop in a lot of localised expressions ya just to you know like i said to the whole loosen up ya developing a rapport but one thing i i feel that it is quite unfortunate is that we have hardly any opportunity to really uhm to use mandarin or speak mandarin like in my previous job i i still do get the opportunity to do so because of the chinese-speaking uh population uh the manufacturers you will deal with them uh i deal with them i have to talk with them in their lingo although it is american multinational uhm but now now that in the teaching profession very difficult unless i am teaching a chinese class but i think that is uh a bit too difficult lah ya correct in terms of our language ability to really teach the subject in mandarin so to speak probably takes a while to really get a hang of it ya i know i got some all the concepts i got some students who who want me to speak in chinese sometimes i mean once in a while i do feel quite tempted but it is like if i did that then it would only encourage them to think chinese and they don't improve in their english but and they are supposed to be writing in their english medium uh in exams or whatever projects and word  you know but in a sense i do sympathise with them because they say look you know what i mean it's it's not that we want to how should i say it's it's to aid them in their understanding of the concept expression of course is another way lah but what is the concept they have this problem you see so i mean ya i i do agree lah that sometimes i wish i could use chinese or you know but a lot of reservations ya in case we say the wrong thing ya i suppose it is like i don't want to be laughed at i mean we want to show the best side of what we are okay it's about three fifty ya all right i think we have to call it at a call it off at this moment we're running out of things to say all right then we certainly hope you find the thing useful and let us know have some feedback at the end of it all that was t g speaking thank you goodbye 
Singapore	okay lah you know mondays what's wrong mondays oh well it's after the weekend and ya and i've there's so much work to do i'm doing some word-processing ah what is is all about oh no i'm just typing some you know some work and things like that and then this morning i saw prof in the corridor and i waved to him and i said good morning prof you know in my usual cheerful fashion and then he looked at me at first he didn't recognise me because i'm wearing shorts and then he saw my shorts and he said his eyes open big and he said shorts not allowed not allowed what did you say aw i said but these are bermudas and it's less than eight inches above your knee no i didn't measure isn't it silly oh then you you owe him an explanation then oh i shall i should when i see him i shall now hide behind pillars and not avoid him i'll avoid him when i'm wearing shorts don't worry he's leaving he's leaving in december oh no november that's early i think so but then i mean it will be a nice break for him he said uh that he would be going to china and the i think britain china and britain two opposite ends six months for each countries isn't that nice ya isn't that wonderful i wish we could go away too and envy him ya ya ya ya well you must have some grey hair before you can go for that oh okay i'll go home and take my dye right then who who who do you think is gonna to take over no i think doctor tan doctor tan it's it's not confirmed yet ya usual last time he was acting head when prof was away ya ya talking about china have you been to china oh i went to china in june this year it was quite a good experience and the you know you could tell that china is still fifty years behind time and they have a lot to learn and to you know develop to make the country really uhm what shall i say modern in that sense and the with better facilities particularly their toilets are they using the bucket system no no no they have toilets which are not uh with good facilities for example they have doors which are too low and some of them are without even doors they're just like stables for horses oh did you feel like a mare after sometime we didn't bother we just did it like everybody else but there's segregated toileting i mean toilet facilities for men and women for male and females so you know we didn't feel anything after that you get used to it i think it's a matter of adaptation so we really it it was really an eye-opener and when we came back to singapore we said wow we really appreciate singapore it's a country i want to live that's right ya i suppose a country's ya when you visit it's a different thing if you were to live in it i think you know there'd be a difference there sort of visiting is different but living there is another thing so which parts of china did you go to oh we went to beijing xian wuxi kweilin guangzhou shanghai guangtong and then back to singapore is a dam gonna be built at you know oh yes i think they have already started and this would take about ten years and the beautiful tree goddess might be a bit spoilt because part of it would be spoilt with the you know the big dam there but they think it's necessary because they need the hydroelectric power there are people for and also against it i think it's a national decision ya that's sad ya it's it's supposed to be very beautiful so why don't you go before they build the dam that's true that's true so which which was the part of china you liked best i love kweilin ha kweilin the remote parts i don't like shanghai and guangzhou because they're too crowded and cramped and the air is polluted and oh it's just like a it's it's another concrete jungle uhm ya i suppose too similar to singapore uh and hong kong now and people are there people there are very materialistic they just make money money money money regardless this it's getting quite bad in shanghai and the there're heads and heads and heads everywhere you go just you see people people people everywhere ya i was in hong kong last year oh you did so uh ya it was very uh interesting i like the street activity i walked a lot you know along the streets and the architecture is quite dynamic went into the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation very exciting space oh how long were you in hong kong oh only a week about a week is that all ya did your family or the family went no no i went on a conference kind of thing oh did you present a paper there no no last year i didn't i just attended a conference i'm sure you enjoyed it oh yes i enjoyed it and then the people i met at the conference were very kind and welcoming and then i met this lady an english woman who lived in macau and when she invited me to stay with her and i did good good good did you speak cantonese while you were there no i didn't i you spoke english i'm afraid lei sek kong kong fu wah ker ma ng sek ker bai yen lau ker lor wor ya i i i used my cantonese and then i tried to direct this driver to this you know this place and uh i mispronounce and then he couldn't understand the hong kong people can be very sharp with their tongues ya i was quite fortunate those people i met i you know i'd you know were quite kind really ya the hong kong people i met were quite kind well you you must have met the the good people yes i didn't go on shopping sprees 'cause shopping isn't my  word so but there was some huge shopping centres you know and i i don't like to go to shopping centres really so macau was very charming i went to the maritime museum spent a lot of hours there you know it was beautiful so beautiful exhibits and lovely location you can see macau you can see china from macau i heard that but did you see no i didn't i heard there's this hill ya that you can see just right into chinese village you know just look across the sea and that's china you have been to macau yes i went sometime ago it was many years ago i still have a auntie there do you know what happen to her she she really ran away from china to macau when it was hard you know in china so it was uh a time when many people were trying to run away and some succeeded and some did not succeed some were killed some died while escaping you know that was very terrible so what's she how old is she now oh she's about sixty plus her children are all grown-up her husband is about seventy plus well he's a painter she married an artist she married in in in in in macau no she met him or she they were married they were in singapore you know in those days they were so they were chi they are chinese-educated and they were so pro china that time so they wanted to get to china so they left singapore to go to china i'm sure they regretted but then what to do they made a decision but it was hard life it was a time when mao tsi-tung just took over can you imagine the time where they took over was harsh and the country was poor and it was just work work work work work and no play so oh she had a hard life but she does come back once in a while to see her sisters and brothers here ya that's pretty unusual ya ya so when i see people doing that you know it makes you think that you're really lucky to be in singapore you have everything you need and it's peaceful here and you have at least we don't have hundred per cent freedom you know but you you still do a lot of things the things that you love to do you can do right ya i think ya basic safety is quite important yes well i suppose you know people the basic right to be able to walk safely on the streets at night yes i met a number of foreigners and they said oh singapore is just beautiful you can you feel so safe on the road even at eleven p m and they say i won't dare to do this in my own country and this is not a normal they say it's not normal to feel so safe in a country singapore is really extraordinary you can go to cairo saudi arabia and any part of europe you know you don't feel so safe especially america and new york even in have you been to new york ya i didn't go to new york but i just went there to catch a plane but i was all the time with friends so i was very sort of looked after but on my own i won't i don't think i would dare to travel you know in of course there're certain alleys and places you should not go to yes you must know where to go so you must know the places that's right nothing like your home home sweet home ah well yes yes so do you think you would be travelling uh this long vacation which is in october ya i hope to take vacation because i got a lot of leave to clear you have forty-two days have you taken any days leave oh i took a little bit last year just a few days but i i have a lot to clear before next year so i should maximise you know the holiday and really take a break i think i need it then you can't accumulate for too long no you can't carry forward for one or two years i think two years maximum i did ask christine and said not two years i think it's fair otherwise if you accumulate you get uh practical eighty-four days what are you gonna do with eighty-four days i don't want to carry oh i would love to go away for eighty-four days eighty-four days but i don't think university can spare well run will be maybe two months three two and a half three months ya i would rather have more frequent breaks and i can relax my mind rather than have a long you know break and you feel sometimes it can feel bored with too long a break don't you i don't know i'm i always find things to do oh because your children are there waiting for mummy to take her leave yes during their vacation time yesterday i went to a wedding dinner at the changi golf club oh beautiful area you know and apparently this restaurant is opened to the public i didn't know that i thought was only was it was it an open air restaurant no no but it had lovely high ceilings and it was facing the sea and the islands and then my my my friend i mean it was his wedding dinner and then he had only two tables of close friends you know and then he said oh look at that island  have you been to this island it's called wuming island island without a name i said no i haven't been wuming oh have you heard of it is it pulau tekong in singapore is it pulau tekong cause i said i i pulau pulau tekong is still pulau tekong ya he said wuming and then i said wuming sounds so chinese ya maybe then i said no i haven't been to that island i didn't know it had that name that means it had no name anyway i i had i tried to excuse myself by saying i had always been bad in geography blame your geography teacher oh yes i have nightmares about my geography test still do you know what happen to me when i was sitting for an o level i never liked history because of the teacher she really killed my interest in history and as a result i had f nine for history but i could afford to fail in that in that subject because i had extra subjects so i concentrated in my other subjects and i just didn't bother about history i just hated it so a teacher is so important in the sense that they can motivate you or really kill your interest that's true that's why i mean we as teachers here too you know it's it's really important how we how we teach the student and you know it's not so much well what we say is important too but really how we transmit that knowledge yes my students my science students are telling me that some of the now i know the teachers that they have are not the excellent teachers you know they they are good in their own field but they they don't know how to to communicate their knowledge to their students and to to be a you know to be a good researcher for example it's quite different from being a good teacher and most of them they say are boring in the sense that they only know how to explain how to get the solution or the answer on the blackboard and nothing else because it they they won't bother to crack a joke with you or say anything more besides how to get the answer or a formula ya and i think and the the technique the pedagogy you know the the teaching technique is quite weak they are they're over using transparencies the overhead projector and they're making love to the transparencies you know they really look you know they don't there's no eye contact with the students no question or answer time and it's you know it's a some of them mumble to themselves and are really bad i know and uh i i think i read somewhere that there are workshops organised for uh lecturers or tutors who have had no teaching skills as such no we have something here in the university the you know we have a pre you know before we start i went did you go for that i attended one on uh tutorial strategies just you know a few weeks ago it was quite good not that one i think all new expatriate staff who come in they are supposed to go for this briefing i mean this uh brief course and how to cope with students you know in the singapore context because in tutorials i think you know our students are very quiet here they they they very shy they feel very inadequate and rather intimidated so they tend not to speak not to ask questions and you know it becomes more like a class session whether they they expect the lecturer to speak and to give them answers to questions i think most of them are very passive even the when our students go abroad you see the the the difference between our asian students compared to those you know caucasians they would talk talk talk but sometime it can be empty talk but they will still talk ya that's what they call hogging air space 
Singapore	i mean knew i would never be able to develop professionally in that place for various reasons you know it may be defamatory to name them so i went and applied and i got a job with david chong and company uh david chong word and partners who were interested in my i p practice and there i continued with whatever i p work i had and uhm i i did uh one or two interesting cases like this copyright infringement case various aspects of which have been reported in the papers and oh by the way i had some of my raids and all that reported in the papers you know i'll show you the newspaper clippings and then and then i so so i got involved in registration copyright you know some documentation and all that and when i applied to this firm i came in hoping to develop my i p practice so basically that was how it went right so uhm you went from this small firm to david chong where you also did i p work and yah yah but now we're here and we both of us have to try and develop the i p practice with our practice head coordinator yes certainly we should try we shall do our best yes and yourself vasantha what would you like to know my years at smith kline ah ya that will be interesting okay aye okay i want to ask you has uh you you did a lot of marketing but has that uhm deaden your sort of diagnostic abilities if you can call it as a pharmacy because you know it's different being practising pharmacy as it is and actually marketing certainly what it is is that initially you get trained for a profession but uhm if you don't work within that profession then you can lose touch you don't lose the training what happens is that you may lose some confidence and you may lose touch with the state of the art of the practice but uh it will not take very much to go back into it i mean you must bear in mind that pharmacy practice is very diverse you got pharmacist who are actually in pharmacy practice in manufacturing in hospitals in retail and uhm within the pharmaceutical industry those within that pharmaceutical industry tend to be far more business oriented and marketing and uh yah business and marketing oriented because they're basically businessmen i suppose it's a more fluid degree to have than something like law it tends to be quite fluid but uh it it yah i would suppose and you can also you've got the scientific training you see so that does i i feel it makes a difference because it it sharpens your mind in analytical skills do you do you think it it it sharpens your skills more than let's say legal training has uh definitely because it's my my scientific training that has helped me to develop my legal skills because i felt that with all due respect to arts graduates i felt that when i was when i was still an arts student uhm are you finding all this very interesting when i was an arts student i dealt with abstracts you know like like when you do a practical criticism of a article and all that and that has helped even now let's say when i view a a a movie you can actually look and see what the nuances are and i enjoyed doing that but you see cecilia the yah yah but le i mean legal training is very different you know and i think my strong arts uhm bent affected my ability to switch you know what i mean because you were in science all along even in school and if there is a marked difference yah uhm although i find that the the legal skills that are required for reasoning and analytical work are very akin to science except that the science is is more precious far more exacting so however analytical you could get with your legal skills and your legal practice you will still never reach the stage that you would truth scientific of truth scientific uhm work yah you see at the end of the day an an chemistry equation is a chemistry equation it's very that's right and it is very exact it is exact down to the last atom for it to be able to function whereas there's always some amount of leeway in in no in in legal practice it can never be exact because you're dealing with changes circumstances and changing times yah yah so i mean no it's not a question of good or bad it's a question of the difference it's a question of the focus yah and it has to be how much more time do we have chris nine minutes hey we didn't do too badly yah so what what else do we need to talk about oh you say you haven't been to sri lanka that would be interesting because i as you know i've married a man who's a singhalese and uhm he is uh i think sec perhaps a third generation singaporean and uhm i i i think that asians nowadays have this dichotomy between them you know about asian identity being which is very tied to their ethnic and racial identity as opposed to national identity and suppose to their influences cultural influences which we have i mean we're a product of uhm colonial times where uhm the language we speak is actually a language foreign to this region don't you think so and i think so the the the the the information that we absorb generally will al always be in the english language okay and that would mean that the source of this information will also be in a way regional from the west and that does that colour our view or does that actually change our perception of who we are i give you an example like the way we dress okay is it considered a western outfit or has it reached the stage where it is international because when in in sri lanka apparently i read that they wanted to establish national identities so they made everybody wear sarongs you know what i mean oh how strange so so what's the link of sarong with sri lanka sarees sarongs you know they wear the how strange but that would be more to establish an identity in malaysia no but i suppose they they have they tie something round their but like like dhotis dhotis perhaps it's called dotees so so do they're saying that wearing pants and wearing skirts and blouses is a western con reinforces the western influence yah yah but does it because if you if you look at it if you look at even england or or europe and all that not everybody dress in jeans and shirts well i think you have a good point there you see the question about all this has got to do with whether which stage the development of the country is at and to what degree the government and the people and the influences of that country choose to view culture and and uhm harmony and identity as a priority i think in this current economic climate uh a lot of governments make the conscious decision that economic factors especially in these times of recession are far more important when there's not enough accordance given to cultural aspects then what tends to happen is that well people muddle along they find their own way and the economic policies override and when the economic policies override your western influences come in because you got your your your your yah your media your investments you got your the countries from which you're gonna be able to uh get the trade and give you know import export so very interestingly now that the western world has opened up so much to the east you'll find that equally be you know they've they've come to the east for economic purposes you look at how england the united states australia everybody is looking at wow the china market the vietnam market the cambodia market you know and the indian market look suddenly singapore who started going off and looking at all these wonderful potential things they could milk from there but singapore is different singapore is still in asia but when it comes to when the other countries start uhm looking towards asia then uhm the economic factors bring in the cultural factors as well and then people start to see do you think it's it's it's so it's could it be economically driven it's not i'm not saying i mean it's seem to be economically driven uh whether the governments give emphasis to cultural things you see once you reached a certain level of of uh affluence affluence then you start to look at things like my identity self-actualization sort of the finer things in life correct whereas because it's gone beyond basic survival yes whereas if you go to places like india okay every once in a while you have this little thing where a cultural thing will arise and people will say and anyway the the cultural influences are still very strong people still have an identity because ninety-five per cent of the population is a certain race you know but the thing is like in india for example where there's been so much western influence and the government had said that there has been but at the same time the government is also so much more interested in the economics of it in developing and you have to because how do you reach a stage where you can say that oh my g d p is this much my per capita income is so much except by improving economically as you know so it's a question of the priority that the country gives to it that that is one way of looking at it but if you look at it from a historical point of view let's say you it it it who in this century all right let's say the last two centuries which are the strong economic powers the westerns you know during the colonial times it was europe it was england you know the great british empire and then in the later part of this century aft especially after world war two it was america yah right so where where where economic strength lies political strength lies with it exert a lot of cultural influence as well you know what i mean like for instance uhm take five hundred years ago they talk about indianisation of this region why because india was so powerful that that there was a lot of trade done in this region through india and india had a way of uh influencing the the religion and the culture so so it is the economic factors which are the driving force if if because comes comes economic power then political power i agree with you i mean i i think essentially that's that's we've agreed on that because it's not that uh the government decides that the cultural if the cultural aspects are going in the opposite direction to the economic aspects i think the economic aspects will overtake yah and then now we have and then and then of course there was china so if you look at let's say a country like thailand and indonesia i mean they're actually quite diverse but at at the same time if you look at the way their script is done the way their dances are and also like their religion and all that it's very much influenced by the philosophies of india then again you to the other extreme well our our pinico is based on the indian pinico  yah but that is i'm talking about over the centuries okay now i think india's influence because right now india is not as influential as when she was lets say two three hundred years ago yes yes before the british came and milked it that's right you know uhm it has its influence is less strong in this region then take china also during china's uh during the times when they were very powerful during the ming dynasty during the the beginning of the ching dynasty the influence they had over japan over korea you know what i mean there's there's there's a general cultural slant that that you know draws its influences from one very strong economic power 
Singapore	oh and then and besides that i plan training courses for the staff as well what sort of training courses do you are you talking about oh things like more of computer related lah things like word perfect uhm lotus you know how i don't think you are that familiar with it you know how to operate word perfect of course i'm very good at it okay it's time for you to learn okay so uh besides this what else do you do well i just started so basically these are my two main portfolios how how do you rate your uh working environment it's very good uhm everybody there is very helpful to one another and we we click along oh and uh where do you usually have lunch is it very crowded uhm we usually buy back and we watch videos yah like the latest one we just finished watching jurassic park on a video on a video yes would wouldn't that take away a lot of the fun but you have seen jurassic park before right no yes i've seen that's why i this is second time round okay yes so what about you what have i been doing yes oh i basically i've been just watching watching movies and going shopping and uh bought a lot of things yah i bought a lot of things  word  so uh i've seen in the line of fire aye tell me what is it this one good you know all this this okay is like you know clint eastwood right so it's about this guy who is a retired no he's not retired he's a he's a very old f b i agent so is he still working now or he's working but the first time uhm he was suppose to protect uh j f k when he was shot you see and somehow when when he heard the shot right he couldn't react in time you see so this time ha there's a there's this uhm this this man who wants to assassinate the president you know and he calls this clint eastwood up you see and carries on this cat and mouse chase chase speak to him over the phone at the time he would leave some clues so it's that he will bring the police quite nearly and at the end he will always keep one step ahead so the whole story is about how uhm i mean yah lah the typical so how he finally he solve the case but the thing thing about the show is there's are a lot of uhm characterisation so like in terms of the characters lah you feel like very real you know it's not like some rambo style or fugitive you have this super super edition man running around and all this getting ahead of their you know so it's like more realistic than yah this is more realistic and the people are more real you see they've more depth to the character and uh yah okay okay the other show i saw was dave okay it's also about about this man who uhm who was to look like the president you see so while he was used as a stand in for the president when the president goes into the public so instead of the president going to public he go into public why because uh just prevent the president from being shot or or okay but what happens is uh in the end the president died you see of a heart attack so he has to continue to put up oh he died of he died of a stroke while having an affair with his secretary okay so what happen is the the the chief-of-staff right keep the impostor in as he would control him you know yes yah yah so the story goes lah both of the both of the films sort of like make it sort of like symbolises the american's disillusionment with the government president because they always portray the government officials as bureacratics or just just for their own gains and for their own selfish uh own but it's quite difficult right actually so and usually portray them as uh you know the president is always portrayed as a useless person you see and the good guys are always the the everyday guy you know the word  yes so so yes okay so now the fun thing is have you bought your telecom shares uh at least oh okay at least the group b i apply for the group b shares but i haven't applied for the a shares but a shares because first of all i didn't apply for the first time so i didn't get the two hundred dollars more the extra two hundred dollars but they can can't you top up have it topped up i was so lazy and then i was i just didn't want to top up there's no queue now you better go thursday is the closing date i think thursday for the topping up c p f i don't know i think but they have to send you send me the blue the blue form and i have to send back did they send you in the first place no i never had because my c p f is not i don't have a c p f account ya how come didn't go and top up is it yes oh must top up meh but i was thinking you put one thousand over dollars into the c p f just to put put it there i think it's quite silly right then you can sell it when the thing is listed lah i feeling i'm being part of the mad rush of the foolish  word  you are so free now you might as well spend sometime queuing up and i wouldn't sound self-righteous especially after today's uh oh when making your money is it tonight you can tell uh you know that uh when you a first few paragraphs right whether it's by who one you know yes whether it's by you too you too you too whether it's by whether it's by pastor david or like which which author whatever danny yah yah true if you if you come across a lot of words uh which you cannot understand one uh that is mostly danny danny right if you come across uh if you come across a a lot of rhyming words you you know then it's daniel then it's daniel the tomb and the womb yes that was that was so funny my goodness okay then if you come across things like uhm no specs some lines in which you know like or things like money does not make us happier it'll only make us more difficult to be happier then you know it's pastor david pastor david okay okay so when are we going to have our dinner oh the sheraton food thing is it yes oh have i told you about the sheraton food no you have not oh what am i talking all the time why don't you tell me something about why you told me about the sheraton food what okay what happen at at this place is we go sheraton and we ordered this uh set dinner you see okay and the set dinner is uh consists of it's a total of thirty-seven dollars plus plus and you can order anything from the main menu right and some of the very very uh expensive things you can order are salmon uh appetisers or uh or oysters and they're very very large fresh oysters large servings large servings okay you can you can also order things like the steak which cost almost thirty-seven dollars a meal for that price yah that means it's this one lah from the menu lah so other things include the very famous ice-cream  word and uh you basically eat a lot you see and the service is very good but of course you must willing to pay almost forty over forty dollars because it's about thirty-seven plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus lah the taxes yah okay so uhm yah do you shop yes i usually shop during weekends and where do you go uhm my favourite place tangs i used to go to studio as well but ever since uhm it was it has been shifted to takashimaya the things there are more marked up-market so i for me i still go there but i don't usually i don't get a lot of things there anymore what is the link you know as a what what link there's this shop called the link part of the link is it part of this a chain of shops or what with takashimaya takashimaya i'm not sure do you know i don't know i also don't know because the other the other day i went with my friends and he was looking for this this shoe called what hah doc marten is it oh i i heard of it you know those shoes that is it's usually black ones yah yah yah then it's very shiny one with very thick rubber soles you know and uh something that everybody else is wearing you know yah but i don't it's not very nice right it looks so it's just it looks in nah but it's very boring you see yah yah right i don't think i'll like that kind of thing so probably i'll yah i've more time of shopping i think nowadays people shouldn't dress like the mainstream people but now they want to be trendy so called is is yah but the the funny thing is the trend is to dress like mainstream people yah that kind no but that's that that is what trend is all the time what but break  what what do you think is a average uh person's idea of what a good life is average person uhm like youself very funny okay good life i think for us it's a bit different lah i think i'll i'll speak of average the average person basically the five cs what are the five cs a car a credit card condominium i can't remember what else cash cash cash and what a career children ah children children yah i don't think it's cash lah credit card included already okay i think uh i think maybe what do you think so maybe they'll work for it so sometimes it's at the expense of their personal life or even their family life because they're so busy building up their career so it's basically credit card car and condominium lah yes and uh club membership yes as well as uh maybe yah cash lah cash and credit card yah i mean because these things are like uhm what people think still happy word  they happy not really because they find that it's an achievement why is it that people wants to uhm buy expensive things or you know lah maybe okay you usually they buy or maybe have you ever felt that that the great sensation when you walked into the shop and you just pick something up without having to make sure you run through the whole town and look for the cheapest deal so far i have i do not have that courage to do yet i see have you you must have yes i have i made a big mistake i went to this shop and then i saw something that i like and i just took it and i paid for it you see really so that normally what what people like us the average jone do is you know you find something you like and then you go and hunt down from one end to the other end of  yes usually that's what i do to look for the cheapest deal 
Singapore	aye so how how did you find the video lecture just now oh that one it's very interesting uh i find that i learn a lot from uh the sharing of the of the teacher and but what what i mean did did your lecturer sort of uh like ask you all what do you think about tape video lecture i mean was it was it like uh you know like our lecturer she told us i mean she asked views from the other pupils and they were saying that oh it was rather boring i mean she wasn't motivating the teachers oh i think he got and motivating the the people who are listening to her and and uhm which is going against what she was preaching because she was actually supposed to motivate instead she ya motivate the students and failed i mean to talk about uhm sinking you see so that's what the comments were lah so what what did your lecturer say in in fact uhm she didn't comment on the video then she went on straight on she went on to our activities just now there was an activity there there there was no no lecture uhm we we have the activity lah yah because we have to so much time anyway only about half an hour you know why because our lecturer was saying that uhm he said most of the time uh the local singaporean uh students they are always uh remember she said in one of her lecture she said they are impress by those those lect those lecturers who uh who can entertain them entertain and over and above you know the the content of his lectures so she says this is this one of the reasons uh why because uh she said you you can rest assured that this is one of the uh this these these are the kind of lectures that you can expect if you go overseas uh lectures and they do not take so much you know not like singapore lecturers they pay more attention to their uh presentation especially with an overhead project uh o h transparencies that's what i mean we you have to listen to the content content to really pick up the interesting thing i mean you can't uh really uhm focus on the visuals to depend on the videos to stimulate you although that that that played a big part in in motivating you to listen but i think for us we have to be trained word  motivated in no matter where how it's presented as long as the content is good yah exactly i i mean there's that's way i i felt that the person who brought this issue out was rather childish i would say to think to i mean to think that we need to be entertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing because i felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm something that you know is she made use of materials that were easily obtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and i don't think you need to really entertain of course that will help but i think what what it boils to is uh yourself lah because we're talking about high-level students here we're not talking about uhm lower level students uh i mean we're suppose to be high-level thinkers yah yah they should think beyond just entertainment value and all that because i thought that that i was actually rather disappointed that they stopped the film halfway because i was just you know she was just getting into the uhm crucial part of it which is uhm you know ideas for activities and i think we need to know about uhm what what what are the different views different ideas they have because i think if we are to just limit ourselves to what we can uh amongst you know the asian context and all that then we are not we're being very closed to new ideas we shouldn't think about it that way so it's rather strange that that person should bring it up and say now and then that it's so boring but i think a lot of the students were not really paying attention to the content uh and how does how did uh agnes chang react to that oh yah that's what that's what she said she said there are sadly to say a lot of the local students think that uhm entertainment comes before content you know uh and unfortunately she says a lot the local lecturers uhm content wise is very strong uh entertaining wise is not as strong so we have to look beyond that especially you know if you see yourself as a high-level students i would think that uh i mean it is so shallow to say that entertainment value comes before content i mean it would be fine i mean it would be a bonus if we get a person who can entertainment as well as to give us solid content because according to to her she says that uh she has once come i mean she she says that the very bright students will straight away know uh whether you are just playing time by your entertaining and withholding all your content or you have no content to provide that's why you are doing all the entertaining all the time uhm and compare this lecturer with another lecturer who's really boring but he's giving you a lot of uh content material in terms of the topic so she word anything so the probably the student is not exercising her critical thinking anymore because if she's looking for that alone and and not on the content what is there to be what is there to develop in terms of the critical thinking part yah because i think perhaps maybe one one one of the thing is the venue in which they have uhm telecast i mean they have uh tape video on because the screen is rather tiny and and and those uh thing projected on the wall o h p on the screen is not well seen cannot be seen i i do not know whether that is whether i mean but i think one thing also they should have probably uhm give us a more focussed directed us to a more focussed what why why they're showing this video to us and at least give us some leeway word  things to look out for yah to look out for exactly because i mean it's this this video screening was like a lecture instead of a lecture with a live person it's lecture over the video but uh here we are in this small screen trying very hard to look at the the notes on the screen uhm so that maybe word  probably they get a bit discouraged from that but i think uh the summary was good the summary she gave yah she gave one of the i mean one of the lecturers giving uh one of the summary at the end i mean at least it helps us yah this is actually what we were we were looking at but uhm it was like a bit too late if you missed it but it's quite but i felt the summary is a bit brief in a sense that i thought she i thought she taught word more than what she has summarised oh of course she did i mean like there was one section on uhm what you call meaning-centred uh motivate meaning-centred programme or approach uhm which she hardly ever touched which she word hardly ever touched on it but i think she guess she treat us uh like what high-level adults and uh probably assumed a lot or she may have thought that what is written on the screen wasn't uhm that important uhm probably more important is the fact that you know we listened to uhm what she has the the person in the video has to share that means that uh she expected us to get more get down more points than what she has summarised ya i think her summary it's just to confirm what we have summarised yes more yes that's right it's used to confirm and like we have listened yah what we have written down i think her summary was written there and then yes i think so like i saw her doing something just now right she was she was scribbling on yah so i don't know but so what what what did your lecturer do after the screening oh we have a very interesting discussion about left-handers and right-hander yah and it sort of confirm that i'm really a left-hander why because because she was uh stressing on the part that uhm that the left-hander they they are more creative although i i don't think i'm that creative but uh some aspect of how i how i exercise my thinking seems to fall in with what she said and what is that like for example i sometimes uh i tend to be more stimulated by visual presentation than verbal one and when come to problem-solving maybe i depend more on images than uh you mean written words okay you mean you mean if you were given a mathematical problem you will actually uh draw the diagrams and then of course because a lot of problems cannot depend on images and pictures to diagrams to to be to solve but i guess that's because of our training in in schools that's why we don't we don't become that sort of problem-solver but i think uh for me i find that diagrams helps helps a lot if if i'm to solve a problem i find that it it really help me to be focussed on a problem we really understand how how to go about solving a problem uh and what's the other interesting point uhm and also when i look at things i think i i adopt i adopt a more a holistic view than you know uh than analytical view on things oh what do you mean you mean you look at whole things rather than in parts things on a whole yah than its part so i guess i'm more i'm better in synthesising things than analysing so when come to analysing problem i'm quite poor i think but when it come to synthesising a lot of things that i've learnt i think i better at it that's why i i really like uhm doctor tan tai wei's because he's very philosophical and people who are philosophical actually look at things on a whole whole yah more holistic yah so did you oh you didn't read an article there there was this uhm actually article that was uh given to us in mathematical mathematical class and uhm based on what you call why are students not using the visual uhm uh using visual uh diagrams to help them in solving in problem-solving and uhm basically uh what they are trying to say is that uh you know because diagrammatically wise it's probably easy you can straight away uhm see the solution rather than working it by you know algorithms you know or or by certain steps which we were taught in school so the question posted was you know why why are teachers not using more visual diagrams to help in problem-solving and then basically they came up with uh several reasons the first one of course being that the teachers themselves were not trained uhm uhm to visually solve the problem and then uh because they actually did an experiment in the american university where uh some very simple actually problems that were given to students and they were expected because they were actually taught uh they were actually the algorithms of uh solving this problems 
Singapore	it was fun right doctor low's i mean uhm miss low's mrs low's class mrs low's class yes yes i i really miss the you know her uhm her style of teaching i really enjoy her tutorials so much you know and together with pee za we had so much fun then uhm and siang ling also we used to be uhm actually i i we knew her style is uhm you know she actually wanted to separate us you see so we tried to stick together oh yah i guess it's more comfortable with people you know but i i like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us to be when actually teaching not like the others because i find some of them do uhm fail to practise what they preach ah well with all due respect to them but somehow i wish those those lecturers in n u s went through this course ah yes because i i think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to know right how to uhm manage the o h t uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics which i thought would be helpful to them because now i'm looking back i felt find a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class and how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university because sometimes i just don't understand a lesson and i find uhm i'm really communicating with the tutor you know he's supposed to make sure i understand my work oh yah so i find uhm n u s tutors senior tutors and lecturers should undergo some form of training to prepare them to impart their knowledge but not just go straight into it after their qualifications or whatever oh yes i think now they might have this course going on because that day i i was in the library n i e library then i saw this publication you know that says uh they have actually trained uh uh trained a batch of n u s lecturers and the poly the poly one polytechnic lecturers to undergo this course and to go back and then and share what they've learnt uh well it's course on uhm teaching them uhm you know teaching techniques or lecturing techniques i see i see oh i'm worried about that yah it's a kind of a small group uh i think probably only those new newer ones will get to try probably the more senior ones maybe they yah it won't be very nice to get them word so i think they're having it currently but you you'd be surprise but i still don't think that's enough i i find everybody has to go through it not just uhm a selected few oh yah i think so too well anyway probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying yah anyhow but i'm enjoying this course so far lah how about yourself yah i'm enjoying myself but then not that not that i'm learning a lot it's like sometimes i i just sit through it for the sake of sitting through it but on ocassionally i think about a quarter out of all times i do find i learn something new yes yes yes a technique that i can uhm you know use share uh something wholesome yes but i actually personally speaking i prefer that uh that small uhm direction from we ourselves rather than direction from lecturers say for instance uhm maybe in fact for myself i'm interested in transactional analysis so i really hope that i mean with the our kind of curriculum we have uh is so heavy i i i just have to devote more time to doing my actual school work rather than reading all this kind of things i mean things that really interest me you see like aspects of psychology in this area transactional analysis that actually and then again if everybody does that there won't be uhm enough time to tell you what you have to know yah but i think actually frankly speaking it's very uhm interesting you know it's really good for teaching i mean besides uh pedagogical wise and learning classroom management everything i mean all all these we're like learning now i think having a really good knowledge uh the psychologically makeup of people is very important that's what i think because i have been reading this book by eric burn you know called games people play i think it's very good you know i do not understand why it's not incorporated of some kind of debonal kind of thing critical thinking it's not only debonal uh critically thinking kind of thing uhm but it's more of uhm analysis into why people engage in their dysfunctional behaviour and this like word  yes uh is it will help in like uh handling uh deviance students or students with problems you know i mean classroom management all the while are you in classroom management course no i didn't pick that because i don't know i i guess i like semi-factual things than rather than uhm actual actually dealing with people because i'm i my own strength is not very much in dealing with people don't ask me why i'm teaching but yah when i took the rizac word test uhm when we're talking about career development i i'm social skill is not of my forte it wasn't wasn't any things that i was good in yah so and when teacher ask us to share you know our our conclusion of of analysis of ourselves i was quite feeling quite sheepish about it because i didn't have you know social that that letter s i had artistic and then the other was uhm investigative and i can't i think enterprising oh oh oh and that was it but it takes all sorts of people to make the world it doesn't mean uh yah right that's why i that how i i saw it yah and sometimes you may not know yourself as well as other people know you like i i keep telling my husband i'm not good with people you're better i'm more task-oriented you're better with people so you go do the talking but he he'll tell me hey no just give it a shot i think your you can put yourself across quite well and you have a listening ear so i i just did it and sometimes i find myself doing quite a good job you know when people have problems and they come to me so many years i think you do have that kind of uhm uhm maybe just that i don't see it myself calm uh very calm cool uh kind of mannerisms and i think it's good in that sense i don't think it being a teacher means uhm you really have to be very social and outgoing yah like say we have a keep a distance also so i i think maybe uh this coldness or what you call it will help me because i i do find some of my friends becoming very close friends with their students and i don't know if that's very healthy yah well i i find myself quite comfortable teaching especially like when i'm interacting with the people i'm giving tuition and so sometimes i i feel like i'm not sharing enough like i'm not uhm communicative enough interacting enough with them to build a good rapport then again when i look back uhm i'm doing my job in helping them improve their language skill so uhm what what more do i want you see and they can relate with relate relate to me very well they feel comfortable with me so i think i mean and that's quite an achievement so you know those yah don't discourage yourself true but but i still think uhm whether one has uhm an s or not in that rizac uh test it's still very important and crucial to a know uhm the psychological makeup each pupil uhm because uhm in fact even i check with my friends of mine doing word problems uh they actually don't do much of uhm really psycho analysising each pupil you see i mean not really analysing a pupil's problems uhm all that things you see or i mean even in p c c g also we don't have ready we don't really have a counselling kind of setup you know but we have already learnt counselling and things like that it's just like we maybe because yah lecturers uh gives information pupil respond teacher gives feedback yah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right were you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse the you know the conversation yah i think it was time constraining yah but i find that maybe they should actually enlarge this area because it's i mean give us a real mock up yes of counselling session or an actual class dealing with pastor pastoral care because otherwise then we'll be just like uh uhm i mean we we are just dealing with symptoms and not the problems you know they they will always these pupils will always come back and the same problems and the same problems again right make them really frustrated you see yah but i think pastoral care is something uhm you can't really learn as much as you can learn uhm classroom management because it has to do a lot with your own values and how you approach problems yourself because it's basically sharing yourself you know being a second parent to a child that was what i told the teacher but i guess she didn't find that uhm fitting comfortably in her lesson plan so she kind of dismissed it but i still after all these weeks i still think it it's basically teaching you how to be second parent yah true it's yah it's really like all inclusive everything you've got you just try your best to help the child to become a better person i i just wish they can incorporate more of this uhm things maybe next year lah probably they will more of you mean to expand more counselling yes the p c c g programme yes more uh hand-on session practical sessions and more of uh like uhm more new theories word  i mean those teacher theories that we learnt you know uh like uhm the ones uhm uhm ericson uhm yah right uhm it's like kind of oldish already i mean it's like all those skinner's behavioural i mean modification it's kind of it's already so back dated that's what i find i mean we should actually read up more or fraud's theory it's very very bad dated i find them too general uhm they may be applicable still today but i find them too general and uh like a lot of academic theories tend to be so you wouldn't find any individual case fitting very nicely into on one model but uhm there are always variations and thing i mean we are man-made anyway some man will continue making some more theories uh yah but so far i can't say i haven't learnt anything but uh it's just at the tip of the iceberg or maybe just the tip of the tip of the iceberg actually i learn i did learn a lot but it's just that uhm i thought it could be better if they could incorporate uhm i mean give us more time to pursue our own interest you know our own interested areas uhm you know but but the curriculum is such that we we don't really have much time for our own interest you see i mean they're nice to give us uhm three-way plan  i think i think it's they're strike a compromise already with half the term half the course devoted to uh common subjects and the other half to specific areas so uhm perhaps what you like would be one-third common subjects and the other two-thirds specialisation 
Singapore	so are you watching on monday the ten commandments is it confirmed i'm not watching you know did you ask joel and the rest of them just now should have asked him te teresa teresa and sue still haven't i'm watching uh gone with the wind on monday do you do you watch it before no i haven't i thought you watched it before that's why and then you want to watch gone with the wind again so why no i don't want to watch ten commandments because i have seen twice and recently i saw it uh about what a month ago i saw it on video  word see how lor no if you are going on monday then we can go together where are you watching i don't know i should should be cathay lido is no more uhm ten commandments no more that's why word if you are probably would be prince yishun ten watching the three-thirty show that show is three hours long right somebody told me very very long somemore there uh intermission it's very funny well last night he's telling me word tell me very long one he was so tired and then when intermission he come on he said ah still intermission oh shucks they just want to get it over with right it's like oh another second half leh again so long but if you're watching are you all watching on monday don't know i i can make it on monday but i don't know about  word and teresa teresa won't have have anything on what because we don't have anymore five o one she takes five o one yah depends jenny right yah jenny chua right yah jenny chua she was my classmate she was my j c she was one year my junior she very seow one because last time j c we were in chinese high school so she was there i mean i i was her senior lah then so that's how i then she took then i disrupted from studies she also took lang so we were in the same year lah oh one year one year difference so she did honours yah she did honours she was my classmate same clique uh so she is very fun to seow one ah yah but i'm trying to teach her swimming now that's why just now i went she can't swim yah just now i went i approached her because we're supposed to have a lesson on friday but she said she feels as though she like you know like i might feel obliged to teach her every friday so yah she doesn't know how to swim last week i taught her how to uh breathe in and out of the water she panic you know you what she uh after kicking and trying some breathing and some kicking and breathing together i i said okay i will hold your hand and then you kick and then breathe ah then she said but you cannot move you know you cannot you must stay there you know she's just afraid of water yah she's terrified so i told her i will not move so the first time wah she gripped so hard you know but i make sure i don't say anything otherwise she'll feel so bad then i didn't move but i told her next lesson i'm going to move must prepare her aye when are you going to income tax tommorrow lor one to two you got five four one word right yah yah i should have told my friend because i told this to a friend my maths c class word  i didn't ask him because tomorrow his free day it's his free day you see maybe normally uh fridays people like sharon sharon and some of the girls but karan and the word lau ah karan also ming chee ming chee yah i know from which class i can't imagine you talking about me uh you are also quite word  yah they they play i don't think they play on fridays i have only seen them once on fridays but sharon in normally there she's there sharon seems like very free always come for word she's very hyper you know word because she bathes very often that time after bathing she word she went swimming yah whatever word  very often she and another girl aik leng do you know aik leng i don't know quite quite big size long hair one right long hair quite pretty i think i saw i think i know who yah the two of them are very close so they always play s p e one right no no she's not s p e no but also as active because the two of them i think they were from the same j c so it's like they know each other before lah very fun tomorrow what time you play  word  who are you going with ah lip i don't know then i just assume they are playing then you just walk down there yah i mean do you i mean uh beginners not beginners you word  most of them are not beginners  word  sharon is quite good karan uh i have not played with karan and ming chee because when they are there they play by themselves how many tables are there there are a lot but some of them are crooked there are only about three or four tables that you can use but it's enough uh because if you play doubles more than enough  word  no need lah they provide the net you just get from s p e but it must be a good net i'll bring own bat yah you can bring your bat i used to play very often in the hall that means you're quite good what pick up in the hall no the like from my lit class there are guys who play and another girl uh margaret quite big sized actually our pastoral care pro class eh there are a lot quite a few lah that can play who are they one one of them is my friend vick lee he stay in uh temasek hall last time play for the hall lor play for the hall ah then ah another girl i i don't know her name long straight hair she play for word definitely she play for my word  that means you're quite good what  word  can lah is this the girl you're talking about yah yah sharon's friend right yah aik leng aik leng ah the other girl also plays uh table-tennis but she's a bit slow not very alert in ball sense aik leng has very good ball sense that day i played tennis with her she knows exactly how far to move back for her to hit experience no but she's not i mean she's not a good player but she she can you know gauge the distance usually this kind people ah is a very good word yah aye but surprisingly ah zul zul cannot play ball games i can't also what for me is like building up okay lor it's finally i mean slowly lah zul maybe because she doesn't expose herself zul is mainly a static word sort of but she is very serious right i mean like i play games my my motive is to enjoy myself her motive is what to but she does enjoy i mean she enjoy pulling weights hah i can't imagine myself enjoy pulling weights  word  maggie is that of like uh systematic building up like uh do my arms do my stomach yah i quite i find it quite boring lor sit down there or stand down there in the room and it's keep repeating you see it's repetitive it's repetitive you see yah so word  then you train for this muscle and then next one yah then must plan one you know yah when i do sports i never plan i think it's good lah to do a word  people like me so skinny no but that doesn't mean you're not healthy what true true okay i think maggie is quite weak maggie is quite quite weak you know when i look at her like a bit fragile uh frail like even she's thin lah maybe that lah like even teresa she i know she jogs she plays tennis but maggie swims what but i heard she said she got dislocated before right doing what doing word i don't know what lah she was just probably that's why she didn't play uh dangerous games lah better not wait come out but not long she told me before she has a screw inside her arm ah you mean it hasn't been removed uh no so when she go and take x-ray then see the screw but normally they remove it after like two years probably once you fix the your own skin word position because word i dislocated my elbow before so uh okay lah i mean once lah to other people hah if you dislocated once then it it'll occur very easily yah prone to it  word it will come out yah you'll be more prone to it so maybe she is this case lor that's why she needs to word  my father had an accident last year a motorbike accident so the leg got hurt had to screw uh the bones i don't know where i mean i think it was ankle he was on clutches and everything cast in a cast bad uh yah it was very bad i tell you uh that time in the hall then this inter-block game or inter-hall game but i can't remember my friend he's in the rugby team he broke his leg you know it really broke you know rush to n u h then that time we went to visit him just one yah then we dare not tell his parents so terrible it's terrible you know word  no my friend uh during the orientation sheares hall you know what they did they they you know they carried her uh hands limbs and yah and swung to throw her you see throw her forward so what happened was she landed on her face you see and she broke her two front teeth but she was so upset you know and and the thing about her is that

Singapore	well maybe you can tell me whether you'll stay in teaching for your whole life i think i will why maybe not for whole life but maybe for the after three five years later then i will go for masters oh you intend to go for masters actually i am saving up more for masters oh that is nice beginning to that's why always half of my bursary all gone to savings masters in education is it yah or master in arts i don't know lah but this is my own plans you see but i don't whether is it god's will for me to do it or not have you been praying about it have been praying lah now and my mum was telling me said if i next three four years anything may happen you see what happen if i meet a man and i get married and this and that then i don't want to study anymore i mean you know tentative plans lah as least word some preparation i don't know yet you me ah if the door is open i will like to go into either youth work or prison ministry in the long-run serious so teaching is something like a stepping stone oh preparation lah in a way because it affords me a lot of opportunities to talk to youngsters see how they behave yah so unless there is a ministry in teaching itself that keeps me there then i will stay yah but i do hope that the lord will call me either prisons or delinquents ministry so actually now i mean uh by attending this course is just like uh i mean you want to get formal training is it you want to get some kind of formal training i guess not really formal training but it's more like on the job training anyway teaching is something that i like and i have lots and lots of opportunities to mix around with young people and in itself it is a ministry you see because you can change lives you can influence the kids yah that is right if the lord calls me somewhere else then this will be a very good preparation i hope to be able to do that yah i think that word sounds interesting but it is very it is not easy it will be very tough it is very tough can be quite tough you know that is why must pray a lot yah i mean spiritually you must build up also you must build up your spiritual life also hopefully my future spouse is someone who has the same vision yah otherwise it can never come true last just last june i attended this my church camp then we had this speaker called uhm this african speaker missionary daniel ungamore or whatever his name is yah then uhm we are attending the camp then he prophesied you see then he called me out you know i was so sacred because he's a very aggressive speaker called me out then he then he said uh what uhm about this mine i'm going to uhm china no he didn't say he prophesied that you are going to china yes he didn't say i'm going to china he just said that uhm you will be going to your grandfather's land and my grandfather happened to come from china yes you see and he said uhm and then you you'd be going to uhm hong kong first from there you will be going to canton or whatever is i can't remember what is it and then uhm and you will minister to the young students there and if you are faithful okay then you will uh minister to the ladies the young ladies oh yah especially my ministry that is very specific prophecy yah very specific then i was i was quite shocked because he he doesn't know me you see and how did he call you out he just points he just point at me and then i just stand up and i i was very nervous then then he said i got a i i i'm big but i got a small heart then got fears word because i never never never consider missionary work before never so it was like a big step for me and then it happens that one of my good friend my very good friend he is now in china doing mission work work work for six months it is like then a lot of my friends said it's like john the baptist you know not exactly but preparing the way for me making contact esta establishing contacts for me but i think work missionary work in china is not easy i know and i am a very fussy person especially the cleanliness i don't know how i'm going to survive well the lord will prepare when he calls that's right actually prison ministry for me won't be easy also because i'm i'm not firm enough you see sometime i get too soft with the people then get pushed around that is not really advisable maybe that is why i have to learn how to teach first you are very acceptive uhm to be teaching but is teaching your first choice actually uh uhm i was considering journalism journal that is nice but what make you change your mind i mean that that was after j c then uhm amazingly lah the lord just showed showed me which direction he wanted me to go yah then i just come into teaching actually i never considered teaching before for my whole all the while was to be a journalist you know or a reporter you know that kind of thing because i like to write you see yah that is interesting then after that yah lor teaching i actually hated teaching you know initially like when my sister went into teaching because my father wanted one of us to be a teacher so when my sister became a teacher i was telling myself whew i don't have to be one yah so i went into law i wanted to do law because it is kind of closely connected to prisons you see but i realise it's not you never really get to establish close contacts with the prisoners it is very much like a client and some stern relationship so later on i went uhm i did a bit of relief teaching then i liked it very much and i realise that my inclination is actually towards youth yah so i started praying about it and miraculously god has been opening doors you see yah like initially i was offered p g d e primary programme and i knew that i didn't want it so i rejected them and i know that if i reject them there will be a kind of record yah so they may not accept me again on the second application so when the second application came out i applied again and then notwithstanding the fact that they told us that those who have been rejected or have been offered a place don't have to apply again they will not consider us you see so i was kind of troubled i prayed about it and i wrote the letter i i wrote the application and i wrote a cover letter for the application and it's really miraculous how i was given this this opportunity to come in here and i was wagged upside down during the interview you know what did they for rejecting them oh you mean they ask you oh they ask me why i rejected them in the first place and what made me so sure that i am good enough to teach in the secondary school and all that and then they slime me saying that i have no teaching subjects whatsoever no english what but i am not uhm technically trained in english yah lah neither am i okay yah but at least you have lang i mean lit lit lit yah i have nothing so in a way it's really a miracle and i am thankful to god lah because i faced a lot of objection from my parents it is like a big switch in my career because you are doing law you know i mean you did law and some professional degree so to them it's a kind of a sacrifice but i'm glad that i'm much happier now and they are accepting the fact i'm a happier person in the teaching profession so thank god for that what was your sister's reaction she was very upset she didn't want me to come into teaching why because in a way she she knows that it's not easy it's tough and for young teachers you may not see all the happenings within the profession it's just it's more than just teaching but then again she respected my views and i think i'll stick to it until i'm called elsewhere what did you do within that year waiting for for the next application i was doing a lot of temp jobs while waiting so in in a way i kind of wasted a year what kind of jobs clerks serious ah yes accounts clerk data entry operator all those clerical jobs ah and i spent half a year in great joy accounting person  word so close to them but it's it's a good training lah at at least i learn how to be humble and appreciate the so-called lower jobs yes that's right because with your degree uh really a lot jobs a lot of places rejected me how come saying that i'm over-qualified remember the passage that you read or not i think i know i know i think because you under applied in a way in a way they dare not employ me because i'm a degree holder you see and i only want jobs like clerical jobs and all that oh they they think i'm strange nut but it's uhm good experience for you it's a lot of it takes a lot of training and faith you know like allowing god to take control of every step of the way because you really do not know what's happening right it's so much uncertainty because i was when i was doing the odd jobs odd jobs i actually didn't know whether i they will take me in and i just went ahead and spent one year waiting and the lord is good very faithful i'm very thankful for it yah i'm quite thankful of god also i don't know and the interview was a breeze oh really because i i'm i was the last person you see then all those before me i knew them all from my lit group then they were they were they went in before me and they came out with very horrid expressions they bombarded them with lots of tough questions yah i heard so when i went in i was very nervous but i and when i'm ner when i'm nervous i tend to smile a lot you see so i went in and then the first thing they asked me was things like uhm do you have any relief teaching experience things like that then i said yes just for a week then they ask me whether uhm no what else did they ask what is my favourite author so i told them jane austin then they said oh is it everyone likes jane austin then i tell tell them then asked me about the course that i i took for lit right in in n u s and the kind of books i like read and things like that very easy it's all due to my own uhm it's like my own asking me about my own hobbies and things like that 
Singapore	"so how is the thing that night uhm uhm well i thought it was his best play can't think of any other can't think of any play that i really like too far away well actually yah actually that's

marginalised what do you think uhm i think it's okay    extract m3-3  recording 3 recording 4 so you had i'm the fourth person all right fourth conversation so people go to what do they say word  no i'm doing it on purpose because i know you expect that don't worry i'm used to this i'm used to this ok go away sign this sign this say that you don't mind signing this thing if you don't want your name come out ok then you don't tick it you know what i think word   laughing  censor no i think he's a great guy seriously seriously i think he's a great guy but his style of leadership is not suitable for the present generation seriously i mean i respect the fellow some more he did repay a lot than the world paid him i see ok ok i'd like to talk about other things ok let's talk about i teaching myself in what relativity and uh quantum mechanics  laughing  why are you laughing you are doing that for fun it's a hobby i teaching myself how can you teach yourself a subject as abstract as that  laughing  i'm a physics hongkey hongkey face don't give answers no i am a physics student i am doing physics can you read up now ok you are majoring in phylo no it's not phylo sorry it's phylan right can you pick up a phylan book of a certain level and be able to understand all these big theos and whatever because i've done that exactly but it's easy if something you studied before so isn't that what university education about training your mind having the ability now to pick up any book that you want to read and teach yourself wah no exactly now physics is possible right i mean can read anything anything new and absorb new ideas right the thing is it might possible and simple not it's not simple it's hard but the thing is it's possible just now when you paged me did you write down your number yourself no i did not it came as 354 0026 so i keep calling this family when this little kid picked up the phone and say mummy and daddy are at work who paged me no i never put down my one i just put the double now it just came out like that that's why i was wondering who was it paged me am i supposed to speakers come out with someone ah agree to the recording was singapore is a project of the word  wah mashiaolah it sounds like that meh yeah word  ah ok say second is my mum told me when i was a kid and it just start off ok and it was good what i'm supposed to take no no no no it's just if you want to be ornamous i don't care i want to be famous  laughing  so you guys know  word what do you research this for anyway and it's to study how like regional speakers or something so like how malay speak english do you have lah loh after all you know yes code-switching do you want me to speak like that now no or speak how are you yeah speak how are you speak normally ok no i've done this several times but not for this specific reason but for other reasons how if i don't get this ayah not that serious come on i mean there are options available i know how to feel but it could be the same way it's like right now i just don't have the energy almost to do anything yeah i'm just waiting for me to work for for for like three months on project basis well i don't want this type of working meh fuck you i don't like this type of working dee dee censor look you told me to speak normally   ok i know  i know i know i'm speaking normally here ha i mean like i mean ok my broo works but he is married i know and he doesn't earn enough to even feed himself and his wife and he just bought a car and all that so my mum is sort of supporting the family why why he why doesn't he change work then no no i mean he has lots of prospects he has good relationship with his immediate superiors he just got a diploma which were good recognised and his good working attitude they like him  so i would give him two three more... the only thing is he only has the confidence no more in singapore we all know your how much your paper qualification counts so if he stays there i would say within the next five years he would five years he will wait you know five years he would go up he would be have quite huge high level i would have to start talk to him about that you know cos he doesn't really know about promotions job prospects and all that increments he's a bit blur lah so i mean that's a good task for me to start working as soon as possible yet at the same time i don't want to work exactly but i have to work no i felt this way twice before after college canada and national service this emptiness spoiled...  word  yeah but... yeah i'm doing the same thing like you i'm helping out the csll word i'm most probably be conducting extra lessons for the kids at amp and all that uh i'm really teaching myself quantum mechanics and relativity and all that yet it doesn't do you feel joy yeah definitely you just feel like... i'm just going into that emotion i'm feeling from day to day waiting for my fucking results to come out and then... when is yours coming out mine is the 4th of june the day before yours on the day on the 4th i'll be coming to check if i get honours or not most probably i will not get it  word  what honours yeah the letter with... they will posted on the notice board this is another thing i don't even know if i can get it even if i get it i don't even know that i'll work at it yeah that's another thing for me also i'm just tired of exams i'm fucking tired the one paper statistics mechanics word  which i can't i couldn't afford to up and it was an easy paper and that made it worse because the module was "" yeah it's ok ah"" so for me i couldn't do it because i just got so tired you know i just... and to make matters worse four days later i was sitting in the physics department area and that same professor came down and saw me he came up saying "" ai come on word i really enjoy your paper"" this is the not an exam research paper we are asked to do "" i really enjoy your paper it's original it's the first paper that i read and..."" she didn't say explicitly but you one was thinking no other paper came close to it in terms of you know originality and thought cos that module was basically just reading from somewhere processing and just reduplicating in their own words word  but i felt so bad we don't have time to talk but only say "" ei i'm sorry i up your exam"" but in fact she is a good teacher i feel let let him down can have dinner lah actually word  yeah that's what i'm thinking but can do you have enough money to pay for me like fifteen dollars ok i can send you both if you have any extra word no i got twelve dollars  word  i got twelve dollars well you can eat something with twelve dollars now i was thinking of some hawker centres word i take bus from here what time bus is st margaret 708 or 703 you wait lah seven fifteen something make sure... there was one word  ok now one more time one more time again god is testing... from that day onwards i learned through my lesson too well word  that's not good you know not at all no sometimes i got so angry with my books or doing something can lah five more minutes five more minutes five more minutes five more minutes it's like one hour word  oh i must secure myself word especially now i think it's the lack yeah do you feel that yeah i feel... because nothing that books could actually fill up yeah i agree it is why ah i so desperately to go

like dining outside but actually it's i mean it's not inside the house yah but it's not really inside but it's covered you see it's like in the garden and yet it's covered it was really nice but can use like uhm it's a the the bar in the middle of the pool so you can swim swim no no no it's not it's not that big a pool actually quite a small pool at the side but it's like but it doesn't matter about the big pool or small pool but but quite vogue right to have a pool no no yah no then the bar is like and then he's got fridge and all that and he's all he's got all sorts of drinks how's well security will be a problem right because he can't close the doors no i mean he no no no no no it's just yah he can't close the doors no the thing is he can close the one going to the main house where the living room the bedrooms all are  that one i mean they have got doors it's this one outdoor but it's just a bar and all that kind of stuff and it's very beautiful it's like typically english it's like sprawling grounds right and it's got lots of uhm plants and all that but it's a prime target for for robbery no but it's the middle of nowhere it's like i mean it's like deep inside it's like in the middle of nowhere it's like you won't believe you're in singapore with that kind of sprawling kind of grounds and then of course he decorated it beautifully it was like oh so how so how what what are you doing about it what what am i doing about it what's there to do about it how's your chendol too rich right what's that red stuff oh jelly it's it's if you have it just uh after a full meal you

it might not it might it might sound very ridiculous why why will it sound ridiculous i mean it might it might read very word  i mean when you speak it it's okay yah when you actually see it in writing it's uh yah when can it be finished one week tomorrow so fast you want to see it is it not not really tomorrow lah i don't really need to see immediately but let's not dis deviate from the conversation but normally it's it's easily it's easily to to i think transcribe one female voice and one male voice rather than two male voices right so not too bad you're not really touching your food not word i have to talk you see so that was what happened yesterday lah quite fun lah tonight we're supposed go for disco hah what disco but i can't go lah so what else is there to tell social life no no love life there's nothing happening in that the department why not why not because i'm not allowing anything to happen why aren't you looking for someone i think it's time to censor the tape switch off let's not uh wrong line of questioning no oh you feel uncomfortable is it let's talk about let's talk about anthony what about anthony what do you want to know have you been in touch with him i saw him on saturday yes we went out and went out for dinner and then well we played tennis in the morning then oh yah i was supposed to join you all right yah and that poor douglas and uhm

anyway uh i asked her so because uhm i got invited to this party one of my australian friends lah threw a house-warming party so i said why don't you come along lah i said it's gonna be boring probably but uh said come along anyway so they were all quite game so they came along so we had dinner at dynasty hotel before we went so we were gossiping as usual gossiping about you tell me tell me do not ask i'm sure you don't want this to be on tape right no it could prove embarassing for you 
Singapore	have have you all watched sleepless in seattle yah i caught it last week i think what do you think of it uhm it is too fairy tale yah it is a bit of realistic too fairy tale you suspend believe for about uh one hour forty-five minutes and then yah and you know at the end of the day meg ryan is gonna be with tom hanks she did ah you haven't watched at all no i haven't because no no no be because the thing is my guy friends went there and then they said i didn't miss a thing yah actually you won't miss a thing lah it was more of a lady's show would you consider that a lady's show it came out in newspaper right that was a woman woman show or uh man show and they talking about difference like men like action and women like romance women like action men like action ah men like action play back this one ah okay did you hear women or men women right women i said men no i said that i heard women men like okay okay we all go back to the beginning and listen to what i say thank god it's taped right written prove thank you no no recorded proof anyway yah i caught it it is nice lah it is ta lah lah you know yah you wait for that magic thing to happen and so was there star dust and all you know then after that that soft focus effect no there was no soft focus but there was star dust but i don't really think it was that romantic it's like they are raving about it being a girl's show i think i prefer things like some kind of wonderful or pretty women the message was better aye no pretty women was quite okay right i like freely willy oh you watched it already don't think of it slowly lah i haven't i haven't watched it either fish word  freely willy listen aye i went to watch uhm i wanted to watch a show yesterday i just wanted to watch oh the trailers ah no i just wanted to watch a show yesterday so i i went down to town and uhm i was going to watch wedding banquet but a friend wanted to watch it with me so i decided okay i'll go and watch free willy instead when i got there at one twenty the tickets were sold out for what time one twen one one fifteen show no no because the the the kids are out just by five minutes off yah but the it is sold out and normally and all the time when i go watch these afternoon shows which i always have a whole theatre to myself and about five other people scattered no because it's holidays now the only people that are missing are the o levels and the a level people why are holidays word  i i like all these one o'clock shows where it is empty that time that time i watched wedding banquet yah so yesterday i went yah you went to watch wedding banquet yesterday no not yesterday oh teacher's day wow so the students no on teacher's day the students can't go in it is r a yah yah so the students were out apparently it wasn't a holiday i didn't know it was r a but but then a lot of people with ties were there quite nice quite nice i went to watch yesterday i missed five minutes of it because i was late it was a one-twenty show wedding banquet wedding banquet first five minutes i know nothing happen i i asked a friend of mine nothing much lah i came in at the point where he was promising i think he's i went in late also i think i went in at the point where was promising simon is it his name uhm simon yah that i will bring you to paris had to make up for it as your birthday present or someone forgot someone's birthday did you watch that show uhm the first five minutes was nothing he was at the gym oh yes yes okay that means i didn't missing anything did you like the show i i thought the concept was good yah one of the few nice concepts but it was the first thing that i i saw men being intimate and they look so natural you should see savage nights then oh okay no i didn't want to see that that one is best it is a french show ah hah men are actually natural kissing no but they the thing is first came across as not usually you would you know you you would cringe and like like yah but this one is like they are meant to be together in fact word  but i didn't see much bonding between the two guys actually because they cut a lot of parts everytime they are about to say something or something they snip they or they do something every time they are like close to hugging on the bed they snip they snip oh that is why i didn't see any relationship between those two you know so i i was wondering how come it was so difficult for that chinese guy what's his name simon ah simon is that no no simon is the ang moh caucasian right yah what's the chinese guy's name wei tung oh yes yah yes so so i didn't see what what he was missing by marrying the girl it's that is why in this kind of show it was the censorship was too heavy actually because you don't see the relationship between the two yah lor then so heartbroken but i think the the simon was very uhm very generous i mean if you're in a relationship and when you get smart and word  sex here i mean gender i mean gender and then uh somebody else comes he was like very generous to okay come join our family lah that kind he has to show oh very and the father oh my goodness he understood the whole thing yap he knew everything but he looked so blur from the start he didn't look as though he knew anything no i felt no as soon as went to the back yard and he saw the two chairs i felt that he was already you know they had a lingering shot shot on the two chairs and the back yard oh didn't notice it oh i didn't see that okay lah no they cut ten minutes of this this scene you see whereby simon and wei tung were on the bed and the father came in he saw it he actually saw them no wonder he knew in action and he closed the door oh in action ah how did you get all this oh because my friend watched the seen uncensored uncensored version where i don't know i don't know they were just telling us actually ah they would they show this somewhere else where not in malaysia not in malaysia not in malaysia i guess states lah in thailand they would yah probably wondering how i know i didn't see word  where was the last time you were at thailand last year i am going again this year you are going again this year yah in december what are your plans for the holidays nothing because at the end of this week i am going for ipoh going for what for a congress congress yah which one and then i'll be back the lasalle congress say louder you know okay then after that i'll i will be back on the twenty-eighth and then after that that music ministry presentation at world trade centre you are not going to be a priest or anything right priest not yet i i don't know i i don't know think but whatever it is i think you make a good father yah a good father what kind of father is that biological or yah or a good priest whichever yah that that is what somebody told me too so because kelly always relate well to students oh really kelly i want to catch the firm tonight maybe which one which firm which one the firm oh the firm i heard the film yes i heard the film too yah the firm the firm aye it's a long show you know really another one of those like uh what john denver end at two quite boring the book is better eleven o'clock show then the next show is at two-thirty oh the next one the next one is oh the next one is at five or six or something okay got to go back and get my friend now but even in the line of fire was quite long right i didn't watch that i didn't feel like the show yah too long it it ended late it ended real late i watched fugitive oh which one fugitive 1 or 2 fugitive 1 lah that is nice harrison ford then then someone someone else in it who is the other guy jamie lee jones oh yah yes he was the best that that cool guy oh oh yah real cool someone i was right it it's it is my job he was really cool he stole the limelight you know even though he's not of of i don't know but quite heartless uh you you could no you could you could hate the guy but you eventually ended up liking him at the end of the show yah ah because he actually basically was just doing his job yah i think he was yah and he was a thinking man too he didn't just take everything he did ask questions like what do you want to be a hero when he was running away you know the hospital yah but after that he just pushed that aside and carry on with his job right suppose to lah yah true but it was just i run away you come after me i run you come so so i i didn't find that show that interesting compared did you watch in in line of fire yah you find that interesting yah i found that oh did you watch that show clint clint eastwood yah nope haven't watched it yet i i i think it will be more interesting than this because usually when we say when we mention crink clint crink clint eastwood you would think of someone who's really tough right actually i just think of someone real old no yah so so so yah so in this show you will see him old and frightened oh i don't want a woman in a man which i i didn't expect him to be able to portray i remember him in the make my day make my day yah yah that that is the image we have right but in this show he he came across as someone who's afraid of death i mean just frighten lah more human my favourite actor is sean connery oh oh is it why sean connery oh who isn't who doesn't like you i didn't like him you know before when he was younger as he got older only then i started to like him now any show he is in in then i will then my mother was like asking me how come you like bearded bald men balding already right isn't he balding but he looks good i think his prime show where he started yah like he started maturing was name of the rose i think that was that was that was when i was converted 
Singapore	so what are you going to do at takashimaya afterwards i don't know actually there's nothing right there's nothing much to do there right i mean yah unless you are buying something buying so expensive well i mean you don't have to work you don't have buy at studio lah i suppose yah yah but anyway i think studio hah they don't open on sunday but today is not sunday what yah lah yah lah i mean they don't open on sundays do they follow the tangs one oh yah ah yah yah yah probably they do lah once they had this interview you know with uh the old c k tang ah not his son or what is it and then they were asking him why why is it their store does not open on sunday you know because they were the reporter was quite curious because sunday is the day where most of the stores make their money you see saturdays and sundays weekdays much less so ah then the man the man just said well after a certain point you just have to say you just have to know when to stop lah you mean stop earning money ah in the sense that not money is not everything you see yah right to him lah and i heard he is a very devout christian and uh he follows the sabbath ya lah ya lah that is why lah because i probably they were thinking like aiyah we have so many millions already you know what is another couple of millions i know they some of the tang clan or what family or what they attend this church at uh queenstown is it yah it is called church of our saviour and i know that one of the weekly bible studies right it is held in the tang's boardroom it is held at tang boardroom tang boardroom really ah yah i told you right yah lor yah lor anyway are they a big family they control the whole empire they own tangs studio and i think i am not sure lah this one i think dynasty hotel no i mean the management is it like no the own it yah but that means the top-level management yah lah yah lah yah lah is occupied by the their own relatives or what yah lah the son lah i suppose the old sons of c k tang they used to have small neighbourhood shops down at macpherson ah hah uhm one at i think at katong and uh yah one at macpherson and one at katong ah hah because uh my grandpa used to like buy liquor from them they sell liquor you know one of the one of the accountant word yah the old whisky type and then they sell the very old type the the one with the old chinese uhm god you know that guy with the bald head you know but anyway anyway i think of all the local stores ah i mean the department stores they are one of the ones who are doing better lah like you see metro keeps closing you know right they they i think they stocked quite intelligently because they does they they don't just like anyway anyway all shopping centres look alike yah lah but they all there are very strange and interesting items you see like like studio tangs lah yah yah this niche marketing lah yah for the young one yah like the tangs is reserved for quite high class one and more general audience yah aye even tangs is quite high class one you know yah lah yah lah all those stuff not cheap at all but then i think it would be hard work man yah but then but then if you notice most of the department stores in singapore are japanese you know it is their fad correct you see yaohan one isetan two tokyu three daimaru four takashimaya five sogo six it is their third retail  word  ah it is practically new form of japanese imperialism the only the only non-japanese ones are galeries tangs that is all what galeries tangs robinsons ah robinsons metro metro john littles yah that is all mostly japanese more than half uh some more japanese are more aggressive they upgrade very fast like you know uhm keep upgrading you know why because they have so many in japan right that that one here uh that one here right can draw from the japanese resources you see while tangs only has one shop here yah lah yah lah you know what i mean yah there is a difference uh wah here damn sleepy man yah all the food uh yah i need to walk it off uh actually i am supposed to go swimming today today ah yah actually i thought of after the food uh maybe lah anyway i like to go swimming around this time not too hot you see and the pool is emptier i went yesterday ah hah there is only three person in the pool is it yah toa payoh pool and they have new tiling everything because of the sea games yah and the shower is very good it is not like those too powerful or too weak but too powerful never mind it is too weak it is the problem you know the one in uh s r c it can blast your skin off you know really ah serious nobody that time me and alvin we went right so we stood under the shower wah he got hit first you know then he jumped out you know and then we started like flexing ah waiting for the water pressure to go off uh then we go inside and bathe it is like are you sure it is that bad aye it is really strong really it is very strong it hurts you know hurts your skin because the shower head the the hole uh damn big uh i don't think i have ever swum there you know no i never oh there is one lecturer who always swims there uhm i think it is p s p s uhm p s p s what what what's what is his i mean is he chinese indian or what caucasians there are a lot of them right caucasians yah yah yah p s my friend told me it is p s because uh fat skinny tall short what muscular quite hunky guy muscular p s lecturer ah caucasian p s lecturer got meh maybe it was first year lah it was during first year i saw him maybe he is not around anymore young or old uh but then they wouldn't be young right about middle-age lah but he really good swimmer you know i was there for one hour he was non stop up and down the length you know is it is he balding no no he has plenty of hair and he uses the the board you know attached to the hands and i felt so inferior so good you know i can't i seriously can't think of any really really ah well-built p s first year first year even in first year really ah is that is that department very big it is lah it is just that i have seen all or most of them you see i mean even if i have not been tutored by them right the only person who is not like really in bad shape maybe is doctor david brown you know but he is kind of balding you see oh and i know he runs but i don't know whether he swims no it is not that guy that guy with a a bit of moustache he wears shorts all the time are you talking about david brown or what there is one guy who always wear shorts ah hah it is not him no he doesn't wear shorts he's got a david brown doesn't wear shorts oh maybe it is history the guy who wears shorts uh he is from history department he wears short all the time you know so whenever he wants to go library he has this runner you know my friends called jude uh his runner you know every time he wants to borrow something he will tell jude you know here is my matric card go and take it for me p s ah caucasian guy maybe you know maybe he's been there for a short while maybe you can't remember i can't remember the only the only i have ever seen regularly at uh s r c is max le blond yah but he plays squash right yah he plays squash he used to play with joselyn yah he is the only one you know did you read the papers john kwan terry uh death was reported it is one of those uh columns small columns is it yah today's ah today's today's i haven't read today's today i woke up iron my clothes went out to school apparently ah he was quite healthy uh i mean did they say did they say no because the picture shows him conducting a kind of forum uh and uh it was just thursday oh last thursday they didn't why what he died of ah well uh he is supposedly the dean of arts there and uh responsible for spearheading the arts department yah yah yah i didn't know n t u had a arts department i think he moved to n t u you see right yah it is conjoined n i e lah he used to be here lah then i think he left uh then after that a few of them left with him kirpal singh not left with him lah i mean followed him lah i think max le blond is no longer here right uh kirpal singh still got who uh i think it is more challenging opening up a new department than simply staying around oh yah lah but i suppose if you are too comfortable here ah you may not want to bother lah yah correct besides i mean it's they can't doing all that much different stuff and right yah but i suppose they have the freedom to do a lot more things lah because true lah down here some more they control quite tightly yah lah yah lah yah lah yah yah that is true and then maybe less hierarchy lah in term of rank easier yah aye how uh alfee's that one how no news ah no ah i saw his m a proposal in uh jeanie's computer that day i was using jeanie's computer ah hah yah his m a computer he is doing something on the language poet you know those uhm late eighties early eighty poet ah hah ah hah yah uhm well it is kind of in un incomplete lah like four pages the proposal i don't know whether that is the tentative one which poet he didn't say he quoted a list of uh poets possible ones oh oh uhm none that i actually heard of like contemporary stuff lah post modern lah eighties lah what you expect yah lah true should be quite interesting i was thinking of crime fiction crime fiction yah you i have been reading a lot of crime fiction lately what does this have to do with it no lah no lah i mean if i have the chance to do an a e lah preferably from the one i have already done i wouldn't i get so bored with my own topic uh but you will if you start with this topic uh you get bored with this one also you know yah i was quite excited with my william gibson then halfway through ah i just got so sick of it 
Singapore	chinglish singlish chinglish don't know what but actually it's very interesting uh if you were to compile some kind of a of this article a list a list uh of all these terms that are used because sometimes we use it but we don't know the origins or why and uh and the younger ones ah the younger ones uh the dialect-speaking people ah nowadays they they don't know all all these uh sayings you know yes these are idioms eh idioms oh yes idioms you mean actually they don't speak dialect nowadays now they are very they speak mandarin even mandarin is also not standard english aye can't i make you all a drink no don't bother no lah i i i i just had a big cup of tea can you remember this this hokkien saying qi mi kuei teo diao tang when when i told siew lin the first time okay first time what do you call that uh say you are very lucky lah you know you are lucky qi mi kuei teo diao tang it is a common saying proverb it is not proverb it is not really proverb it's it is common expression what is that classic one 'qi mi kuei teo diao tang'  word is so blind so blind even even get so lucky you know to go and tok teo yee eir tang qi mi kuei teo diao tang yah that is it actually a lot of such sayings are beliefs you know yah really lah joke you know it really expresses it you know the luck involved oh boy siew lin i remember she really first time luck  word  qi mi kuei teo diao tang so lucky especially when the situation is so apt you know ah then you say that wow yah that is it gong gong and then gong gong and then gong hock that kind of thing gong lang gong hock god is waiting and suddenly you get it you know who who said it you know ah phua bah lee you know you know phua bah lee phua bah lee phua bah lee was in the the the former former m p former m p is he still m p uh no no more already he retired long ago now he is working for i think uh hong leong i think he is getting better pay than before ah hah he was senior par perm sect you know i went to see him to get something from him lah walkover in his constituency no contest there was one year i think nineteen eighty so went to get some pamphlets and so on so i say mister phua you are so good people are afraid of you lah opposition dare not come to your constituency lah boh lah wa gong lang gong hock gong lang gong hock gong lang gong hock lah you are sa sa gong lang gong hock because you are you are not not really hock hock is what hock hock is luck but it is not an equivalent to qi mi kuei teo diao tang it is not really not the same not the same but people say you are not very good but you have but somehow god favours those who are not very smart or something like that lah wah gong lang lah wah boey heow siew lah gong lang gong hock gong hock lah gor hu hock it is something like a simpleton you know yes it is simpleton but he is actually like they say like he is who who doesn't plan but anyway you know somehow or other uh luck favours him can be fated or not easier simpleton can do around without any uh scheming or any of that i suppose given that word  very good i think ignorance is bliss being simple simpleminded these are people who are very hey are those your fewer fewer uhm worries white hair your cats fewer white hair yes this is from s p c a s p c a oh from s p c a you got them from s p even this one even this doggie the dog no that one dog was given by somebody only two cats given by somebody lah that that that is the no she was telling us that uhm her dog is afraid of her cat oh when the dog sees the cat at the door the dog the dog you know he gives way to the cat when i feed them eh i will feed the cat first after that i will bring a bowl for him for him to word  and then and then because i put in fish also in his bowl the cat also goes to his bowl you see and he will walk you know he will give way to the move back move aside for the cat to go and eat the fish take her pleasure you know and then he will stand there you know and sometimes when the cat is standing at the doorway he dare he dares not uh you know pass you know pass him oh really because the cat uh does that to him uh like that so mild catie uh slime  word with her with her nail there is something about something about even cats are very fierce something about the something about cats but but they are actually very gentle it is just that they bully him you see bully him yes a dog is very gentle but not the cat no the cats are also very gentle really it is just that they tend to bully him he gives way to them so much that they actually bully him take advantage you you you know that again talking about that the hokkien saying e si bei ngeow why why very 'ngeow' you know ngeow is ngeow lah ticklish no no no no no no le si bei ngeow this is neow you know neow neow is not ngeow no it's different hokkien zia muai zia png ngeow ngeow are you sure sure neow means catie i thought word  le si bei neow le si bei that's why ngeow ngeow wa zin ngeow ngeow means like no no no then how can the neow how can the neow has anything to do with fish le si bei neow ah le boh hie si bei neow i thought si bei neow means it's fussy you know no no no fussy and isn't it like the name of meow yes so why does it means so why but why do we use the cat it is definitely not this meaning word  are you sure i always thought that it was that neow you know neow neow neow you see it's neow mai ga wah neow no mai ga wah neow lah le si meh neow bo he tang jia si boh now how can this neow is that so that's how the hokkien speak you mean they after that there is this word  about the maybe you know it is the uh cat's meowing it is very consistent it keeps on uh word  what is the origin you see maybe it could be so you are very fussy you are very demanding but definitely the cat see to it that you see your objective is achieved so you keep on meowing meowing meow i don't know meow into neow could be lah you know because they they how can they this uh what you call it ticklish when they associate with with fish and you are saying neow ngeow ah because they are so many types of hokkien they pronounce words differently meow and ngeow you know kan ko gan ko in my in my hokkien ngeow means ticklish ticklish same sound lah in fact in chinese there are so many words with the same sound same sound different meanings same sound different meanings le si bei ngeow do you speak hokkien to your son he is so tall little bit lah little bit not very much though you know we always go for the fastest uh way of communicating so but he he can understand some sort of simple your husband is your husband is hokkien simple hokkien he can understand simple hokkien and he can communicate with my mom in hokkien he can only speak well actually speak hokkien although

seats then i receive from here not here usually go the other in front of the building we are supposed to supposed to what never mind you speak louder ah  laughs  why you so when you getting your license ah so when are you getting your license driving license my dad says i should get my f t t first yeah so i you know my f t t is on the 15th of july so after that maybe ah but i still can't decide whether i should do it private or uh school you know at the first place why you think that no why you that you you shouldn't have a driving license since i got driving license ok lah it's not easy getting a license ok first and foremost i am so unfamiliar with the roads ok that is first secondly i am quite scared actually to the way you described to me how to start a car you know it makes me nervous even an old granny can drive who even an old granny can drive yeah but then again back to the whether i should take private or school not very sure lah then take private lah how much you used to pay eight hundred something right eight hundred twenty-five that is almost half you know of what you need to pay but private you private you get good instructor ah but before you take school school for women will be better but it costs a bomb where might i get the money you start working yeah maybe because i don't know through my experience private ah you must have knowledge first then then you can engage the private because they won't they wont' start from scratch right no that is the problem they start from scratch but they don't have some sort of like a book the first day ah lesson one check safety how to check uh your tyre how to sit properly i don't need that that very important that one is not written in the test that is tested everything during the exam ah because practical because you are driving wah you must know the proper way or where is the okay your mirror you mean the private won't teach you that maybe just sit down ok ok i teach you ah first gear ah just like that lah oh if bbdc ah you sit down ah don't go inside the car you walk around the car then he will tell you ok that's what i heard lah to check whether your tyre has punctured or not your sister is in the school ah ok you sit down your mirror you adjust to what you adjust to where where you can see so you adjust first until your view lah ah then he check for you everything is okay to drive off first gear then slowly they teach you about metre also like that like that you have private private teach you all that i really need i really need them to start from scratch yeah lah of course they will bring you to roads empty roads ah empty roads and all that so where do you think i should take a bbdc or comfort bbdc take bbdc bbdc better easy to pass right easy to pass safer ubi dangerous paya lebar all heavy roads ah then they teach you all the technique lah but you have to go for the class you know if you go to bbdc you take your basic area to pass out yeah i also finally you successfully pass if you good lah better after you pass you go to bbdc ah go to bbdc ah you have to take steady class still have to take steady class ah these steady class these steady class usually forthose people who haven't take bbdc ever basic and so i no need lah so you no need to take the basic class just attend the class so you just listen ah i don't want to attend any class you have to listen you have to attend the book ah you have to chop so every time you just chop chop ah oh so you just it's ah it's very i've been to all the class before last time bbdc wah then i thought that's why good wah they'll teach you all the uh the thing accident pro ah they say ok the correct way the thing very good they try show you tape ok you see the newspaper the accident then why it happen because it really yeah lah they teach you very good then you no need pressure you know then if they ask ok those so the lesson you can take while you're driving ok they give you one month all the schedule you can come to these days these days ok lesson one what day what day oh ah you can ok how much you pay ah you don't have to pay one lump sum right you can pay bit by bit right instalment no no instalment two times wah you can pay two times or three times ok twenty-five twenty-five lessons right you don't book two lessons at a time two lessons at a time at least you book ten lessons at a time ok so you have twenty-five lessons right so the first time you book ten so the second time you book another ten the third time you book five uh you book three times lah but if you are very confident ok the whole month you book everyday lah that's why people can get license by one month you book twenty-five days lah ah that's why i start working i start working i don't mind ok that's why i say you start working then you go and go for bbdc you put one lump sum ok let's say got first pay ah ok it's fifty-six you know fifty-six times ten is five sixty ok five hundred sixty ah you book ten lessons first five hundred sixty then you relax first then half after you learn three lessons or four lessons you book another ten don't wait until the ten finish you book again you a very long time to wait ok ah then you book another ten but i think i can afford to do it in one month what do you think one month straight everyday everyday but you need to have the cash lah my parents ah a thousand over ah my parents ah you think you have to count lah but i think i can make if i you target yourself about three you target yourself half a year lah i took one year no good target yourself half a year you don't spend a lot ah half a year but i need to drive everyday lah at least one one time ah is hundred minutes you know not one hour like me ah which is one hour forty minutes oh oh ah that's the difference longer ah ah longer so everyday you target hundred minutes hundred minutes so like one hour can ah one one week two times ok wah it's very scary i'm so scared when you drive

must open huh without fail until five o'clock like that you know you mean one day also cannot close at all   they cannot close  ah ah but then again they make a lot of money uhm so it is okay you seem to be enjoying your beef kway teow so much shiok what why the beef is damn nice uhm her beef is damn nice you just buy beef and eat one day yucks yucks your backside uh  giggle yucks  slurp damn nice want some don't want eee i don't take beef why i don't take beef means i don't take beef religious reasons uhm but that doesn't make sense hinduism never stipulated that you cannot eat beef  shut up word  hinduism never stipulated that you cannot eat beef it did where i don't know lah just shut up lah you see it's a cultural concept wait it's not fair you see ah beef was probably not to be eaten in the indian culture because cow gives milk and milk is also given by the mother and therefore cows were compared as sacred to mothers and that's why they say you shouldn't eat cows it's got no religious connotations yah it is associated with siva what no siva himself is just a construct because humans were not able to focus on a particular point uh uhm they cannot pray to the formless so humans created for themselves forms alright therefore just siva is just a fictitious thing from the mind oh i see and there is only one god ain't that right' yah yah and so there is no shiva so you should be able to eat beef well i've been brought up that way no but since it defies logic so you should start eating beef now   uh no i don't want  don't like because you don't like now that's a different reason altogether  no no no  i've been brought up that way yah so now you're not eating beef because you don't  like it   maybe  maybe maybe yah so it is not a religious reason anymore   maybe it is still  why it is lah why where is the logic no there is a logic are you saying hinduism is not logical   word  no it is  word it is it is i'll think of an answer and tell it to you by tonight i just cannot get my words straight   you are vegetarian on thursdays right you are vegetarian on thursdays right yah word  why uh mm because i'm training myself to become a full vegetarian why full vegetarian because i don't like killing animals lah what's the difference between an animal and a vegetarian and a vegetable what do you mean when you uproot a carrot it's actually being killed as well  word actually i don't like eating flesh word  so it's due to a lack of liking that you don't eat flesh uh what lack of liking yah yah then why aren't you a full-fledged vegetarian then aah yah soon soon so why are you eating meat now uh because i've always been eating meat so i can't like  so you like it of course i like it just now you said that you don't eat meat because you don't like it because i don't like it because i don't like the idea of killing an animal animal and and i asked you no more eating flesh because there's a lot of problem that - you didn't say earlier but let's get back to it anyway  word  you said you don't eat meat because you like vegetables and that was your reason now you're saying earlier you said you don't wanna kill animals because you don't wanna kill animals right uh huh yah and i said when you uproot a carrot the carrot dies also and then you state you said that you don't like the taste of meat mm but you're eating meat now and you say you've been brought up that way i'm sorry i'm lost ok let's get start again why are you vegetarian  no need no need no i'm not gonna give up no need x4) no you see you must do things with logic yah ok and hinduism is perfectly a logical religion yah it is you're going to i never denied that fact yah so why you're not eating beef what beef i don't like to eat beef ok ok lah ok lah you don't like yah but there is no religious connotations to not eating beef right there is so if i eat beef i'm not a good hindu is it i never said that what but you're saying hinduism says that you should not eat beef

Singapore	so the first part will be a brief lit review what should come first the bit about singapore or the bit about this uhm the lit review or should we then use this we start with here skip that we start with here since this part has been thrown out anyway okay uhm so it's not so much of lit review but a review on singapore as a society in composition and and then a brief mention of the different strategies available in developing and developed ya a brief a brief a very brief mention then so the next bit we state in state impacts right on uh state policies and impacts on household structure first state impact oh we forgot the bit about women that's here is it ya reviewing sing singapore women rather this one will include change in religious word  women's women's structures or something uh women's priority ah and change in household structure that impact is on this point so in this case just to review two strengths and policy uh state policies and the impacts on household structure and state policies on child care and some here somewhere here we mention that or here that they are uhm logical uh they've no ethnic bias make it more implicit that they they they don't regard one group above another of this special persons you see the multi-racial identity multi-racial and then we talk about the h d b and other housing policy and down here m c b here put all the m c b stuff here then more explicit exactly what they do right so what we're saying is that uhm because singapore is changing uhm traditional forms of child care are now disappearing right and uh new ones are emerging the the state uh is trying to do a couple things one is to try to provide alternate means of childcare in terms of the childcare centres and secondly to try to encourage in some form of that traditional support structure so it'll carry on that's about all uhm okay ya what what i do fairly nicely right word to  word on okay first of all we could have all all this stuff about how uhm childcare centres are very popular so that's part one right with with women in singapore so this will have partial word  i think we can use like uhm some of the board general idea ya so there will be specific data that which i know data that across all household types and in in fact across all ethnic groups except or perhaps the malays uhm has been a very acceptable form of child care childcare centres word after all household structures then word  except uh perhaps the malays malay okay and then uhm secondly uhm so that's the response  word then response to housing to energy word arrangement and  word and word  so are we saying that the women like responding fairly well to this as well to this this strategy this state policy perhaps you may not say that the women are responding well but that uhm this kind of strategy is correct and if the women are shown that with more than just state rhetoric you know they okay this is working use it this is in fact the case that these women are finding it less of a problem because they have really readily available help at home okay so it is useful uhm but uh i think we could then end by saying that uhm that uhm these have not proven entirely sufficient because women are still finding or some women are finding it a need to turn to foreign maids uhm what's the other one which is up here foreign maids right and that uh even with all these options there are still gaps which is which will be the gaps will be all those who quit right and a few household housewives  word as far as word  no it's that it's i think it is gelling on all the ideas that we have been working with and not the next stage will be the uh economic restructuring phase uh women quitting and also the cultural constraints word  i think that's enough nah ya and i don't know right i mean if the introduction takes up if you're talking about like six pages the rest will take up about this will take up say three quarters of the page one or two pages of the page aye i think it's more than one ya because it has all the data ya one and a half maybe this one will be about two and a half two and a half no i can't allow that then we have no more space if this is one this is two then this is to be this is about two and a half two pages should be okay right if this is one and a half then two three four five and six okay should be i mean this is this is the maximum if you know it's going it's five hundred pages five hundred words per page right if it's single interruption  uhm lily wants to know whether you're okay next tuesday 2:30 pm for i t h g okay i've asked her to give it okay so when am i going to get around here so should i tell her that you might do when you're slightly no i don't think you need to tell her that she doesn't word  so sorry well i'll just say that uhm that we left lah should i tell her that we are currently revising that's not necessary is that right uhm i mean because it does it doesn't concern how she's already said here that uh she doesn't want her word  paper give given the the larger papers went in right ya and anyway if this comes out word we could always refrain ya and this this will be different it's not it's not it's not about what the household to feed the household and childcare these these actually very huge terms you know so how the same in childcare and things like that that's too bad well leave that as a working title first and when we get round to it's basically a policy evaluation type paper right ya from what what she feel i think it'd be much better to go along with my if you want to you could but i don't think necessary but if you want to you can say that uh you're revising the paper to send it off elsewhere but uhm you're happy to to summarise the main ideas uh to give emphasis to state poli policies in singapore mention the what's this for asian cities word  you seem to be getting a bit more mileage out of that conference that caused you so much agony agony i think i'm sick because of it must have settle with my bone last night i could not even swallow it was so painful because after a talk to marietha for two hours i went home i discovered my voice had totally disappeared and my my throat  word was very very swollen every time i swallowed it was like pain word  you know when we have a fish bone stuck in your throat i felt so bad and word oh my goodness when i left my medicine at work because i was so late i just grabbed everything and i went and then i convey to my husband i said this new antibotics you've given me is not working and this the worse way word acting on because you can't take all the others but luckily by around six o'clock next morning word  when i take look at and then i took another one so so what did your husband say it is it's a throat infection throat infection okay so uhm their their deadline is end of january right i know if i don't get it done we've i think we'll try to do it by december then you which one is given by word or the other this one is easier lah ah sure but they want don't want already so that's more or less there it will be centre this one you know that uhm i think it's safer to do the other one first because then at least i know what's ready word  that's right i think we give priority to that one i'll that day you know you're trying to tell me to do both by december i mean i know it's necessary but it's well i have to get round to doing the women's studies one too and that's like one out of word twenty still haven't revise my word  oh that should be quite fast what why don't you do when fauziah's around she was she i i gave it to her and word  it's basically that one section that has been rewritten right i don't remember she she just looked at it and wrote some stuff on the piece of paper we talked about it and i was like okay okay never mind we could say something bad about sharmala that is true and karmalini ai aiyah what i always say to karmalini i always hear them before i see them the three studious three oh ya uh what's the other girl's name you know the one who's walked in suzanna let's say it loud stop this right no she wants us to continue talking for a while more oh or you want it back or you want to continue talking for a while more uh maybe another what do you need it if you don't need it it's five minutes okay fine you just stay outside five minutes ya okay okay so and then uh this so this thing would be about how multi-generational households different members use how they use space in different types of flats right and uh some themes would be like the how they negotiate public and private space and uh how uhm how they were maximised what what's the term i want where you use the space for multiple purposes like something could be used as as a sleeping quarters at one point of time and then change no because all like for example smaller flats a bit of constraints so uh negotiating constraints of space okay like uh multiple functions that kind of thing right or where you have to have two dinner times or that kind of thing right ya i think we just talk about it as temporal staggering of like bathing ya i think it's one f brenda sorry staggering off shoo don't bathe today don't eat today and we could think of other things ya and perhaps also like uhm if we do manage to find part of it in the case study ask them what they would like you know and whether they could word extensions extra balcony space and all that so this creeps in to the upgrading we will step on certain people's toes sometimes what what physical aspects they will like changed what their okay this will particularly be pertinent in the m g flat which is specially designed and then for those for the other two types we could talk about for the last type the three room we could talk about upgrading upgrading and what they would like to see the extra balcony and all that because uhm ya word time it's it is not mine neighbour but it will be coming soon so uhm you know we might be able to it'd be nice to have on the word have already had it but the upgrading process hasn't proceeded far enough ya because the one in-charge of jalan nela was only a few and we could go and ask we could get louviana to give us the contact she did  how how is she 
Singapore	great show isn't it oh yes ya great expectations i like the music a lot huh you like it's really good ya uhm i like the part which where she where finn was sitting in the gallery and then there was this lady singing soprano orh so opera music orh she just comes ya lor just sings like that i remember you laughed at that part ya why do you like that why there's no reason why   laughs  very cute  laughs  i mean i mean she sings like that but the voice sounds like it is from all over the place and the whole thing ya uhm ya i like the scenes how how they construct the things when it's out in the open in the buildings there's always leaves falling even though you don't see trees oh ya hor everything just falls and falls i like the beginning ya the sea so calm and then it was so frightening when suddenly this prisoner just jumps out from the the the the seabed  wah so scary  oh ya ya  true ya and it's very touching lah how someone who is poor and yet so kind at heart you know when you help the prisoner at first and he doesn't just meet him with the with with that what is that thing called the the pliers ah oh the pliers ah to to break open the the chains you know ya ya loh he even brought some food food and and jim bean jim oh that was jim bean laughter  oh i see uhm basically i think he's very kind at heart lah finn ya tell me do you like the scene when they first kiss  laughter  the boy the small boy and the small girl ya it was so innocent the fountain right  nice right  so innocent so nice ya ya 3 times it happened is it first time was that second was in new york the same type of fountain that they first kissed on the third time ah underneath the water again but this time was the pouring the pouring rain ah oh ya they kiss one more time very passionately notice the difference the fountain the fountain and then the pouring rain uhm ya i mean i mean it's quite heartening to know you know from nothing he became somebody and he he manages to realize his talent  ya  in art in painting ya and so undiscovered uhm but he he thought he thought the the benefactor was the old lady ya correct estella's aunt  and word maid ya ya that's why he's doing this he doing this for her he's under the impression ya he thought that the aunt wanted uhm him to be on the the same level  same standing as estella  ya ya  so so that so that they can be together uhm so it's all along he's under this impression ya that's so sad aiyah but i like the first time uh finn met estella ya when she was only ten years old and he was seated there when she was well trained already  laughter  to be a wah don't know what monster uhm well trained by the aunt ya she i didn't like her look then you know wah she really looked so cold and like like a snob like what finn says ya ya i like the scenes lah i don't know why every every every frame well it's like a picture itself the rustling wind especially the old houses the first part okay everything looks  so run-down  ya so run-down but yet so beautiful in a way uhm everything looks like a picture it's print very very nicely even the part where the prisoner the final benefactor he died then the thing roll down on the floor and roll down on the things  one of their bottles  it's too beautiful and ya when he died you see the screen the windows behind see sunlight the buildings and trees and everything uhm but i didn't understand the part when the three big fellows or bad guys the bad guys ya gangsters they trying to kill the the benefactor  ya  he's trying to kill him correct they had something going between them he did say uh they when they when when the when robert deniro the guy was in his was in the his his his painting room then then robert deniro was just saying that oh these guys wanted to settle a score with me uhm it's an old score he didn't say it's like the past caught up with him it's just the past lah uhm ya lah robert deniro did a lot of bad things but he said that there's few good things he did one good thing he did ya which is very very nice  which was to help finn realize uh his talent ya i was so confused i was like wondering where where he got the notion that he likes to draw uhm oh ya ah then i remembered it was the it was the oh yes book it fell out of his hand into the water and he kept it ya the first part is so important when when finn was at the seaside and he just drew the fishes he saw the birds that he saw ya so touching hor robert deniro actually kept the book ya i thought it fell into the sea ya he was so rough then  laughter ya whisper whisper your name ya ya but very nice i thought very nice very nice movie ya especially the music uhm cause it's set in the modern time lah the books tells more ya uses the that so called different kind of english ya and that ah you see in the book does it talk about the upper class and the lower class of society hor  oh yes  oh yes so pretentious ah the higher class the buildings look so monotonous right you get the feeling the art gallery the buildings that you walk through the subway everything look so monotonous it's only when it's in the open oh yeah like the the it looks like the the water run down the leaves rush everywhere stuff like that uhm and how it comes it went one full circle when when finn comes back to his  house again to visit his uncle joe  ya correct  correct and how the benefactor appear in the first and the last part everything like a sandwich like that lah <$a < ya sandwich ah ya very nice uhm very nice quite a sweet show lah and   very nice  i like the part so touching the joe came back his uncle came came to visit his art gallery   oh the opening of the gallery ya and he didn't know how to behave and ya laughs  he was confused already he was like part of the upper class but uhm at the brink of it ya just ya it's very sad so although he realized finn realises his dream of bring an artist and and being so-called rich to match uhm estella's status you know uhm estella whom he loved very much right here he felt very empty uhm ya he felt very empty and he he he lost himself i thought ya ya ya he lost himself but his sole aim is to find estella his love   you know   ya ya  but why did tell me in the book why why did estella i thought they like can't remember laughs  they came to but why i thought they like professed their love for each other and then the next moment she left to get married with the   other guy   the other guy  maybe it's like what you say loh uhm she's just so estella is just so well trained by the auntie you know uhm to to so called don't allow man ah to to to hurt you  hurt man  in that way right right estella i mean the auntie became mad because you know she was left alone by the by the fiancé at the altar  correct ya  so that a lot of deep hatred for men uhm so train the niece not to be hurt by men in this way you know uhm ya something like that lah ya i get it actually come to think about it actually uh this movie speaks very badly about men leh  laugher  hah why why why so why i mean   don't know leh  remember the wo the lady says men are the bad things in life because she had a bad experience you know she was left at the altar but we don't know why ya but it's beautiful in that how i mean finn got got a chance to realise himself right he's quite innocent lah hor innocent do you think it's a love story also it is a love story lah to me to me it's a love story lor uhm what is it to you ya in a way it is it's about men men again  laughter  okay let it out an artist reborn laughter  ah okay but it is also about the prisoner you know so so called low-class you know did a lot of bad things uhm uhm and yet so although he's bad he can still do one good thing you know you know he help he helps finn to you know become who he is you know uhm uhm and yet the upper class supposedly to have everything but then they what good did they do  ya  ya they're so pretentious everyone dressed up in their black tie and like the coat and everything   ya uhm  and they make their stupid jokes you remember the part they asked asked uh finn how much do you charge your paintings by oh ya  laughter  by the inch or by the how long it takes how long it takes or by and stuff like that   uhm ya  so it says bad things about the upper class in a way ya it's pretty clear it's pretty clear ya clear nice lah very i find it very nice uhm quite empty right the lives they have the upper class   very ya very  they dress up so well but actually i don't know i kind of like that kind of life where you just go to seem just be with nature like what finn and and and did at the beginning you know ya in the beginning the narration was beautiful lor ya some some of the things finn says but can't really can't really remember but it says like you know that when benefactor experience uhm when he says like uhm like uh ya when you look from over her a little bit it's a bit noisy there   ya right  but i can't hear what he was saying oh ya ya he was saying something like let me think ah let me think uh oh after that benefactor experience when the small kid he says something like sometimes in life uh no not in life sometimes you have a look just a little brush with real life uh ya and that's when you really experience you know what life can really be that tremendous experience that he has as a kid when robert deniro like captured him and made him made him do certain things and things like that uhm ya that that i i i also like that part when uh finn says i'd like to tell the story not as it happens ah but as i remember  ya as you remember ya that's beautiful that's just like you right you like to remember things i mean you you that's how we remember ya what we remember is always the assets ya the assets and the beauty of it the feelings you don't really remember the actual things hor you know events and things like that  well so finally when he become so called successful he went back to his his old life and and and i think that's where he finds himself again you know uhm and then he went back to the the run-down house where he's supposed to do the gardening with the { once years ago { correct and then what did he saw what did he saw or who did he saw uh huh the little girl { again right { the little girl ya the little girl again don't tell me that's estella again ya but but the first thing he said was i saw her again i saw her again and he thought she was stella but actually she's a little girl who looks like 'stella when she was young ya some of the lines are very nice ah like uh i saw her again ya it set some expectations ya uhm and then then the camera like what you like to say ah the camera pans*** ah aiyoyo you know your stuff very well you learn thoroughly  laughter and the i like that scene ah the steps leading to the the sea and ya beautiful and then ghost feeling is gone birds are flying through the place ya uhm there was a breakthrough like there was a breakthrough like eh eh and then estella and him met again ya but that part when he says erm when when something about understanding each other at the end when they were talking to each other what is that it was like love like love first at first sight mm uhm say that uh like the like estella say that can you ever forgive me say that { don't you understand me { orhh then they look at each other without saying a single thing and the narrator say that she understood all along so in just very few words we get the idea it conveys the message that actually their love is so strong that it can cross class boundaries class boundaries uh years uhm yes ya many years many many years ya ya more than 10 years more than 10 ya at first i felt a bit sad because urm how come estella always promises to be there and then you know she didn't turn up you know yeah she never turn up for example the opening of his show his you know his paintings she said i'll be there and yet she wasn't there ya it was like the revenge loh orh remember uh 'stella's grandmother uhm uh forsaken at the altar the guy never turned up so it is the same thing here uhm art gallery supposed to be there it's a fulfilment of his dreams everything that he ever wanted but he wasn't { she wasn't there { she wasn't there uhm ya right it was like the ultimate revenge lah i see and instead she got married right ya that's worse right to a guy whom we can { tell she doesn't really love ya so sickening ya i like the part when give me your hand and he put the put it on the heart and say what is what is that he said wah and first thing as a small boy he said it was the boobs  laughter  ya when he was a small boy and everyone touches estella's auntie's heart so scared boobs lah boobs laughter estella says it's my heart sure and it's broken and it went full circle again ah ya ya and she realises how much it hurts and she i think she was quite regretful also uhm for what she has done to him the aunt the aunt ya that's why she knows how what it feels ya to be the other side 'cause ya ya ya loh and he she said i'm sorry ya ya that was quite touching so all along it was her doing uhm uhm quite interesting show lah not bad talking about it is fun lah ya hor uhm but so few people lah maybe because it has been running for quite some time lah actually two weeks only leh two weeks only hor two weels only so sad but ya especially the music lah i think very nice music really good uhm very nice music ya censored lah hor sad laughter  but it's okay still quite complete in its ways makes you want to read the book hmmm maybe one day i'd try i may try is it difficult to read uh ya { a lot of details a lot of details { not really not really orr i read some of his stuff not bad ah charles dickens i read christmas carol that was that was cute not too bad so i think can understand it's quite good lah it's quite good because it it brings out the the deep feelings ya of uh love revenge wah estella's auntie is real mad  laughter  ya that was very nice portrayed like what right it's like what the book described you know uhm sometimes she'd just wear the wedding dress again ta very crazy very crazy ya but she always act this kind of role one lah is it who is it her name is anne bancroft uh orh always act crazy is it ah old lady patriarch-type lady uh very eccentric orh ya  laughter  he she acted in a role something like that and won won best supporting actress before orh orh years ago this show called the graduate orh the graduate orh she's the one ahh she was the ya the old lady okay the old lady kind of the old lady kind of thing uhm

says no it's not and i think he felt kind of awkward cos' he didn't know how what to say ya he doesn't know what to say on the phone so wait wait wait i gave up word  it was quite funny i thought ya lor i know word  i'll sleep a lot lah in the afternoon you do ah  word i get up and do work oh about six six seven plus oh dear so is this your nap time huh no lah it's okay ah i've a essay due tomorrow oh boy i've to hand in tomorrow as usual i'm working on the clock oh boy but tomorrow is saturday ya it's always due on a saturday whoa you see the course is quite teruk 'cos i have to oops i have to like uh hand in assignments uhm uhm as well as um uh do my teaching practice and then it's not like you just teach from the textbook you know got to prepare lesson plan detailed lesson plan work sheets word  eeks quite artificial lah ah hah quite challenging uh that's good are you all into your practice kind of ya i'm doing the t.p. now teaching practice oh ya at that school that's near to your place right ya lah one term for one term i don't know whether to stay or not you know to stay at as in what stay stay there teach there oh cos' they actually need teachers there ah hah actually for sec one and two how do you like it there it's the usual government school lah i mean you know what i mean right it's the usual ah ya  word  so far i've been quite lucky you know i got all the good teach uh students oh that's good ya but i won't be teaching them you see if i stay on oh i actually wrote to rosie about it you know uhm about two weeks ago i wrote i think then she replied quite fast so i just got her letter i think yes ya yesterday last night uhm uhm ya she wrote to me i got hers some before chinese new year uh uhm you called her ah no no i didn't i wrote to her i think we should call her ah so terrible but do we have her new number no right ah i have one number but that was from quite long ago that's the old one nuh ya ya i don't think we have her present number come to think of it never mind lah just writing is is uh it takes long enough ya and i don't write very much lah terrible no time ya haven't written to word leh i've got about ten letters pending  laughter  yes but you've been writing to her quite a lot right that's good you know that was i thought it's six something word  last year ya it took a lot out of me ya then quite good lah i mean because she always talks about what other people are talking uh doing that's what she tells me to i think she keeps more she keeps in touch with them more than  word with me i mean you know what i mean right ya like keeping in touch with everybody else more than i do ya ya i think same place here ya so funny hor so she's feeding us all this info she knows so much about what's happening ya lor i don't know i've never been so busy before in my whole life okay this this course uh is really too much lah when is it going to end uh march march we're having exams ah hah which is quite soon nuh it means i'll finish teaching practice early next month uhm uhm then after that uh one week to study for a test for an exam ah hah then after that followed by another exam ah hah and after that we'll be posted out to schools already boy they don't give you very much time to study uh ah ya lor it's so weird lah the course because this is the first batch and then we're like the guinea pigs you know so uhm they they i think they couldn't really figure out how to what to do with us lah so word then then they cram the whole thing lah they treat us like some don't know what like that cram us with a lot of things uhm uhm and then try to make the course sound so professional and then after that you are thrown you know like no holiday no no real break lah uhm uhm except for last month i mean december uhm ya so quite pressurising lah the course oh and you're kept on your toes the whole time lah but how different is yours from the ones that the previous years right ya the previous years they take one year you know exactly and then they got holidays here and there ah hah ya then we we start immediately we don't have a holiday before we we go to school for for real you see uhm uhm ya so we start immediately lah but isn't there like the march school holidays or something like that ya lah because the following the ntu course i mean the course structure you know i mean the what do you call it cur uhm curriculum curriculum structure or whatever you call it ah hah that means it's you know like it starts oh ya the calendar it starts in jan uh ju july right uhm uhm then after that they finish in march uh very march to have exams then they have holiday until the next july right uhm ya for us it's like we start in july then we march we go out to school oh so it's like you're working round the whole year you know welcome to the working world ya quite teruk ah but at least june there's the holidays right the school holidays ya lah ah then that's not so bad lah ya lah but ya lah as usual you know things start happening nuh and then you get posted into i mean you get uh volunteered into things you know like all these uh sub-committees lah especially for young teachers oh yes yes yes ya lah then you really that's what i heard actually a lot of the teachers feel very unhappy oh all these extra duties uhm but then can't be helped what somebody has to do them and it's usually the new people who get assigned all these extra stuff right ya lor ya because they say oh you're not confirmed yet so uhm you know you better prove you know prove your ability and then the principal seems uh principal has more power than i thought ya so they can do what they want orh ya principals have quite a lot of power recently it came out in the papers didn't it something about donations and stuff oh ya lah that that one actually i ya that's very common right you have heard stories before but now it's like out in the open yes that's right but the amounts that they come to it's quite quite large ah ya i didn't expect quite so much some into the tens of thousands my goodness just to get your kid into the school maybe that's why they're losing teachers i don't know that's a lot of teacher ads recently hah on tv yes oh ya ya because it's now is the right time what soon they'll be i think they'll be putting out the ads soon uhm for ntu i mean for ie eh do you know this uhm there's this girl who did english ah her name is uh something gopal lah not sure what gopal do you know who she is no doesn't sound familiar ya she's now a hod at this school right oh hod ah of which d she's from our year you know but i think she has some uh teaching experience before that lah then she went to n uh nus to study oh ya so she's actually older than us lah i think so but i'm not very sure she looks quite young actually uhm uhm ya she remembers joan you see oh so she thinks very highly of joan then because of that she also laughter she's been treating me quite well oh that's good hod it's not too difficult to become one right ya rosie said that they have to have don't know five years working experience anyway it's a it's you know like last time you have senior assistants right uhm uhm now they don't you know and then in schools so they have these hods lah and they're not just head of department you know like humanities arts maths etcetera ah ah hah they also do all the administrative work you know oh boy ya all the admin work that's like additional work very funny huh and they give you a nice title to it lah ya lah and then you do all the other stuff rosie was offered that post wasn't she she went for the training ah hah ya then i think she's a bit too junior so if she continues for maybe another year or so i don't know oh maybe she could have got it i thought she didn't want it you know huh ya but but actually ya she didn't sound like it was very great ya that's right so it was like purposely don't do so well ya so you won't get selected type 'a' but you hear anything else from here because the letter she explain mostly replied lah to me ah hah  word  ya they went on they went on the europe tour and lost their luggage oh oh ya ya she mentioned that ya one luggage right it was stolen on the way to rome or something like that ya aiyah what a pity eh but she went around quite a bit ah uhm in europe yep  hah not bad hor that's right so fun can play with snow went skiing went skating serious ya aiyoh aiyah should have known nuh he's very active right ya

handouts instead oh i see ya uhm and you haven't managed to find a relief teacher for them yet oh no well did you calvin says no uhm uhm he signed up for the research scholarship uh huh and uh he says that most of his honours friends he can't really can't say anything for them in in august and july uh huh uh huh ya i see uhm uhm well uhm but the permanent teacher and the principal hasn't mentioned anything to me you see uhm uhm so it's like kind of thick skin if i were to ask them uhm actually i met sim lyn the other day uh huh uhm i was down at mph and she was with mike and she was buying a wedding card uh have you seen her recently no do you know that she's cut her hair really short that's what she's been telling me that by the time i see her i think it wouldn't be that short any more uh huh and she was saying that mike doesn't like it that much and prefers  word  really he or rather no what she actually said was oh uhm ya he he says he can't really get used to it and she said something to the effect of people prefer the previous length so by inference i took it that he didn't like it that much oh i thought he liked it and i thought she said he liked it i can't remember uhm anyway it's very very fresh-looking but very i don't know i still liked her with even-length hair see when i asked her she said she looked like su ya that's about word you know uh huh ya so that was when i really imagined it off the ears uhm uhm uhm oh did you know that i cut mine you mean since i saw you at at the sso uh huh and i told you i was going to cut it oh gosh so you cut it word  uh huh it's the shortest i've ever had oh no is it layered or is it even-length uhm it's well i'm trying to keep it all over again so it's it's levelled up to half my chin length and then it's a gradual slope down oh i see half my chin length uhm well it's you know what that means right i think i know what that means uhm uhm uh uhm oh dear aye it happened a mixed bag of reactions the the those who need it ones after the cut uh came from those who liked it then after a while those who kept quiet are usually those who liked long hair and the boys oh i see your students uhm uhm uhm uhm the girls oh so nice cut and the boys switched off and cut your hair uh why uhm at first i was so proud you know i went i went and i looked at my sec two boys and i said at that time it was their exam so i said hey my hair is even shorter than all of you uh huh oh gosh it's not that short it's not oh my boys have got longish hair they do during exams now they've got to shorten all off ah i see okay nobody word for them during exams uhm uhm are we going to any more concerts aye not now uhm uhm now i'm saving up for my trip ah no wait wait wait what trip oh i didn't tell you uh not yet well i've signed up for a mission it's kind of like a mission trip into uh we're based in hong kong but the mission trip's into china oh that's wonderful uh huh uh huh but it's so scary it is scary well it's a holiday if it's uh out and out holiday then it's not scary well i've got a bunch of people who are going to the jungles of kuching oh dear that's even worse you know travelling from mission post to mission post uh huh in the jungle uhm uhm uhm okay mine isn't that ya yours sound very very civilised enjoy yourself uhm uhm how long will it be uh thirteen thirteen is saturday and my flight is like seven

haven't done very much uhm uhm uhm uhm and uh you can start praying yes i will okay uhm uhm into china uh oh my gosh was it troublesome getting your passport to because you see uh the usual passport has got something saying that we're not allowed to these countries right so so uhm the visa and the entry permit ah i see but no problem lah actually ah just a couple of pages you need to to fill up and get endorsed oh okay uhm uh word and i didn't realize my passport expired i mean i knew it had expired but since my accident haven't flown with it uhm uhm i went to the office and i realized oh no mine is so huge uhm oh sharlene called me last night oh i haven't heard from her for months she must have tried calling other people before she got back to me uh huh she is like uhm help who's that that protagonist in look back in anger look back in anger john osborne uh huh uh did you tell her did you tell her anything ya i i juggled my book oh so who was it huh wasn't a jimmy or johnny or

thirteenth i sent her a card uh huh wait did you say the thirteenth of may ya oh dear i think i met her around there and didn't say a word uhm ya let's see well she says that she's been saying and actually that we should meet up for tea uh now it's like maybe when she finishes her stint you know she's teaching right uhm yes she was telling me uhm uhm uh huh at saint margaret's right ya ya and i think she's due for a ie interview one of these these days uhm uhm like this week oh i see but actually i think it should be no problem oh dear so fun the two of you would be in ie together that is that is if she accepts it oh but uhm she sound pret sounded pretty fixed about accepting it right uhm uhm uh huh and where are you in your uh progress urk i just finished chapter four uh huh i've passed it to dr pan uh huh and she asked me where what are your guiding principles what are your main issues i told her well i don't know oh don't worry that's what patke asked me at the end of my second draft oh no and it's rather demoralizing isn't it sorry it is demoralizing ya it was very but after that it was okay uhm okay uh huh uhm uhm so do you work on campus or do you work at home oh i work at home because of the computer but i just popped down uhm now and then i saw polguere the other day uh huh he's back uhm and apart from that i haven't seen anybody in the department they're probably all on leave yes dawson is on leave i think uhm uhm dawson's always on leave uh huh during this time uhm uhm probably back in europe at least i think so i think i should think that he would want to go back to europe that's nice uhm uhm in this heat yes oh i met bruce martin the other day too he's leaving soon no wait you word was taught by bruce martin were you he taught me in year two uh yes and he asked me he was just saying that he'd forgotten how hot it was in june and he's leaving this sunday to go back to iowa i-o-wa i-wa ya i-o-wa i-o-wa okay aiyoh oh uhm uhm how's brenda oh brenda is fine uhm uhm uhm uhm oh that reminds me i've got an overdue book i think it will be overdue by after tomorrow ya oh so are you coming down ya as soon as it's possible i suppose if i can by monday so i don't have to pay so many days oh okay uh huh uhm uhm you're going to be around i'm going to be around today  word  yes and after that i really can't say uhm uhm uhm uhm oh i hear from sharlene you're going to the london  word ballet oh yes that oh that means she's been in the room uh huh because you know i've got two tickets to word uh huh uh huh because i i i got thirty dollar tickets and forty dollar tickets so i thought it's easier to sell off the thirty dollar tickets and so i put up a notice on the board in the room oh you mean you you made a duplicated word meaning i bought i had four tickets and i only needed two oh dear yes well you can try kumu she's kind of idle right now oh does she like ballet do you like ballet yes i do um ah but when is it uh this is the twenty-eighth of june oh so i'll be around eh uhm uhm uh huh how much oh thirty uhm oh that's a thought it's up in the circle uhm one of my friends told me it's okay seats uh huh uhm i'll be going with andrew on the same night oh on the same night but different seats yes uhm uhm just different seats uhm and uhm ya it's at kallang it's at eight pm oh it's the romeo and juliet one uhm yes i was more attracted to the next bill oh yes the one with transfigured night but i think those are completely sold out uh huh ya uhm uhm i thought it would be uhm we tried the only one my friends tried to get was the dallas symphony oh and tried to get oh okay tried to get and then for the rest of it i thought oh give it a skip  uhm uhm uhm i was talking to another friend who was telling me oh he's going to see the indonesian dance uhm uhm in the gamallon and nuh he was saying and he was saying that ya these are the tickets that are more available then he says singaporeans are so snobbish uh and i kind of shrivelled in my feet no uhm it's not that singaporeans are snobbish that i think those who are trained to those who go to ballets and all uhm uhm and music halls they're all western classically-trained so so i i think not exposed enough to indigenous cultural works you know uhm uhm ya and well uhm uhm did i tell you once i went i went with my entire bible study group to the glass orchestra the glass orchestra uh huh and because it's some um experimental group and highly experimental and i kind of knew uhm that i forgot you see so i said 'why don't we all go ' and i booked tickets for all of them and they almost died because oh because the trained ones uh two most accomplished ones almost died because it's like nothing orchestral that they know it was that spaced out uh huh uhm and like 'what orchestra ' it's all broken pieces of glass oh that's why it's called the glass orchestra ya so it's like actually they tried to pattern um the the the glass instruments um most of which were fashioned themselves they tried to to group them into the different sectors you know like the conventional orchestra uhm uhm according to i don't know the pitch or something uhm and their works were original too so you've got to like throw away all the conventional ways of listening and listen according to rhythm you know uhm uhm and i found it very interesting because i could pick out when one movement ended or one piece ended and another girl who's like absolutely tone-deaf sometimes and she's not trained you see and she's not very exposed and she knew when it ended but the musician friends of mine my goodness they just went 'to hell with it' was it bad wasn't it enjoyable um it's enjoyable if you listen to it with a different ear uhm so they were going 'i like brahms so what am i doing ' oh poor things ya but i was quite mad actually because it's like you're you're just cloistered you know instead of broadening uhm uhm well uh different different ideas and i think all that talk all that reading up on post-modernism help uhm uhm uhm ya by uhm by the way ya this is a recorded conversation ya i figured ya by the sound word she's going to have a lot of giggles cos' it's something as natural as it can get i can't i can't i can't control it oh same here ya i kind of word  how in the world do you transcribe giggles do you just skip them or do you put in bracket giggle ya wow wee she's going to have a lot of brackets wow okay like in the middle of a sentence

living uh once when you enter your door and you shut it off you don't see each other you know but would it be worse in a in a terrace house or in  word  but but terrace house uh at least uh when you come out to the garden or you dispose off rubbish at least you can still catch one another you know oh ya  word  ya that's true actually you know what or not it's only the maids who are merrily having a great time you know i believe  word  i believe ya the maids are having a great convivial time word how come uh they're on a lookout what they're on a look-out for for the kindred spirit sharlene

two intellectual  word ya i said  word he did he he or she didn't hit  word nail on the head you know so i said i said no lah come on you know but then i said ah never mind lah then she say you tell him okay ya my conversation at this point in time is far from being intellectual no but actually what i i don't know what's her real purpose it's maybe just to maybe she's word  to see how we tick maybe or i don't know maybe you know like after all we we got a particular lingo and then she just want to to analyse it who cares it's all anonymous and then hah you tell her you tell her it's two market ah soh having a swing lah you know ah you hang on a minute my my daughter is is playing word  ya go ahead beneath the blanket aiyah she's yes clever girl ya word  and what about your daughter

would say ya no truant you know but here a nursery even if you don't go for three days i don't think they miss you ya that's right i think they or you miss anything it's not word  i did but the word nursery teacher is more glad to see you not not there you know i know say thank you very much don't come or something ya ya ya ya ah by the way you know what happen i was so zany uh i didn't register bee joo you know word i thought registration over already but let me tell you it's fine you know huh because this is not an important year you want nuh hit you hit next year k1 really uh no word  frankly speaking whether yi nang wu zip bor zip teochew  doesn't make any difference you know frankly it's just that uh the reason why we want or rather i i want ya mine in is just to interact but if i wanted to go and do abcs and all that ya i'm so used to do it too at home ya she's beyond that actually right i'm sure word too ya it's more for like interaction and things like that it's so you know yes it's true ah but you're you're you you you're not late you know where where where tell me uh chapel oh chapel ya chapel i thought they they take a lot of chinese is it yes seventy percent why not man come on you know word  bee joo will be actually uh i i i kind of i told you right uhm i kind of like have chapel earmarked you know but the minute i got marymount i told myself aiyah forget it

bee joo or not i do not know why don't you try how how you try to you you go there and then beg and beg and and and kowtow uh no lah no lah don't do such things and then do what you just go there and then uhm uhm but they are a bit tied right now because all i know is that they are full-house you know ya but uh next year k1 why don't you just put your name and then and and then see how ya no but 'a' pauline you say you're going to put april in that pap  word  what happened  word ya the pap thing is like you know you want nuh go you go you don't want nuh don't go as long you pay monthly they don't care whether you turn up or you don't orh like that so you got her in two places uh no i got her in pap now what pap is now oh pap is for when she's started   word now now has she started it's supposed to be every morning from ten to twelve so suka suka if i feel like it or she feel up to it she get gets up on time i'll bring her there oh you mean our little darling has already started on

you are 
Singapore	hello hello is pui yoke there speaking and guess who am i uhm word  oh boy how dare you how dare you call me i have a proper name okay guess mui in ya so how are you doing uhm busy busy lately my directories have all come in so i've to mail them out huge pile oh boy so you got any help my sister uhm not much of a help not much of a help i mean two of us that uhm well no you can you can nuh threaten to uh uh fire her maybe she doesn't do her work oh i mean i'm sure she will but then uhm for two us cos it require a lot of manpower and a lot of marker work uhm uhm maybe you should get my boss to do it yap but i already scare her a bit ya i'm trying to get lay peng to come back to help out also uhm uhm  word because of her expense ya right or maybe once in a while when she needs a break from her books ya then well so what's new other than work well dr word has been keeping loads and loads of rats as you know uh do you know that seow choo is now his uhm phd student is it yep he's doing his phd under him under who dr tee oh boy that's in uh that's interesting i mean it's oh actually she was an ra right ya she was an ra but uhm word  was she working for a degree then or just not no she wasn't she wasn't and they uh actually she was supposed to be hired under him uhm uhm as an ra but i guess they wanted to save cost and asked her to convert it to a a phd by research uhm uhm so she's looking around for a scholarship oh i see  word  uhm uhm to buy more equipment uhm uhm are they actually working on the same uh they're working on the rat word  uhm uhm uhm oh about uh the wednesday evening's dinner i probably not join you oh why oh oh actually this week i'm really busy with uh work to complete and i guess i shall miss the fun oh you mean they've been uhm pushing you and all that no no no but uh there are some things i need to sort of sort out and no i just in the process of sorting out the stats all those uh terrible stats pile so different tests and all that uhm uhm ya oh so i thought that i should spend more time on it but don't stay too late uhm well it's nice but it's quite uh dangerous for you to go out late at night in that sense not really because i can take the mrt from my uh from the the bus-stop outside the engineering blocks the mrt uh sorry i mean duh i'll take ninety six and then i'll go the mrt station so it's not that bad it's not like a long walk compared to before and i had to take like one nine seven 197 one nine eight 198) uhm ya sounds ya word  uhm but you still do you still have to walk through that little path with the palm trees and all that palm trees uhm or i think coconut trees oh no no usually i'll go by the uh on the the sixth level where they have the yellow roof you know that part uh is it i mean the palm trees is where uhm like near yih right ya uhm i don't go through that way oh you don't go through that way nope oh it's the one that's just uhm opposite arts is it uhm opposite o what arts uh uhm central library uhm ya ya ya right uhm uhm ya so in a way it's quite convenient ya so long as i don't go to the thirty three 33 bus-stop i feel safer you know the one that's behind the one that's behind uhm uhm the one that's uhm like you have to go down the long flight of steps and then you go through i mean it's like with all trees and bushes and oh ya uhm so uhm uhm so what have you been doing besides work well uh guess what for the weekend i spent the entire weekend sorting photographs oh for me to see ya sort of uhm i'll probably bring them in one day and trying to find one that has got a clear picture of the the the face of a girl i told you about oh so that uh you'll probably be able to see it better uhm because the rest of it are pretty blur oh how come ya uhm guess not well taken and i don't have too many of it oh i only have like uh maybe one or two clear ones okay so word so should i expect you to carry in a big note oh no no no i'm just going to bring maybe one only one nuh i thought you'll show us your album oh ya i can  word  i can but not i mean the rest will not be on her though the rest will be like uh very scenery sort of un you know crazy things that i did oh but i want baby word too oh well i don't have any you don't have any right not even one no the oldest or rather the youngest i have is six so if you consider that as a baby well never mind that will do i can imagine my little exhibit ya right oh okay someday i'll bring it when will you be coming down again uhm don't know not at this point i guess maybe when i start working at nuh again oh will it take long hopefully in the next two weeks oh that depends on how fast you finish your analysis is it uhm uhm i see or rather depends on prof ong oh when when he decides to have space for you uhm uhm ya at first recently they've been having a lot of short courses and speakers from word and all that uhm uhm  word uh he's always showing people around uhm oh and and dr ng has been using the room quite frequently uhm uhm so even if you come i think you'll be slightly disturbed by him oh oh there's this group of students coming in and word but i guess i won't be using much of that room because uh since this is going to be at the workplace you know the workstation of whoever is going to participate uhm then so it looks like most of the time except for the uhm calibration which can be done not necessary in that room uh huh it can be done outside too oh and the rest of it uhm who will done at the subjects' uh work workstation and so you'll be running around carrying all your equipment and all that uhm ya maybe or rather the subject will be running around ya with the electrodes on i see oh but do you have to bring a new brief case of electrodes and stuff like that uhm you mean over to nuh from here uhm no to your subjects uh no no no they'll be in other words uhm after they finish up their calibration which you know i could always do it outside uh uhm near where you work uh huh then uhm after that she's free to move about and this time it'll be quite different in the sense that she won't have those uhm like the angle equipments attached so she'll only have like uh six electrodes attached to her and that's it ya so probably will be word on made easier for her to move around uh huh ya  word computer to monitor her movement and all that oh she has to cart that around you see ya but that would be placed at the workstation oh at uh huh you know where wherever she works get them to provide you with the laptop ya that was what i was thinking maybe you could borrow one from your department  laughs  uhm uhm ya it'll be a lot more convenient than carting one  word  ya in fact the spot i used when i was in nuh hp oh that's because alex is there and then uhm uhm  word give you laptops and all that  word  uhm uhm ya  word probably a personal laptop well you can ask you can borrow from dr tee he's got a new one and he's quite happy with it oh dear well it's a macintosh uh huh  word  oh he has got every all the new facilities ya it's like he's so augh i can't stand him well does he still play that games and make those noise uuh the singing and occasionally hoping that you're not around oh uhm good after-work entertainment ya and he finally finished his notes so he can take a breather for a while but hadiah says she's chasing him what notes uhm for the short course he helps out in the short course his lectures and all that hah uh huh so he has to produce a set of notes uhm uhm so hadiah has to chase him each time for the notes because it's late oh boy he probably has too much to say but i mean he actually he's involved in so many things he's got so many projects running at same time ah and and he's also got a uhm poly student attached to him uh huh for i don't know what they are doing but at the moment the poly student is doing a lot of calculations uhm on molarity oh well in a way it's good it keeps you really you know involved uhm otherwise well make good use of his brain i asked him how come he took so many things then he said oh he just want to test his limits see how far he can stretch he ya precisely after all he's talented so uh gifted so so you know got to squeeze every bit out of him ya i guess it's alright for him because he's still single and all and all that uhm if he has a family it can be quite word  uhm uhm yep and besides uh well he's young and energetic so uh uhm but now that he has got a new companion ya the cassette i don't know how it is i must go and ask him what happen word  i haven't seen him the whole day today uhm uhm oh do you know that uh bee lan has given birth who oh oh bee lan for one moment i thought you're referring to the other bee lan word  wrong bee lan the other bee lan word  uh oh i see so is it a girl or boy a little boy uh uhm and then the baby was two weeks overdue uh i think oh uhm uhm but i think it's uhm they induced the birth uh huh so it's quite okay in fact she had

Singapore	hello hello may i speak to alvin please uh who's speaking please  word ganesh oh hang on uh thanks hello hi alvin huh ganesh here ah eh you know what time haresh coming down uh supposed to be four at four o'clock ah ya four o'clock ah okay you'll be down at because he didn't call back you see so we can't reach him already oh okay but does he have the budget and all that for the next production or not i don't know lah don't know ah ya ya ya okay okay because the thing is i just want i need need to know roughly how much it'll cost lah i can give you a number lah i think so ah can nuh maybe we can work with that lah ah i think we can ya i think he has something in his head okay we work with that lah  word after the discussion what we can do is uhm maybe type it out tonight and fax it for so you know ya it's like followed by the thing you see ya followed from the meeting and then word  i see so but i don't know whether he has anything uh written uhm ya uh you know that's true lah ya so maybe today in the preliminary kind of thing lah uhm ganesh will be no problem lah no i just he uh he uh he's got some ideas and maybe want to like work out hah work out something uh okay that shouldn't be a problem oh ya before you put down the phone i must inform you ah that uh our conversation is being taped okay no why you're trying out the scene is it ya no why aiyah we have a friend from english department uh huh she's doing a study on singaporean english lah oh okay as as people talk over the phone so unfortunately you have been selected okay for this project and so this conversation has been taped lah okay lah uhm this is all in the name of academia yes  word  so should be no problem ya the person is an ex-teacher who is the ex-teacher she also like us oh i see yes taught and left really uh ya today i just got the the letter from the ministry what acceptance letter is it acceptance of the resignation and that but you have no bond to pay right orh oh no thanking me for my money i paid to them the bond oh you paid not word  how much uh mine mine is about five k start off okay lah that's not too bad lah  word not too bad not i was word  ya anyway you have the freedom lah you have the freedom to do what you want now now uh i agree uh how were the reviews of the word so far okay lah so far i enjoyed the show yesterday uh huh i thought it was quite good yesterday ya okay lah ya so far it's been positive because there are some people can't make the link orh orh orh ya i don't know what the link is lah but i assume it was trying to show that if your foundation not strong in both cases you will collapse or something like that uhm that that that can also ya and some you will have someone that is uh the strong will survive ya you know ya there are so many ya  word someone to link i just want to see the parallel between the two situations lah ya a lot of people left without realising what happened no but uhm what we actually we haven't yet experiment experimented as in asking people two days later uhm uhm you need sometime for it to sink in  word ya lah i told uh we i don't know yet ya if they can come to a realization two days later ya they can still find for me because ya as you're watching it it's just word  ya it may because you're too engrossed with the show right and everything else in it you know ya ya you still don't want them to make the analysis then correct ya but i don't know you see actually it's basically what we're trying to put in of course is entrapment entrapment nuh ya because getting uh because we're thinking of re-staging it so what we want made clearer uhm could be the the you know that the trap lah because  word physically trapped and uh kim kim is trapped by singaporeanness oh i see word   word she got to pay for word i got to go i can't the difficulty of letting go the ya you know alan breaking free going correct ya ranching going out of the house etcetera all a lot of uh and the idea of uh uh death uhm father's death that traps her growth the the the people death that word  ya taxes lah in life in in living in singapore also maybe nuh being trapped by your job uh and you can't word  ya you know actually i think the play itself has a lot to offer i'm i'm glad you're you're planning to re-stage it lah ya i think too many of these plays here get done once and then get shelved and not you know not done again nuh uhm it's a pity ya so we must get the audience who can share uhm after that we you know see how lah see how which part we want okay lah more you know which part because you know the part where they they caught and jean cried out then you know i will die then i can walk through word  ya correct ya you see and so tonight we're going to uh we're make we're making jean say that earlier oh because as the overlay takes place uhm uhm uh audience gets caught up with the effect rather than the content you see i see so we want to put that earlier uh slightly earlier when the word  ya correct that line is often left i mean it loses its impact ya ya correct so maybe it is not that the maybe it's a bit of the script a bit of the delivery uhm uhm uhm so you word with testing the the script out ya i think this' the best time to test whatever you want to do right huh fairly experimental at the moment ya ya  word  but i like i like the show lah i i thought it was quite well produced ya  word the effect the first night my god the audience i know wan hui was telling me the audience were were they were laughing at every line tuesday was a more you know more intelligent audience ya because they followed the play ah the first night they even laughed at the singlish oh god  word so they laughed at everything oh you had the whole of sbc people at the back what friday background sunny lim and all that ya who are there  word  so they were impressed they did ya is it ya what did we do we didn't know about the feedback lah uh because some word i was walking out they were talking to me because they knew i was working oh ya with you ya word whether i knew inside info oh most of them didn't catch the parallel you know most of them didn't ya they enjoyed the acting ya they enjoyed the acting the enjoyed the performance as a whole but the parallels i mean they're intelligent to make correlations lah but you know like never show whether that was what the playwright wanted to come across or director wanted to come across so kind of like that lah never mind lah okay that one that one we can we can we can ya handle lah you know ah please please call me and tell me if uh when the next uh rehearsal is for that one ya ya okay thanks a lot nuh i hope you don't mind this being used for as part of her study uh ya this whole thing uh ya ya she's still taping it okay then okay ya so thanks a lot alvin bye bye  i mean every weekend huh every weekend we're paying interest about is the tape running already uhm uhm hah whoa so fast uh at least

Singapore	his name is ken oh ken what ya like i don't think it's ken tong oh whoever word will say ken tong ya lah ah don't be silly uh ya anyway so he was like talking about work and all and he was not doing his work he was reading up books on japan oh so i was like ah even i can tell that you're not doing work but he's nice lah uhm ya lah he looks quite okay he's marianne's colleague uh uhm uhm ya don't know in what capacity i think we must really ask marianne word  oh oh ya what's she doing uh her her job sounds like fun you know research uh oh uhm actually she's i think like secretarial or administrative support to to her boss lah ya what what's what what is it doing are they a research group or what uhm oh andersen consulting does uh these you see they have clients uhm uhm and the clients ask them to do computer packages for them or uhm training sessions and stuff like that uhm uhm uhm uhm so they have to present proposals and all lah so he will i think provides uhm support lah administrative support uhm uhm uhm ya like uh maybe when they need certain things then she like when they need you know information on stuff like this she'll come down and get it oh so fun so ya so the main actually the main bulk of the work is done by con the consultants oh  word consultants they pay them quite a lot so i i hope will will get to be one lah ya i hope i hope ya so actually ya so she said see how lah so consultants are the ones who actually do up the proposal you see uhm and you know get the information and write up the stuff so i think for her she just you know provides support lah so she does the running about and gathering the information lah uhm i don't know about the running about this is the first time i've heard her coming here to get information ya ah i think probably the consultants have to do it themselves uh eh so fun uh i hope one day she become a consultant ya i hope so too anyway ya it sounds pretty interesting why don't you go into that too ya i can do research but then how uh maybe they want things like accounting and and management no i don't think so they take in they they take in ba people as well how lang lang lang also ya i think so ya eh then maybe i can ask her ya ya ask if there's vacancy and you know just write in your resume and then or or if there's vacancy suh  word itself ya and then ask them lor uhm uhm uhm i think should be quite fun uh ya should should be quite fun and they pay quite well so and that's only for an ordinary degree so if you've got a masters i think that will be worth something ya maybe maybe i could  word  so so how did you go to the you're going to the cash-on-line right oh no i didn't go ya i thought you i forgot all about it because she didn't bring her tickets what oh yes yes so do you want to go or not you don't want to go phantom of the opera no lah i i really want to go but you know i word  that's no problem not liquid at all lah  laughs  totally not liquid lah i'm so sorry aiyah eh i'm so sorry you know we forgot to ask my sister about what about the ribbon the ribbon oh no it's okay anyway we met marianne so that's okay uhm ya i wanted to ask you also about your your sister whether ya we spoke with her after she met jokim and how she feels and stuff like that ya ya ya so so okay she called me lah ah and then she just like okay she she she she likes jokim because she can talk to jokim and everything lah uhm then i said like so how's how how do how do you like the hairstyling you know very good uhm she's very impressed but then i think like make-up she was like i don't know what she was looking for lah but actually like i mean what do you expect like miracles uh i mean what do you expect like like those tsk you know those artists uh those paris make-up artists uh like super-models uh ya those models uh ya ya i well i don't think the the photos do a lot of justice to the make-up lah but uhm i think it's also very important to remember who who the models are you see i mean because they are like normal you know ordinary people ya ordinary people you see so it's not like i mean not exactly like your ah lian ah hui that sort lah but you know ya but ya ya so and sometimes you can't expect miracles really i mean of course you want to look good you know but uhm ya and then some of these people may not be photogenic ya that's right you know so it doesn't come off and you you don't have all those touch-ups and photography ya ah tell your sis if she wants uh ya she can come over to my place uhm and have a look at my dayspring album ya ya ya okay ah because uh then you know to see if she wants before if she wants uh that sort of photographs before she signs up lah otherwise uhm uhm uhm you know if it's not to her expectation then you know seven hundred and ninety dollars is a lot of money to spend for that ya then she can also see the make-up i i really like dayspring's uhm make-up artist did really catherine uhm no no that one is uh lancome that one is separate that one i got for the day orh but uh the studio one because mine was a whole package and nuh it was together with studio make-up as well eh uh uh uh so the lady did it very nicely i was like whoa can't even recognise myself uhm ya ya i saw i saw  word turned out i think the photos turned out quite quite good lah ya ya so uhm ya if she wants to you can ask her lah word in fact i think i think your photos you look very good in your photographs ya i mean in the studio photo i take uh huh yes yes yes yes not like myself like that so like whoa okay ya enhanced lah enhanced lah remember word  ya but hans oh oh enhanced enhanced hans like ya hans like goldfish eyes he can't get over it so like so sad because he's really the photogenic one you know i'm the one who's not so i say oh you got no problem lah you know so when the photos turned out it's like why am i like staring like that so i've to find excuses you know no lah maybe sleepy that day no maybe headache lah maybe he should have looked into a flower word  looking ya he's word disappointed but i mean i still think he looks good ya because he's really very photogenic when you take him un unawares uh ya he comes out very nicely uhm uhm for some reason or other ya that's why i told you lah when i pin up his hair quite good some some people it it's it's like this you know whether the camera likes you or not ya ya some it's like turns out really good and also i think it depends on the photographer's skill and the kind of background uhm like uhm there was once i i wore this red dress uhm uhm uhm uhm to go to this friend's wedding so she took photographer like uhm i looked normal lah you know goggy uhm and all that when i went to take then the same day that afternoon uhm uhm i went to take uhm a passport photograph and uhm my ic photo  word  ya ya oh ya you're telling me very nice ya then like ya quite good so i thought ya i suppose it depends on who's taking it as well as ya the kind of uhm background that you have then ya lah a lot of factors ya whether it's outside indoors or outdoors so all that burn must bear in mind lah ya i mean she can look really wonderful for studio and she may look really wonderful on that day but the photos may not turn out that well you see ya i think so you know that's true ya so just tell her to be realistic and wake up you know ya lah that that's it like she must she must do her research all lah ya i guess she's a because she's not so too keen on on jokim no she she she wants she she's gonna ya she she's not too like wow about his make-up but she she's going to take him on and oh she's going to take him on nuh if if since he agrees to take her on so okay lor uh okay fine like jo quite funny uh like he just decides okay six hundred dollars maybe he's been calculating you know in his mind ya no actu i i don't know lah i think based on what i know of jo he will like look at you and and the person and he thinks that he can afford it he can work with you and ya i mean word  your budget lah uh and then of and then he will like talk to you and then if he thinks he likes working with you then okay you know he doesn't mind the money is not that important ah but let's say if you know he doesn't really like you very much uh and he thinks you're very calculative and all that sort of thing uh he doesn't really click with you then i don't think he will give you the the discount oh i think that's how he works i mean i i haven't told him this lah but i've been observing him you see aah so but he's mighty generous ya he's he's quite fun lah i mean he will do do that for the sake of friendship or for the sake of you know ya ya of feelings lah you know you qing that type of thing orh ya yau qeng because ya ya oh because like ya when he when i first met him i thought like he like quite business-like i thought ya but then later on he like kind of warmed up lah ya and became himself and showed us his topper i like was very shocked like he really went to the room and take out stuff and like showed us like eh ya ya i like word oh maybe theresa and him are in and all right ya like maybe like you know very good friends ya mean like he's never done that lah normally we are quite sane i mean how long ya quite good friends you know i think you all share a lot right must be on christian stuff uh ah ya i mean we just we just talk lah you know and he's like quite strange because there are some things that he knows and there are some things that he doesn't know like siblings he thought was like you know sons and daughters  that's children  word sisters ya he's so cute or something like that lah you know ah like when you say psychosomatic word uh like what you know but i i like that about him because he's very frank you know and he doesn't like uhm ya put on airs word  ya un unpretentious lah ya he's quite unpretentious so ya that that's why it's fun and i always enjoy my my sessions with him even like now when i call him i'm quite scared because it's like what you feel you know like he's a bit stand-offish ya even when i call him it's like uh jo i want to cut my hair then he like uhm okay let me see and then he like we never joke and we never like talk properly over the phone you know ya ya it's just like a business transaction then uh when i  word  that was how my sis ya ya ya it's only when i see him then okay you know i will like oh talk to him lah then he'll be okay ya so he's that sort lah because word like oh hello then wasn't like very friendly sort ya ya like oh no he doesn't warm up to you word  ya he doesn't then i like oh no maybe i was rude somewhere i like ya i know i feel that all the time huh it's like maybe i was imposing on him or like sometimes when i go down at five minutes late or whatever it's like i feel so terrible you know ya then like oh nev' mind it's okay okay i mean then he started  word / sounded word so so you know like discouragingly and ya so like i feel like maybe ya maybe i've offended him maybe he is angry ya maybe he is he is angry ya exactly you see but after that he'll be okay 
Singapore	hello hi are you asleep yet hi naw going to a little bit more i would have knocked off okay are you i can is she being recorded now okay ya you're being recorded already whoa being recorded uh okay ya okay so you have to start telling me all about what you've been doing during your holidays oh ya i've got to start telling you what i've been doing during this holidays uh not very many days are there  sighs  no you mean when kim tok went away uh uh holidays began already what kim tok went away on saturday night ya ya so they were on holiday already right oh yes ya actually they were on holiday so far actually what what did we do to them uh but did he take leave no he didn't oh i see but what he did was that you know he stayed back in the morning like worked here two hours while i went to do my driving i told you i took my test failed you know ya that's right that's right so the last week everyday i was out on the road oh i see i see so you mean you had like intensive training during the ya i had i had a full four days or five days prior to that lah oh and then there were no baby-sitters because all the all the navigators staff girls were in camps in church camps and the navigators camp and teen navteens camp you know  word camps you know oh oh ya that's right so i told him please lah just stay back and nuh just keep an eye on the kids and work here ya that's right ya actually they're alright you know ah just need somebody to keep an eye you see that's right so he worked here and then he went to the office so let's see uh but he took one morning off to bring them to the beach uh to catch crabs uh oh ya lah that's right ya so but then before that how did you do your driving oh i've word twice a week only you know oh then how did you do it when uhm oh word benjamin is in school oh i see i see uh ya so you had to arrange it lah ya so i don't have to arrange it because benjamin goes to school so i timed it such that uh i will come back in time to make lunch for him you see ya he comes back by twelve so that means the instructor will come and pick you uh no no no i go to the driving school to uh i word  driving from driving school oh i see and then they'll take you on the course ah then they take me on the course lah oh i see ah then it's a one-hour forty minutes deal uhm so hundred minutes so i'll take a bus to the driving school that's about twenty twenty-five minutes and then uh where is that bukit batok you know near julie's house oh so it's alright lah ya very near uhm uhm so i'll come back by the time when i come back it's time to get lunch ready and then benjamin will be home lah that is the reason oh i see but it it costs a lot nuh huh cost a lot uh does it ya i'm sure ah ya anyway ya that's right because like now the whole thing i think you know it's so costly thousand over you know ya thousand over so if you have to take it again no need lah actually see the school is uh one thing that's good about them uh uhm what they do is that they bring you uh for the circuit and then uh it's about how many lessons uh i was i was a bit slow lah uhm uhm you know i think the younger drivers they learn it for about half far far faster than me oh i see so you mean it's all in whether you take it again or not and all that no actually it's up to me the base cost is the same uh no no it's up to me you see uhm uhm for example i took about thirty two lessons with them you know uhm uhm uhm so but out of thirty two lessons uh fourteen lessons uh uhm uh fourteen or sixteen i think half of it or more than half were on the circuit you know oh i see that means they teach you do all those parking lah all those  word  ya which is the essential lah ah uh huh ya and then uhm the second uh half of it nuh was on the road oh i see so after that you see at the at different stages they pass you you know uhm uhm uhm you must pass the fourth stage uh uhm must get less than thirty points before they allow you to go to the fifth stage you see oh i see then when you finish the fifth stage uh you're supposed to get less than twenty points before they allow you to sit for the test you know so you never had to go on the road lah no i went on the road oh you did i did you know so that means you did pass all the stages i passed all the stages aiyoh so right now uh when i sat for the exams uh ah ah they thought that i should be able to make it lah fifty percent lah ah ah ah ah you know as good as that i see i see so now that i fail ah i can just go back to school and take one lesson you see oh just the minimum of one only i see i see no but what i mean is that when you go through the test suh uh huh you have to start all over again yes yes oh i see no lah but i think you shouldn't take just one you should take more than one because it's a matter of practice but you know it's so costly you know i know but then the thing is that driving is practice you see just more time uh ya it's just practice it's not because you see even if you pass uh by chance uh uh huh then after that you're not that confident driving on the road too you you still it's a matter of practice it's true you know ya so that's why actually you might as well put in that effort and then get it through you know ya rather than because if you keep delaying it also that's true ya because when can you take the next test august my next test is in august oh so between then and now i mean you you need at least to drive a couple of times a month i do need uh ya i do need so what i was planning to do lah i thought what i'll do is that since i have learnt the basic skills from them uh uhm uhm i use the same skills and go to a private one that's half the cost you see ya ya i see you know that means what i need is i i just need confidence on the road yes yes that's right that's right you know the circuit is no problem ah ya i didn't even get a single point in the circuit ya you know i mean i it was okay you see ya ya that's right parking was no problem even ya so i just need that confidence uh half hour oh you mean this one you go the one you go to is actually ran by the government it's not a private one it's a private one you know oh same lah but it's a big private company oh i see but uh they don't allow you to take more than two times a week you know oh so when you book with them uh you only got maximum of two times a week to take you know oh i see so the private one it means it's cheaper is it uh the the private one is cheaper private means individuals lah i mean those uh you know that you used to learn from you see ah ya lah that's right whereas the school lah they already had a system lah you know they have already worked a system as to how ya you should drive how word you should see it oh ya what you should notice lah i mean they almost like basically train and instruct you ya it's quite professional lah ya quite professional you see uhm uhm uhm but i think one of the disadvantage i find when i uhm i took a private one for about four times lah ya just to ride drive you know and see what's the difference you know uhm i think in terms of uh skills and technicalities uh uhm the school is superb lah ya that's right they're they're really superb on that ya uhm but the problem is because they're so trained to teach you they don't give you a chance uh to think you know uhm uhm to decide for yourself you see ya that's right so when i drove on the road with this uh private one uhm it was very good i mean i i i applied what i learnt uhm he didn't say anything he just let me drive uhm in fact they were so confident i'll pass all of them i think god just doesn't want me to kill anybody on the road or just kill myself kill my children whatever ya you know no i think it's basically uhm ya just more practice that kind of thing and you have i mean the confidence is also gained through driving it often enough that's right lah ya i don't think i've got it often enough that's right so you probably just go to the private one and get it you know a couple of times a week ah word so i've to just to keep up the momentum ah i mean it's far cheaper anyway i mean it's about uh well how much twenty over dollars uh twenty over for uh one and a half hour session you see whereas the school is about forty eight you know that's over twice ya terrible uh when i was learning it i was like paying the most expensive school lah lambert's last time uh word  oh lambert's uh how much was it ya eight fifty ya i know per hour that kind of thing in fact somebody was telling they only learned it for five dollars you know ya but that was ages ago lah ya probably kim tok's was free free ya because he told me how did he learn driving uhm  word malaysia i think what he did was that uh he drove around you see ya that's right so came back here he took a a driving licence and passed you know ya ya that's right because he's confident on the road you see that's why i remember some people who ride motorbikes and all uh uh after they uhm you know they want to go to get their licence uh ya they they learn it very fast because you kind of have a bit more road-sense already oh ya that's why so i think i'll i'll press on uh because i don't think i want to give up the only thing is that whoa ya no you shouldn't i mean after that all that money you spent on it already no thousand over dollars now you know ya that's right ya so   word  it's a matter of just you know keeping it up  word  it's only a pp uh that you know private cars you can't drive huh otherwise it's you know it's a matter of practicing that's all it's true you know ya it's true ya but anyway i anyway that morning when i was doing my quiet time uh word  uhm i mean the lord gave a verse of psalms forty two 42 says 'by day he will direct his love at night he he gives me a song' uhm and i thought it was quite good because uh you know the the meaning of the the fact that he directed my his his love towards me uh uhm by allowing me to fail was quite encouraging you know uhm then after i sent kim tok off to the airport it's so funny i was i didn't realize how tired i was i was so geared up for the whole week for this test suh ya that suddenly when when uh i i went to the airport after the whole thing was over they told me i failed it was very nice you know uhm this that this instructor was saying 'oh no uh we regret we can't give you you know' uhm this time i'm i'm sorry and i got thirty one uhm i felt so relieved then but i went to the airport i was so tired and sleepy uhm sending him off i went to buy uh duck duck rice from the shop uh uh then this man gave me back my change you know ten dollars uhm give me four dollars and i was looking at the money i wasn't actually looking uhm i was looking and not looking you see ya and he thought that i was questioning his integrity he said 'uh isn't it right isn't it right ' i said 'no no no ya it's right i'm not looking at the money i'm not thinking i'm just tired you know' and then he told me say 'i teach you how to do some exercises these are chinese martial art exercises' he word  oh he really did uh yes he's so sweet you know he said some he gave me a name of the what he said 'i i practise this and it's very good you know help to revitalize your your your zeng san uh uhm they call zeng san you know ah ah ah so i say 'oh' so i told him 'no lah no lah anyway uhm i'm so tired because i just failed my driving test lah' uh you know i just came and sent my husband off but i failed my driving test uh so he says 'how many times already ' i said 'first time' 'aiyah first time no problem very few people pass first try' ya that's right i passed my fifth time okay 'a' but good lah you pressed on ya and then this tun tun passed first time because he quarelled with the instructor or rather after that he told the instructor 'come on' he argued and then he got through because  word  you know last time it's not so scientific you know oh it's not point system right oh ya ya ya it's more a bit more judgemental so he argued argued argued and he came back he passed no but now they're quite strict you know they're quite fierce about it you know ya that's right now it's more scientific you see ya so it's more difficult in fact they don't put any ar arguments and things like that you know word  ya that's right 
Singapore	how come i i don't know i called leave messages you don't call back for one uhm i got your message today uhm the other day is the day of the seminar which seminar oh and what did i do then

ah uhm but subject to a lot of revision after that still ya you don't get the first draft done you never get anything out that is why ya how how are things otherwise are you okay uhm okay lah bearing up lah ah hah ya i mean i don't really feel comfortable talking about it over the phone so when i see you i'll tell you about it lah ya okay ya but other than uhm workwise i guess like i manage to buckle down lah ah hah ya ya i tell you when i'll be able to see uhm let me see uhm i've got to take ravindan to an uhm he's starting a new class this uhm this uh thursday speech and drama really nirmala's recommendation whose recommendation nirmala's recommendation really ya because often she says he really enjoys it and that it's very good so he's starting today they just had a vacancy uhm where is this held it's uh you know judy gabriel have you heard of her no uhm okay judy gabriel's communication you can have it word through off kampong java road oh ya that's at four-thirty today

actually i'm free actually you are tomorrow ya tomorrow will be okay okay actually the old uhm my ministry invited me down for some opening of an art centre i see ya but i am not going lah the way i see it i think it's just crowd filler lah they probably can't get enough people to come down you see i see ya unless it's it's useful for you to make contacts or something my you're laughing at me i'm sure something's so fuuny yes it's like with those people are you kidding me after i left i think the last thing i wanna do is to look at their faces again lah ya don't go there ya uhm maybe around three-thirty would that be good for you three-thirty ya we can go for coffee oh ya definitely if you see her ah ask her discreetly who is that ravindran oh he screens all my phone calls word  ya he ask me who was speaking i said indra said who so cute aiyoh okay when can i call will you be at home or will you be uhm on campus i'll be on campus lah okay if i call you at this at this number uh ya okay if i can get away tonight i'll give you a call but don't think it's very likely no i don't think so it probably will be too rush for you anyway ya ya how's shuba anyway oh better now much better now last time i spoke to you was she ill uhm no you didn't tell me anything about her being ill uh well she was she's feeling better now oh my results are coming out next week i know next wednesday ah

think it's in the afternoon oh not in the morning no shucks got to wait another half day okay i'll wait for your phone call ya i think ya lah i'm sure if i don't call you robin will beat me to it lah well i've already i actually you know even before we took the exams i made him promise to call me i i didn't want come down and look you know ya ya ya they sort of been seen word  a lot of people just hanging around outside the notice board this past week oh well some of the faculties have released their results already i see ya oh well okay ya i'll call you next wednesday okay see you tomorrow then okay bye bye  aye haven't heard from you in a long while ya i'm doing a lot of things lah like what i wanna to go and watch movie what movies did you watch uhm i went to watch much ado about nothing oh how was it okay lah quite fun lah how but quite cony you know in what way uhm it's not so shakespearean nah but it is quite modern and then then uhm go and watch lah it it's quite nice i mean it's different from did you watch hamlet ya ah i didn't watch you see so from what i hear it's different from hamlet lah ah not so elizabethan you know what i mean ya ya who're your favourite actors in that ah movie favourite actors ah uhm think denzel washington lah what did he act as act as uhm the brother what's his name ah oh don penrole uh then uhm the villain is he he's not the villain right no don john is the villain okay ya so aye i went with audrey ya so quite fun lah did ting keat go ya ting keat went also how did she like it ya we were laughing and laughing all the time ya then i was thinking of going to watch uhm another film probably this week or next week lah uhm but haven't decided on what to watch okay ya have you watched any lately i haven't i've been working so hard on my masters and all that haven't had time lah oh how is it coming along uhm i was having a lot of problems with it but now it seems to be coming along fine i think i'll be able to finish lah by the deadline so what chapter you're on now uhm finishing chapter two i'll be starting on chapter three next week oh so have you passed up chapter two no i'm passing it up today lah oh ya uh first draft ah uh ya first draft but i don't think he'll give me much problems with it lah uh how long was it about eleven thousand words eleven thousand quite okay uh ya how was the first chapter oh he passed it he said it was okay he said okay ah and asked me to go on with the rest lah uh that's means you're left with the third chapter lah ya the no the third chapter is uhm bessy head then after that is anita desai oh that means two more chapters that means you're doing four in all ya what was the first chapter the first chapter was the introduction oh i see so your the second chapter was tony morrison ya i see so how how you gonna to bessy head and uhm anita desai i don't know i think bessy head not much problem because i've already done the work lah ah you did a draft already on her anita desai where i have to work start reading from scratch it'll probably take me about three have you read any of her works at all ya i read all her books already i just haven't read the critical readings lah ah hah will that long or not i think probably one week lah and then another week to write and then the third week to amend lah it's not that not impossible lah now it's about september it should be okay lah ya now you should go out lah hah you should go out ya you haven't gone out for a long time ya how uhm how is shin lan have you seen her lately shin lan haven't we've been putting off all our i mean appointments to meet how come a lot of work lah ya then i mean she's been busy cause her her dad is like you know coming and going coming going you know then they're trying to get a flat ya where are they trying to get a flat uh queenstown they haven't been successful actually they book one already and then and the i don't know suppose to be like ready in three years lah in fact actually they have gotten the flat but it's just not ready yet ya and then also like she is living on her own now now that her auntie is not there anymore gone gone away so she's there alone nah ya and then i think also like because she got her own you know her own commitments and all that so we haven't been able to meet up lah ya so i don't know but i haven't heard from julie either ya don't know what what is she doing lah julie is in n u s now right ya you mean she is doing her first year or second year first first year ya you mean you don't see her at all ah no i haven't seen her at all and we were supposed to meet i mean she's in university and then i told her i said maybe i can come down one day you know and then i guess she must be quite busy lah ya and then she's in science right sorry she's in science right ya she's in science ya is the science department quite far from the arts department i'm not sure i haven't i have never seen it lah oh fine so actually haven't gone out much with my friends lah but uhm on my own i've gone out quite a bit uhm you know i've been sick as well ya then how is the rottweiler oh okay but he seems to be having a skin problem how come don't know his he keeps biting and biting ya i think he is allergic to something lah uhm but he's good lah because like having a big dog uh after a long time we've had you know just a small dog and then we our other dog you know pepsi ya after pepsi died then we only had one dog so i thought it seems my mother is at home all all the time and none of us are in so my brother brought uhm a rottweiler lah ya ya you mean it takes what it really looks after the house ah ya but when he first came here rod you know we're disturbing my brother we said he bought a kitten instead ya ya it didn't bark at all ya but now he's he's a good watchdog lah ya ya but i guess also it is so hot nah he tends to be quite uhm quite run down lah i see how come ya because the heat i think the heat gets to him he he wants to come in all the while 
Singapore	hello hi ya oh hi how are you fine oh so what are you doing i was marking my papers oh my literature papers ah hah ya oh just took a break lah just now so have to go back to my work how many classes do you have to mark three aw this is not so bad ya  word  next week monday oh next week ya so uhm monday is okay because i i don't have any papers tuesday my paper start coming in ah hah then i don't get any till next monday you know so stupid the way they planned it so i have all my papers next mon the following monday and it is like five sets of literature and two sets of moral education ah hah so i i have so much to mark on that you know during that week terrible oh ya i am not looking forward to it sorry anyway this whole week you know i will be so free oh you know what i mean because i would have marked because the paper i am going to get on tuesday is not too difficult to mark who does the scheduling the head of department hod lah ah okay ya but i i don't know i see if i can't cope might  word tell her and then maybe second next term they can uhm do something about it lah ya well guess what i am looking at at the moment uh ashley yes he fell down on a couch uhm bas bask in the uh in the warmth of the house uh hah tell you this chap is something else he is so naughty uhm uhm why he refuses to take his medicine he is having fever uhm we brought him to dr lim on monday uhm uhm that well because of two reasons he slept the whole day on my mother's bed oh well he found a new place to sleep and then not only that in the evening when sandy was eating don't know what he did he went near sandy of course you know it irritated sandy and sandy snapped at him and he had a deep gnash-like thing in the nose oh so my parents had to bring him to dr lim uhm i find him better now when was there blood or anything ya there was oh he has recovered from his fever he's not eating as well though uhm uhm we are just hoping that he is going to become better because the doctor has also given him tablets which you know increases appetite uhm so when hopefully he is going to eat more and become and strong cat uhm he is sneezing at the moment and it's so funny you know he behaves just like a human being the way he looks at you really the way he jumps off the table and and you know he walks upstairs uhm and he sleeps on the bed uhm uhm i mean it is uh the and the people at spca came it seems they came yesterday and they wanted to see it uh ashley oh and my father said oh he is he's not feeling well and he is upstairs sleeping on the bed so the the officers said oh very lucky cat sleeping on the bed  word  he is jolly good that is all he want to check oh they want to see whether you are taking care of it ya oh and it is funny because they didn't check on on uhm sandy because pariah word cat what uh sandy sandy which one is sandy uh pat and daryl's dog oh i see they didn't check on him uh really they also got it from spca yes and they are checking on ashley oh because it is pedi pedigree is it patrich word pedigree cat yes and no i don't think they make uh you know i don't think they make a differentiation but i think it was i think it's something which they just like they take a hand random lah ya random check  word pick on you know uh they just want to check on on the new you know adopted uhm perhaps uh ya jolly good sleeping on the bed  word sleeping word  upstairs would you like to word on my wife's bed oh sleeping on bed oh very lucky cat oh not to worry we want to go word  aiyoh ya lah your cats are so lucky lah hah the animals who live in your house are just just so lucky they must have been they must have had very good lives that is all ya i was going to say they must have been good human no they couldn't have been good human beings cause then they wouldn't have been animals right no there is another theory that you cannot sort of uh you cannot sort of uh dig word what is there such a word as degress re regress uh ah regress from a human being to a animal you cannot uh no oh means you can come back as another human being ya but you will have a more difficult life to i see you cannot come back as an animal no you can't i have been telling my students cause we are doing religions right so i mean my understanding is if you you if you are mean in this lifetime you come back as a cockroach or something like that so i was telling them no no ya see i am telling them wrong things  word coming back as a cockroach but have a harder time as a cockroach oh aiyah that is so silly i mean i mean which cockroach has a good time which cockroach sleeps on a bed know what i mean oh ya i have heard there are some but not in that sense you word talk about it it is like why like everyone has like a set of like seven cards in life how is that your set of cards are different from the set of cards that someone in calcutta has who sleeps on the road uhm uhm you know what i mean it is like i think some things cannot be explained i mean i wouldn't want to try to explain it i mean i i don't think that in other words i mean if there is a life before it is possible it may not be possible but i think word it's just a theory but it is quite likely you know that there should be cleared  word live word before if that explains why you know our lord now no i don't think so lah ya there it it explains what they cannot change like for example you know our family why are we born into certain family things like that ya uhm social economic sort of you know conditions but of course that you can come out of it too uhm uhm you know and there have been cases of like you know like tan tock seng was a hawker uhm uhm  word vegetable seller well this is a hawker i guess same and uh you know and then he went rich word  there are lots people like that from rags to riches kind of story not lots lah carol quite a lot right i mean i mean there are just that we don't know like especially those back those from china and all that ya when they in to first work now they they have they own land and  word carol no buildings and stuff historical evidence shows uh shows that uhm historical evidence uh points to the fact that very few actually have made to to the upper echelon most most of the collies that came here well maybe they became middle class over uhm uhm generations but they didn't like become rich overnight not overnight lah of course not overnight they worked very hard they as word individuals did did not uhm uhm but their their the generation that follow after them uhm ya so you have got very few cases like people like lok yoon uh tan tok seng they came from china now very few of those who like come out make it to the top uhm uhm very few it is more likely that their descendants uhm hopefully do something about it uhm uhm ya i suppose ya well our pastor don't believe in reincarnation uhm ya ya i think it is possible i don't think so  word not possible either whichever ya i suppose you mean you can hold to your own beliefs lah but it is just like god i mean sometimes you man i mean oh did you read the latest readers' digest oh on what steven hawkins no his his uhm his book the history of time no that became word  that is the latest one is it i haven't read the latest uh hah no it is very interesting go and read it in fact one thing that led to the divorce of him and his wife was religion cause he never believed in a god apparently he is the greatest synthesis after uhm einstein uhm and uh oh is it the is he the one who is presen pra paraplegic yes he is ah okay he is very famous ya ya ya i remember the name ya steven hawkins ya if you read like the second part of straits times i think many a time he's been featured already uhm uhm ya so any way they made one of his books into a movie and oh did you go to for the film festival no did you uhm no but adeline went for one of the opening uhm uhm one of the opening opening shows ah shows the crying game oh ya it is suppose to be you you saw it right i saw it ya it is it's one it's one it's in the you cannot tell me the ending right you are not supposed to tell me ya it will be kind to me i got to see it eventually lah you have to see it word  ya the thing is that i don't which theatres though it's kind of obscure places no lah there are all sorts of interesting twists to it uhm you know it is like it is very british word you can imagine uh uh you know the british coming out with something like that i is a british film you mean it is a british film oh ai yoh my friend went to see it and she said it was very good also they have you know you said it was very good so uh ah ya must go see it lah i figured that we get movies like after two months uh after america has it ya uhm well it is better than those days when you used to get them about one year or two years later really remember those days it was like we get it so late ah right six seven about a year later we get the film oh ya but now it is almost quite quite close  word little mermaid little mermaid uh hah we have it in just after because when i saw it in the states i mean then i came back my goodness after several months they showed it i thought this is dingish word  in the states they already have it on video tapes oh and the people here are watching it in the movies uhm uhm crazy i guess there is a backlog of movies to be shown you see so backlog i mean uhm because we've always been behind time right no you know what it is like there are so few movie theatres 
Singapore	we are not having a formal debate we feel very so what are you having uh just an informal discussion informal discussion uh so how what kind of informal discussion you uh uh is one side going to raise a point and the other side counter counter yourself or what what are you going to do i mean maybe we could just tell you what uhm what we have to say and then you know if you have anything to to add on or to ya you know uh uhm okay who's uh supposed to propose my the three of us three of you right three of you all okay so speak when you are ready we shall start with the definition of code and we define code as being uhm oh ya from code uh he says that code is language and dialect and it includes even sign languages also and from word he says that code is uhm a series of signs right and its uhm correspondent between form and meaning ya and uh and this excludes uhm the type of moral and uh so uhm so uhm we think that uh it is not enough neither is it sufficient sorry it is not sufficient nor necessary 'cos you have to take context into account like uhm context will give you the utterance meaning for example uh the cha kway teow you go to the cha kway teow man you said one fifty he'll know it's uhm one fifty worth of cha kway teow but if you were to go out and say one fifty to any passerby uhm something will happen i mean besides besides that uhm local and geographical variations uhm for words like uhm gas and petrol uhm is american but petrol is more towards singapore so uhm if you use the word gas in singapore people might think that if you wanna buy you wanna you know order a tank of gas for your kitchen stove or something so different ideas behind the words and uhm like gail was saying for the word home different people have different ideas or different values attached to it right because they experience uhm it differently i mean in the sense that for some people home would be uhm very good uh very happy comfortable sort of idea whereas to some other people it might mean uhm like uh a broken home where beatings and drunken well whatever ah you know that kind of thing ya so it depends on experiences also say opposition what what you want to say to their points so far uhm i think what gail says contradicts what shirley says because gail says that uhm in the definition of code you exclude world but then according to shirley uhm context would therefore include world so i think that's contradiction there and uhm ya but we are sup we are proposing this motion right which should that we are we define the motion as being a correspondents between form and meaning and we are saying that world is important also so that's why context's important ya but just now you exclude world you said ya the definition of code ya that's why that's why we are propose ya it's not sufficient not word you know okay okay uhm i'll do on that word our definition right uhm when you talk of code we would we also refer to it as a system of uhm meaning and form correspondents and uhm our code can be verbal and it can be non-verbal is that uhm when we talk of verbal code we refer it to the same language and non-verbal code will then include things like signals sign language body language etcetera and when we talk about shared code uhm one question that pops into mind is how shared is considered shared right uhm we'll like to define it as when two speakers uhm share a shared code they have to be both uhm possessing adequate knowledge of this language in order to understand internal assumptions utterance meaning sarcasm idiomatic phrases etcetera so this will constitute what shared means now uhm for necessary and sufficient if you were to refer to kobe for logic uhm logic uhm what a necessary condition would mean would that be that it it's a circumstance in which uhm word absence the event cannot occur that is without a shared code putting it in this uhm context without a shared code we cannot have human communication right another example if we were to look oxygen and combustion we say that oxygen is a necessary condition for combustion because without oxygen no conden no combustion can take place now if we were to look at sufficient condition a sufficient condition would be a circumstance in which in whose presence the event must occur for example if we say that uhm combustion occurs then uhm oxygen must be present but oxygen is not a sufficient condition because you can have oxygen being present and yet no combustion so a sufficient condition would necessary uhm necessarily uhm uhm entail a subset of necessary conditions in that in this case if you want condi combustion you need uhm you need oxygen and many other things many other things so what do you understand laughter  thank you so what we are saying is that uhm for human condition uh communication to take place we need we need we needs uhm we need a shared code but this shared code is necessary as well as being sufficient but being necessary is a subset of being sufficient you know alright if you were to look at the true table can can i draw out the truth table by all means okay uhm laughter  if we were to take necessary condition as p and sufficient condition as q so uhm we do it this way so if p is necessary condition ah p is sufficient condition and q is necessary condition neither necessary nor sufficient will be not bracket p or q so this case is true only when both p and q is false so uhm if you want to say that this statement is true you have to prove to us that it is not necessary as well as not sufficient but what we are trying to say that is that we are we we we can prove either of this three cases see we can prove that it is just necessary or you can prove that it is just sufficient or you can prove that it is both necessary and and and sufficient and ours case stands here okay okay laughter  right and the last point is uhm for human communication when you talk about human communication we want to limit it to being uhm just effective communication in that uhm there must the hearer must decode the message the same way that the speaker intends it so that is effective communication uhm so so that's that uhm word  we are not saying that shared code is sufficient we are saying that it is necessary that means it encompasses it can encompass other things as well you see in fact in our definition of a shared code we've already included right we included non-verbal communication utterance meaning so so the world is word we are saying that a shared code but you just we are not saying that in your definition you said that shared code uhm a code is form and meaning only you didn't say word  we we believe that it's part of it is an essential form and meaning you see but you're going to so you're going to have word column and second column yes because you see when you talk about under jakobson right if you talk about when he talks about code under the functions of language right he uses it as the language that is used you see in in communication and things like that and under that language itself right it is the verbal language right what you say to each other and also other uhm signs like non-verbal language communication as well as utterance meaning and all that it all comes under the heading of language you see and as a result it comes under the heading of codes that's how our definition comes about okay now if i may interject uh for a while i think this this debate is kind of a digressing a little bit from what you're supposed to be talking about ah this thing about the the code you talk about whether it includes the world or doesn't include the world it's quite a word point really it's not a point worth debating because you're given this you know in your two zero three you're given this form meaning well thing right and your your well from your reading okay you read it you read that shared code is a system a system of signs right system of signs and what is a sign a sign is a okay a sign is something which ties form and meaning right which is a you know the the classic sausurrean definition of a sign where you now when the the word sign is used by the structural linguists you know from sausure's time the way they use meaning there is not the same as this framework which you've been given two zero three this form meaning world this fmw thing in fact this fmw thing okay this is just an incidental point which i'm just saying to you now it's it's just an abstraction alright just a framework uh which dr ferris is using himself okay which i personally i don't believe in okay the kind of semantics that i do ah ah this to me this is this is bullshit okay but for your purposes for exam purposes you know if you  laughter  alright so when we talk about meaning in terms of uh the linguistic sign or whatever sign uhm it does not necessarily refer to just this this m alone okay could refer to to your w as well because when we talk about meaning okay in the sausurean sense it can be sense as well as reference alright it doesn't have to exclude a w so let's just get that aside for the time being okay now word okay uhm so now what you have to show as a proposition is that this this shared code uh is number one it's not necessary and number two it's not sufficient you have to show these two alright now so far you haven't really come up with any uh argument any strong argument you have mentioned something about okay the importance of context uh the cha kway teow thing right so that perhaps is an argument for why it's not sufficient but you haven't really argued why it is not necessary right of course on your part as the opposition uh in a way you have an easier task because right they have to show the proposition has to show that it is one word not necessary as well as not sufficient right you have to show both as the proposition as the opposition all you have to do is to refute just one of these you don't have to refute both right they have to show both all you have to do is refute one of those and your your case is done right so in a sense it's easier for you so it depends on what kind of argument you come up with who wants to take it up again okay in other words you said that okay talking about if i  word use jan jakobson's six elements of communication right he list down addresser addressee uhm sorry context message uhm contact and code as the six necessary constituents so you say that if you say that the code a shared code is sufficient  that means you are not taking into account the other five uhm necessary elements right so in other words you're saying that if i have a shared code uhm and i look at angie angie knows what i'm saying to her  laughter because what mental word thapy 
Singapore	i think we better start okay won't wait for boon lai okay shan't ask you about the question one where you're supposed to give me examples but tell me why uhm people say that spelling is inconsistent for example what do they mean you can have uhm two sounds representing more than one sound represent representing one uh letter represent or is it the other way round one letter can represent more than one sound ya okay for example like uhm uhm uhm car and uh treat and uh hit hate hat all using ah the ah okay  word  ser suan any examples  word country aspect how okay country and smack uh which one are you doing laughs  we're talking about how spelling can be inconsistent right and then uhm and then we say that it is inconsistent because we have one symbol representing several sounds so we've been we need examples for different symbols symbol as in a phonetic symbol uhm spelling right spelling symbol uhm sleigh and sleight sleight which sleight s l e i g h t is that slight or sleight whatever slight sorry laughs  okay what about uneconomical what do they mean  word it means a lot of letters take up a lot of space laughs  a lot of letters for what to to spell a word a word a syllable or sound a syllable a sound for example but think it is a ch that's if we pronounce it as cher but uhm you need two letters to represent it in phonetics only one symbol uhm not our phonetics though the american one right ya okay okay now if people think that spelling can be inconsistent and uneconomical etcetera what assumptions are they making about the relationship between spelling and speech question two they're assuming that like uhm pronunci uhm spelling must reflect pronunciation and it represents it must represent the spelling must represent the sound of a the spelling of a word must represent the sound of a word okay so it's like spelling should be phonological right okay so one letter should represent one sound now why did people have this assumption what gave them the idea that oh when you write you should ex exactly represent how you speak what are the different explanations for this assumption boon leng uh i think in the past they they always think that language has everything to do with writing so they always consider that writing is a i mean a a bit i think they're trying to reverse the word  slowly i think it's an over-correction now ah what does what does over-correction mean that means to say uh they they do correct these false notion to a to a very extreme degree okay so instead of saying that now we should raise the standard of ah speech to the standard of writing make them equal they actually make it even more important so now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech ya okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction uh they also because in the last in the past when they uh when they were learning how to read and write they they were using uhm i mean the students actually have to pronounce the word so for them uhm the words i mean ah they equate them with uh word  so uh but because the the kind of education uh system that we have nowadays is that we just look at the word and the word forms a mental impression on our heads so because the system is different i should think that uhm whoever is uh formulating this assumption must have got it from his ah learning experiences uhm uhm okay so the old habits of reading and writing affected their view of what spelling should be then one more thing about maybe they saw a very close connection between writing and speech and therefore they assume that it must be exactly the same what sort of close connection do they see between writing and speech soh suan uhm because word they use symbols to represent the word i mean the character which they are describing and what do you mean by symbols if we say symbols we can say the traffic sign stop is a symbol so writing is not like a traffic sign right what's so special about writing uhm writing has only one particular spoken symbol attached to it so in a way it's a very close link you see because the traffic signs they i mean you can see them for what they for what they mean but you cannot utter anything about them okay and also different countries can use the same sign but they can say that that sign is stop sign that sign is a sign for uh for vehicles to ting xia lai which is mandarin and all that right so what about the character ren that you saw well what about all the chinese languages do they pronounce it in different ways they do they do but how come your characters' the same uhm  laughs so chinese languages is uhm special example right it's a special example okay so if you think of stop maybe s t o p if an indian came along he can't pronounce stop in tamil i mean the s t o p right or he can't a chinese can't say anything right when he sees s t o p so in that way maybe they saw the close connection between writing and speech hello laughs  okay then let's go on to question four okay when we were we were saying that people have uh wrong assumptions about what the relationship between writing and spelling it's okay one thing was that they over-corrected their idea that now speech should be very important and language should written language should reflect speech another thing was that they saw a very close connection between speech and writing and so they assume therefore that they must be exactly the same okay so if we think that such views are wrong how do you think you can express the relationship better the relationship between speech and writing under true functions sorry they've close connection but ah they have speech and writing as different functions and they occur in different contact right so can you give examples of that different functions etcetra uh speech has uhm paralinguistic function but uh writing doesn't have for example what do you mean paralinguistic features uhm their gestures their facial expressions ah but you cannot uhm put that into writing okay that's one what else choon kiat uh speech most of the time it'll be uhm spontaneous whereas for writing it'll it'll be more of a pre-planned thing so you can phrase whatever you want to say whatever you put down on paper beforehand for writing a a speech okay and uh there'll be pauses as well for speech it won't be such a smooth flow as as writing basically writing would be for more formal context where where speech is more of a social sort of a context okay any other points boon lai have you caught your breath yet laughs  do you have any points uh just that writing develop because of a need for record right which speech could not do why not uhm speech is limited by memory and ya writing is not writing can be passed down to future generations okay so writing can be permanent and speech is transient what else uhm there is the distance factor between speech is limited by the range of voice but writing you know i mean is not it have it can travel greater distances okay that's not taking uh technology into account right because like people can say oh but we can call people oh ya and all that okay alright then five a what are the two major sets of principles from which spelling system of english is based is it etymology right and and and phonology phonology phonology okay so what about isomological the basis of uh the the the source of which the rest comes from dictionary uh so the the i think the dictionary makers they the dictionary wri the writers they they try to insofar as possible to trace the uh uh the etym the the root the word the etymological roots and uh as close a representation as possible okay so one thing is that it the spelling of the word need not be the latin form or the french form but then because they were concerned about showing etymology so they thought they should reflect in the spelling the source of which the word was borrowed okay so you have examples like island where initially there was no 's' right but they thought that it came from insular so they added the 's' but what about other uhm reasons for etymological spellings need it be a deliberate attempt are you are you talking about democratic nature that johnson fixed it etymologically because he could not decide on which one to use so it's like who did he follow then he followed conservative right so uhm conservative means it's not word it's not a regional variation of english so he he went back to the past okay uhm what about the very fact of borrowing a word from latin or french once you borrow you do you spell it your own way or do you spell it their way they anglicise it it's not the the their own way modified their spelling ah latin words okay what about french words like beauty cigarette when you see the 'ette' you know immediately it's not english it's french right do you laughs  intuitively maybe hopefully anyway so what about that it's not deliberate right they didn't say that oh we want to reflect in our language that cigarette came from french but it's just immediate borrowing right okay so there are different explanations for etymological spellings what about phonological how did that start uhm are you referring to ah older words which were words which were spelt in a way which was pronounced in the past like for example i think psychology was the p-s was was pronounced in the past right was it was it was it somebody words  laughs  what's the point then if that is the case i believe it's not to confuse people right like you ah it's been around for so long oh so you don't eliminate the p but what i thought about phonological is like to reflect an image of sound ya they want the the spelling to be an image of that sound right so the point that he was trying to say is that even though now we don't pronounce persychology laughs  in the past maybe they did but i think the 'k-n' one know ya they might have pronounced 'k-n' and then we stop pronouncing the 'ker' or something like that okay but then the spellings do show the previous phonological system okay but phonological system means that they tried to have a letter for a particular sound right and to reflect pronunciation so how did that start at the very beginning they didn't have alphabets right what did they have in old english time the runic system the runic system then who brought the alphabet romans romans romans christianity and christianity christianity so the scribes started using the roman alphabet then you think the roman alphabet would of course be used for which language latin so is the sound system of latin like old english no of course not so they must adapt a spelling system which is for another language into their own old english then what happened what are the problems that arise tracy the uhm the old english sounds didn't match the latin sounds so what did they do they borrowed the runic letters they borrowed runic  runic runic letters ya right that's one way and the introduce the word combination okay and what about the next page  laughs 
Singapore	where's your class alright let's get the attendance first ang kiat hin ang kiat hin ang kian peng ang kian peng malee yes you're here yes raymond goh alan chang tan fook cheong not here chan heng lim not here chan heng leong chan chee leong chan chee leong uh charles chan tan heng chee yes okay chee kia keong not here cheng soo huat cheong chee hoo should be here by this time alright uh chew kian hock chiang kit teong yes okay chew chiang seng chew seng kit chou eng hwee chou han yuan and chou yong meng okay the rest came this morning right take the nine o'clock one is it 'cos normally it should be the other way round you got two classes nine and ten usually it's the ten that's full and nine is empty these people can't wake up in time yes just now the nine o'clock class is more than full about seventeen okay right now questions one and two any problems with those okay any problem with those question one we have the application and s matrix to word okay for question two question two we've to find the unitary condition any problem with that no right so let's move on to questions three four and five the basic uh emphasis here is to make s matrix together with all other known matrices okay for example you have t z you have other matrices like in y your h your hybrid okay now we haven't got time to cover everything so for this particular tutorial we'll just look at this t matrix and the z matrix right i want you all to feel comfortable with s matrix i know it's a very new matrix that uh forcing on you all but i hope that after this tutorial you'll be able to see that the s matrix is but one out of many matrices that you can use okay and even if you start out with your s matrix and let's say you need to transform it to another matrix there is no problem let's say for question uh three or question four rather for question four you find that the t matrix actually is more suitable for practical application there's no problem as a conversion formula between the two so you can always switch from one to the other okay right so come in come in right first of all we try to establish the relationship between the s and the t and that's our question three okay now this is your two port network now two port network you find that to assume that your symbols are of these four okay with that you find that your sketching representation is just simply this okay now this way of writing things assumes that your a1 and a2 are independent parameters and your b1 and b2 are dependent parameters this is not unreasonable okay a network like this you ought to know what you are feeding your system with and you're interested in knowing how that system responds okay so for the s matrix that is our presumption we know what we have as input and we want to know the response of the system to the input now what if your emphasis changes what if you change your set of independent parameters okay so for this question we are going to look at the possibility that a2 and b2 are known right a2 and b2 are known and you're supposed to find a1 and b1 so in other words this becomes your independent set and this becomes your dependent set okay so let's get that from this particular set alright uh it's awkward to have your left hand side comprising b1 is your dependent but this b2 is independent so let's shift b2 over to the other side and uh shift the a1 which is supposed to be dependent over to the left okay so you will have right so let's re-write the familiar set of sketching equations in this form now once i write it in this form i can then assume that this is a pair of pair of simultaneous equations in two nodes if my nodes are b1 a1 this whole lot on the right hand side is assumed to be known okay so in that case how to get hold of my unknowns well simultaneous equations there are lots of ways of solving it let's use your kramer's rule okay word uh you all have heard of kramer's rule is it okay so this you can solve by kramer's rule now let's i won't go through the mechanical assume that we can solve it there you find that when you end up with this set of equations okay so you'll end up with this set of equations right what's so important about this set of equations  word  first thing let's change the symbols okay while you're sketching parameters we chose this set of symbols because they represent certain things now since i want to look at the same system but from a different perspective i have to change the symbols i let you change it to this big a1 big b1 and on this side i have big a2 big b2 okay usually written in this order now here let me fit this arrows for word matrix we normally draw in this  word  let me fit the arrows so that they correspond okay now what do we have here right we word it with a if there's a one-for-one correspondence so what you want you can change to big a1 small b1 you can change to big b1 okay small b2 this red arrow here i can change to the green arrow here physically it's the same wave all i'm doing is just giving it a different name okay giving it a different symbol so that means just a small b2 can can can be replaced by a big b2 and this small a1 here can be represent oh this should be 2 sorry this one can be represented by b2 okay alright uh this whole lot here can be reformatted in another form as another matrix okay and we find that if we call the new matrix t then i have okay then i have this new matrix which is your transmission matrix in that form and uh i find that uh there's a one-for-one correspondence okay if i'm given my s matrix and i got one more t matrix this one is given by this this is given by that and so on okay so here we have uh s matrix is given you want to transform it to the t matrix quite simple your t matrix is just simply given by one over s21 it's all over there right any questions any questions by the way this tutorial session is being recorded and if it turns out that engineering class students do not ask questions it's going to reflect badly okay so any questions come on she's taking a survey of all the faculties and uh the result will just confirm what everybody knows engineer students okay no now let's move on sir the the part three application application application ya okay word part three let's go part three there right now let's have a look at this particular matrix here uh this particular statement here this one here is a input a1 b1 is an input a2 b2 is output okay the relationship between them is a simple t now what if i have a whole string of boxes let's just draw more boxes okay now this one let's say i have a t1 matrix this one has a t2 matrix right the input here is related to this output via a t1 matrix but this output cannot be an input to the second system okay so this one will be related to another output a3 b3 via a t2 okay so the application of this is if i have a loads cascade of networks i find that this is a very powerful way of handling things right if there is a total of said n such boxes then all i need to do is take the product of all n of them and i can straightaway get hold of my input for whatever output regardless of the number of stages i need to  word  okay and for filter design you know those that uh you sometimes need a whole string of stages word  filter design not amplifier design okay so in fact this uh is uh kind of a there's a correspondence to the abc matrix in the because of abc matrix because of abc matrix word  something like abc matrix you word follow the transmission matrix right i know word is what textbooks like to use but uh it's a very clumsy of calling word  right different matrices will have different features that is what is remember that for question our sub-question b okay so let's look at part b now part b asks us to look at the system when it's reciprocal okay when does the system cease to be reciprocal come on i've already taught i've already asked you all during lecture uh plus plus any others active elements active elements some more byrex byrex okay most the majority of the systems will be reciprocal the only exceptions are onyl plus plus byrex active elements okay if you don't have these three the likelihood of it being reciprocal is very strong now for the s matrix it's very easy to spot whether the system is reciprocal or not just look for the off diagonal elements okay if the off diagonal elements are equal that's it the system is reciprocal t matrix however more work but t matrix you find that if you're to check whether your system is reciprocal you have to get hold of the determinant okay now why well here just go to the analysis to see why right that is your determinant you have all the elements already you are off here so that's perfect then right uh this okay right this is your thing that's question correct uh things that we cancel out so it becomes easier this one cancels with this so what we're left with is this it's s21 here it's s21 squared here so we'll get rid of s21 uh we're left with that okay now we're told that the system is reciprocal which means that the s12 will be equal to s1 so that means this will be one okay so this is your check if you have a s matrix it's simple just the check is just a visual check okay but if you're working on t matrix there's a little bit more work you have to form the determinant see if the determinant is one if it's given t then you can conclude that your system is reciprocal okay if it's not that means you have one of those three elements in there byrex active elements or plus plus okay any question no let's move on to question four this question three sets the background and answers for it now let's actually apply it to a circuit given in question four right question four you have this system the first matrix is sigma 'a' sorry second matrix is sigma what about sketching matrices we're told that uh this your first cascade second cascade and then finally you have to load okay these are all boxes but your load could be in this box here could be in the antenna right your antenna is radiating away this one this box here could be uh a filter network you want to make sure that only certain signals get sent all the other frequencies are filtered out this one here could be amplifier network okay you want to make sure you pump enough signal uh pump enough power for the antenna to radiate out right  so all these boxes are typical things that you need to put in for particular system to work right question is if here you have a load just put in the arrows if here you have a load such that your a just a minute a3 b3 if here you have a load such that b3 word three  word gamma l you'll be very interested to know what is my gamma in here the gamma in is uh b1 over a1 okay a typical situation will be like this this is your load you go through a series of cas uuh network over here you want to hook it up to a source you want to check that your load is not going to heavily affect the source operation okay so this is a typical problem i want to work out what gamma in is for gamma l after it has gone through a series of boxes right word in this case you find that uh your transmission matrix is not powerful than your sketching matrix okay alright uh your a1 b1 which you're interested in because that is where your source is you want to know what is happening to it let's say this can be transformed to t' this can be transformed t'' you want to know what is happening to word at the other port okay so that will give you this this one can then be related to your other port okay so that is what we have now let's give this a composite name this is a product here let's give it a composite symbol of t so that means what i have is a1 is equals to t11 a3 plus t2 b3 b1 okay that's what i'm going to have the right hand side here there are two symbols two parameters a3 and b3 however we learn that the load is somewhere else so the two of them are related in that case b3 is just straightforwardly this okay so if i want gam gamma a simple take this row divide by that row and straightaway i have the answer okay right now that's your answer in terms of the composite matrix t however we still got to get hold of t' and t'' okay so that's our next step get hold of t' and t'' right t will be t' times uh t'' what is t' from question two uh sorry question three from question three we've already established that uh okay t' ought to be that t'' simple it's exactly the same uh except for a change of symbols right now you can take the product of it uh straightforwardly by that but uh let's start making use of the approximations okay return the product you find that you are uh you have quite a whole long of unwieldy string of uh terms but instead of doing that let's look at the situation where skk here is small okay where sigma kk here is small 
Singapore	alright so last year what when we talk about hazards and you know there are two types of hazards right latent dependency hazards which is what you try to take care of by your data tagging internal body and the other type of hazards are job scheduling hazards and that's where we talk about collisions in the use of reservant table to prevent them just one point the ladies brought up to my attention when we talk about order table co-ording mechanisms to be very strict about it if you want to say that this after all the ording mechanism that you use produces an end state that is identical to the original sequence of instructions then we really need to have this as well in another word or rather make he make it uh comes up like that alright to be strict about it okay because the state of a system the state of a machine is determined by the contents of the internal registers alright at the end of this original set of instructions when mister ro would contain the result of that multiplication alright and that same result is word  into memory but it still contain in ro after that copy of registers alright for that year at the end of it ro will also should also contain the result of that multiplication alright so that's latent depend dependency has okay then we started on job scheduling hazards and we define a word alright to simplify matters we talk about a unifunction pipeline okay you can do likewise or multifunction pipelines too but it's more complicated you know initiation is just referring to the starting of a job in the pipeline and the job scheduling hazard essentially refers to a collision when more than one job try to use a particular stage of the pipeline and we need to use the reservation table to help us prevent collisions between jobs alright the latency in time interval between successive initiations that means between successive jobs a latency sequence is just a sequence of just the interval between jobs right and in if that sequence happen of intervals se uhm sequence repeats itself we call it a latency cycle okay alright and i showed you this example of a reservating table and we know that if you try to start a second job one time unit later you will get a collision right here at square two two right because job one is trying to use this stage job two is also trying to use the same stage okay job two is the blue mark job one is a red mark right so we know we need to obtain a set of forbidden latencies that means those tine intervals that we cannot start new jobs alright okay we start new jobs during those intervals at those intervals you will lead to collisions okay and it turns out that forbidden latencies can be easily obtained from the reservation table by taking the distance between marks in any row for this particular case the mark in the rows give us this set forbidden latencies alright one five six and eight okay you have marked it up one square apart here to there is five squares apart from here to here is six squares apart alright and from that to that there are eight squares apart okay so those are the forbidden latencies okay if you start a job at an interval equal to the spacing between any of those two marks then the utilisation of say stage two by the earlier job at the later time and by the later job at the earlier time you will clash what i'm trying to say is this supposing okay here is one two three four five so you start the first job and then you start the second job five times units later alright and at the time when the first job means stage two here that corresponds to a time when the second job meets stage two at this point alright because if you start your second job five times units later it may clash right okay this mark here corresponding to a second job is collision at this point actually isn't it you know you know in its reservation table okay so we know we can get the forbidden latencies right and to make control of the pipeline easier all these collision uhm time intervals the forbidden latencies can be put into what is called a collision vector and a collision vector is simply is single bit positions alright where the bit position equal to a one bit position k equals to a one if k is an element of your forbidden set okay that's a collision vector all other bit position will be a zero so for this specific example then what we are going to have for the collision vector is position one two three four five six seven eight that's the collision vector for this example alright position counting from right hand side starting at one okay so bit k is a one in k itself is in your forbidden latency and we make use of the shift register to decide when we can start a new job and you make use of it this way when we start a job in the pipeline you would load this vector into a shift register okay this collision vector goes into a shift register i mean start the job alright and then we start shifting one bit at a time for each clock cycle if you shift a one out then if that at that instant you cannot start a new job alright if you shift a zero out then you can start a new job okay now we said over here forbidden latencies are one five six eight so your first after you have started a new job you loaded this in the next clock cycle you will shift a one out that way you cannot start at the next clock cycle alright second clock cycle later you're shifting the zero out you can start a new job at the second clock cycle alright and that will not lead to a collision right because if you start one clock cycle later you see that collision at square two two if you start two cycles later there's no problem okay no clashes between the red and blue marks right so load this into a shift register and if you shift a one out then you cannot start a new job okay at that time instance right each cycle you shift one bit right okay now think of how the state of the pipeline will proceed from here right we've started one job without this okay so we loaded this collision vector one clock cycle later we shifted a one out we cannot start a new job second clock cycle after that you're shifting a zero you know you can start a new job fine and go ahead and start a new job alright if you do that then the new job is going to fit in it's going to start right here right two cycles later and the usage pattern will follow the same as the first one so it will go this way this way that's the second job now we need to know when can we start the third job okay when can we start the third job and so now we have job one and job two in the pipe job one job two okay this initial collision vector was used to prevent collision between this alright supposing after this case if you imagine you have another register okay we have more than one register for this collision vector after the new job we can load this same collision vector into the new register and then we start shifting out from the second register to decide when we start the third job right the situation is exactly the same as between job two and job one right okay between now we're talking about between job three and job two okay so by looking at the second register checking for what is shifted out we can prevent collisions between job three and two but but that's not all that we have to worry about isn't it we need to worry about clashes between job three and one as well alright if you like we can think of it this way we started one job then one time unit passes two time unit passes we started job two right so job two is the one that this collision vector can protect from colliding with job three okay so looking at the second copy of this vector we can prevent collisions between this third job now and the second job that means the blue and the green mark we can prevent clashes using this vector okay we still need to take care of clashes between the third job and whatever is left of the earlier jobs between job three and job one we still need to take care of that between the blue mark and the red mark right now we have not taken care of that yet alright sound complicated but we can just use one register to take care of everything okay because turns out that the convenient technique for handling all of these is to fine we know this which is this same collision vector will protect us from collision between this and this okay now we've started job two two time units later so we've shifted this out and we've shifted that one out so what is left for the first job is this pattern alright we need to or them or this one to this pattern okay so we'll or this and we'll end up with this this becomes the new collision vector and it will protect you against all collisions alright between your new job and all the previous jobs okay because this one prevents collision between three and two that one which is shifted from there prevents collision between the new job and the earlier jobs alright so this becomes the new collision vector for the whole pipeline for the whole system alright and you can proceed to do this for every single interval where you can start new jobs okay we say that this this collision vector represents the state of the pipeline alright and therefore we can obtain what is called a state diagram for the entire pipeline right that tells you exactly at any point in time when you can start another job okay no matter how many other jobs are still in the pipe so we need to get the state diagram alright don't this any more so the initial collision vector is this one two three four five six seven eight i do the working on another sheet alright then this one will give the proper state diagram we cannot start one time unit later we can start a new job two time units later so what is left from here is after two time units later you'll have zero zero one one zero one alright that is what is left from the earlier job for the new job for the second job which is started two time units later we we get this same pattern we or them we end up with this so this becomes the new state of the pipeline alright so we say this is initial alright your first one that comes in and then two time units later we started a new job the new state of the  word of the system becomes characterised by this collision vector alright we can also start a job three time units later right after the first job okay so that will give us a different table okay so that one will give us if you started three time units instead this is what is left again we have to or it  okay what is called the initial collision vector you get another new state okay so this one characterises this system if we started the second job three time units later instead of two so we have this after three time units right and you can proceed on okay second third fourth time interval then we end up with right you again you or them okay to give you the new state you proceed on like that you will end up with this one four units later alright so two three four five six you can start around seven units later if you start one seven units later and you or them you find that you get back this thing itself okay so seven units later you'd get back itself alright because after seven units all you have is a one in the least significant position okay so initial vector all with a one there give you exactly the same thing alright after seven you cannot start one eight units later you can start after nine units ten units eleven units and so on right okay so this also applies for nine and above right after the first clock so right now all we've taken care of is all possibilities after having started one job alright then we go to each of the other and do the same thing okay to find out what other new states so having done all cases with this we come to this so supposing it has first job two time units later it started second job when can we do the third job okay you can't do it one time unit later because you shift a one out you can do it two units later because they're shifting a zero out then you do the same thing right so in that case if you do that you're going to after two units from this state with their two jobs in the system then you start your third job alright we get this okay so that's the new state here where you start another job two units after this state alright again you can go two three four five six you can start one seven units later that will bring you back to this state right so after seven units again you're just left with one at the end okay you or that you have the initial collision vector you get back the same thing okay again you cannot start after eight you can start after nine and above nine and above there's nothing left all you have will be just this so again you have this and nine and above alright so you just proceed the same way for each state that you have not taken care of to fill up to complete this state diagram okay this is called a state diagram so let me just finish this up and one two three four units later you can start one more job right from this state we've taken care of this we've taken care of that okay so four units later and you or the results you're going to end up with this okay so after you you've done this or operation and get the new collision vector you have to check that whatever you have so far to see whether this new vector is in there or not okay whether you need to introduce it as a new state or it's a matter of going back to one of the existing states okay don't repeat the state you're going to confuse yourself alright 
Singapore	now i'll fill you on with uhm the addition reactions well you addition reactions are not typical reactions of aromatic compounds that or you have seen so uhm addition reactions are not the typical reactions of aromatic compounds uh but of the three five methods hetrocyclic compounds furan uhm thiophen and pyrrole i have pointed out to you that furan is of the lowest uh aromaticity it's the least aromatic of the three so you find that there are efficient reactions taking place in furan alright and this is because of its low aromatic character and uhm and indicates that furan tends to behave like a diene alright that's when it's not behaving like an aromatic compound alright this is furan uhm both of their electrons are opposed donated they are donated to the ring system in order that the compound possess six pie electrons alright required by aromatic sets word you note that if you mix these whole word the subsequent kenonical structures would have a positive charge on oxygen right which is not favourable for furan so because of that furan would rather not have alright the charge oxygen right it would tend to remain in its neutral form alright and in this way it will behave like a diene alright this is the diene component now there are many examples of furan behaving as a diene chemically uhm these are some of them can you see is it too light is it can you see from behind you can't ah would it help if i turn off the light right right so we have first of all the nitration of furan the nitration of furan uhm nitration is carried out using what is this reagent uhm ee lee it's the usual nitrating reagent for the hetrocyclic compound chek yu ahum tin wee this is the nitronium acetate nitronium acetate acetile nitrate alright quite close alright acetile nitrate and it is uhm nitrating agent for all these five hetrocycles because for what reason ming seng because it is weakly acidic alright you cannot afford to use uhm nitric acid word nitric acid and sulphuric acid for the nitration reactions so acetile nitrate is used because of its low acidity right so what do we have uhm now you find that for furan reaction with acetyl nitrate does not give them nitrofuran as expected instead the product of reaction is a two five adduct right having the structure so you see this is the nitronium ion that was originally added on alright and you find that there is a acetyl word that is attached onto the other terminal carbon which came from the acetate and ion alright there is a two five adduct that is formed this two five adduct is not very stable and on uh treatment and on heating or pyridine treatment with pyridine the acetyl word  is lost as acidic acid and this will regenerate nitrofuran right which is the product that one expects first now why is it that the reaction follows this rather odd course observed here now the mechanism of the reaction is shown well initially there would be an addition of the nitronium ion right like in the in this manner uh something that you are familiar with the charge alright would be delocalised the positive charge would be delocalised on this carbon this carbon and then on the oxygen which we know is of lowest stability because of the charge of oxygen now remember that when the nitronium ion goes and attack the carbon there is still the acetate that remains behind and the acetate and ion can act as a nucleophile alright so it will attack the positive centre on the carbon on a nucleus well this may not be sterically favourable alright this position may not be sterically favourable this one further away from the nitro would be more suitable and this is what happens the acetate then goes in into this position and you have your adduct formed alright in this way right so we have the nitronium ion and uhm this way in another words there are two alternative pathways which this nitronium which this cat-ion can go the first would be the usual elimination of h plus this will give you the substitution product alright uh the cost of react for thiophen and pyrrole this is the normal course of reaction alright the normal course but you find that there's an alternative process which is reaction with c-h-2 the nucleophile so the h does not get lost right this is the alternative alternative pathway now which of these paths or rather the choice of uhm which pathway would be followed is dependent upon the activation energies of each step depends on the relative activation energies of each step alright for this it would be the activation energy for the loss of proton alright and for this it would be the activation energy for the reaction with acetate now if the compound the resulting compound has got good aromatic character in it the activation energy for the protonation would also be low alright would be low if there is aromatic character well developed in the final product then the activation energy for loss of proton would be small alright but in the case of furan since aromatic character is poorly developed this is of low aromaticity the deprotonation energy would be higher than as compared to the deprotonation energy for the corresponding thiophen or pyrrole derivative alright so this pathway becomes an attractive alternative alright so that because of it the reaction is directed along this course rather than above but for the rest you find that if this is s alright or if it is n-h alright thiophen or pyrrole actually these two alternatives also exist that means it can go like that or by this way but you find that this pathway hardly takes place at all because the activation energy for loss of proton is very small and why is it small it's because aromatic character is well developed in the final product alright so it never even looks at this pathway it is directed along this direction in this direction so because of this ah for furan you do not have a straightforward substitution alright of h like n-o-2 but there is an addition by the acetate and ion to give rise to the two five adduct alright which is not stable so you do get back the product that uh one sets out to obtain the two nitrofuran by treatment of heat alright or uh by heat treatment or treatment with pyridine alright that will eliminate the acetate and give rise to the product okay right so that's for the nitration of furan now there could be other reagents used in place of acetyl nitrate uh reagents which contain a nitronium cat-ion and which are also weakly acidic one example is nitronium etrafluoroborate this alright nitronium tetrafluoroborate now when nitration is carried out using this particular reagent there is no adduct formed that means that it gives rise to a straightforward addition you get this immediately alright and you may wonder what happen to the bf4 minus why is it it doesn't add on to the positive centre to the ring the reason is that the bf4 minus is not a nucleophille alright it is not a nucleophile if you look at it carefully you will see that its valence is already saturated alright the boron atom cannot form an additional bond so it cannot it will not react with the current the positively charged carbon because its valence is already satisfied is completely satisfied alright so you find that when uh nitration is carried out using nitronium tetrafluoroborate you won't have this form alright you'll have the addition of the ni the nitronium cat-ion and then this will not take place the elimination of h will then occur and the nitrofuran is obtained alright so that is uh so must watch out you must watch out for the type of reagent that is used alright for the reaction now another example of an addition reaction of furan is the bromination is uh the bromination reaction now bromination uhm is usually not a very useful electrophilic substitution reaction because it tends to give rise to polyhalogenated compounds right the halogen enters at more than uh one position so it's uh unless you are looking for a multi-substituted product but if you want to have a monosubstituted product uhm in order for the reaction to be useful it must be conducted at low temperatures right low temperatures now this is an example the bromination of furan there's a bromonium electrophile the bromonium cat-ion which is the electrophile the reaction is carried out in the solvent methadol and at minus ten degrees centigrade now not uhm the products formed well not a-s a single product is not formed from this reaction alright you find that there are three products produced this is the expected product of electrophilic substitution alright now how did this come about by the following mechanism the same as the above alright there is a dis delocalisation of the positive charge there's methocide and ion which is the nucleophile comes from the solvent methanol alright so the methadol will produce the methocide and ion which will act as a nucleophile and attack the ring alright so you'll find that that is how the first product is uh formed and the second the third product that is shown uh it is produced by the displacement of b-r minus by c-h-3-o minus by the methocide and ion alright loss of p-r minus the halogens are good leaving groups so it is displaced and then you have it alright a diene methocine adduct alright so you find that uhm the hydrogen atoms here are quite resistant alright to displacement because they are not so uh they are not as good leave they are not word leaving groups as compared to bromine alright so uh these products are imitative of an addition reaction taking place in furan right now the last example of an addition reaction is that of a cycloaddition process and the name of this reaction is called is the dielsalder reaction now the diels-alder reaction refers to addition reactions of dienes alright you have a diene here now dienes will react with certain reagents uhm which are called dienophile actually the name is not very doesn't convey to you very much information because the dienophile is just a compound that likes a diene alright dienophile alright like hydrophilic right that uh p-h-i-l-e indicates it likes a diene so uhm a number various types of reagents can uhm act in this capacity as dienophile a common example a good example is maleic anhydride alright so when you have diene and maleic anhydride addition takes place to give rise to an adduct the product is just called an adduct or a diels-alder al a diels-alder adduct alright now if you look at it carefully you will see that this portion represents the original diene right this portion is the original diene addition has taking has taken place evolving the double bond right the double bond of maleic anhydride has disappeared alright so you find these are the new bonds that are created alright since addition occurs the two double bonds of diene cannot no long can no longer exist it is now reduced to one and this is the remaining double bond alright so can you see this is the original diene and this is maleic anhydride component alright with the double bond uhm saturated now furan has been noted to act like a diene it can react with maleic anhydride so you find that the same thing addition across the double bond of uh maleic anhydride produces an adduct now there are two confirmations of this adduct one an exo and the other one endo alright  exo is when the well the furan ring or what remains of it is orientated at a different plane from the maleic anhydride alright so these dash lines indicates that it's going down below the plane and the bold lines it is above the plane so that is endo alright the endo product is formed more rapidly it is a kinetic but it is not the most stable subsequent rearrangement will take place to give rise to the exo adduct note the orientation of these two wings alright now at the same direction this one is the thermodynamic product alright so this is an example have you do you remember examples of uh reactions under thermodynamic and kinetic control uuh one that i mention some time ago the sulfunation of kuinonine alright you find that that is also under kinetic and thermodynamic control alright so uhm the cycloaddition alright which is an indication that furan has diene-like character alright uh another thing that one could also add to the list of uhm properties you know like uh furan indicating its diene-like properties it's the electrophilic substitution of furan uh in particular the orientation of the incoming electrophile alright do you remember that part of it alright you had furan alright and you find that you have a substituent and i mention that uh for all the other hetrocycles where the electrophile enters will depend on what this x is whether it's electron donating or electron withdrawing right does that do you remember that but you find that in the case of furan it doesn't matter what x is the two x alright at the two position it can be electron donating or electron withdrawing but the electrophile is always directed to the other kerminal carbon alright position five alright and the reason why this is uh so well it is a reflection of its diene-like character alright i talk about the stabilisation of the carbonium ions and so forth alright supposing it goes here you find that there is limited stabilisation of the charge of the positive charge if it goes into this direction you find that it's more the localisation of charge alright so uh this is one point to take note of right can add can be added to the list alright of uhm uh chemical evidence of the low aromatic character of furan right now so having done with uh electrophilic substitution reactions and addition reactions we will now move on to nucleophilic reactions 
Singapore	right uhm before we start the usual things again the assessment forms please fill it in and uh pass it to your class reps who will give it to the g.o. okay my code instructor code 2180 64 now we are going to do letters of credit today but before we move on to that i want to just uhm summarise some points about the mortgages like our tutorial we had this is to uh enable some of you who were not quite finished the last time to word take note and then we can go on to letters of credit so this part won't be too much of a discussion hope you don't mind about that the mortgages tutorial question three was essentially a tutorial on land titles mortgages okay and before i go on to that actually there's a point on question two which i want to uh mention which i missed the last time and this is in relation to two b where the mortgage jobs lease have been terminated by his lessor okay we mention that his primary remedy would be a covenant i mean a suit upon the personal covenant uh under section eighteen of the clpa there is also provision for the mortgagee to go to court and apply for what is called a relief okay from from a relief in uh in other words asking the court to say look i've got interests this guy can move in but surely he's got to think about me could you ask him to give me some money at least you know that sort of thing so an application for relief section eighteen clpa okay so now question three the same sets of facts but uhm two a which say that as far as that is concerned uhm the pla has got uh provision for entry possession the difference between lpa entry and clpa entry is that under the lpa the mortgagee has got to give notice the one month notice before he moves in and his notice is given only if there is default okay if you remember under common law the mortgagee's right to enter is at any time even before the ink is dry on the deed but in this case in the lta your entry must be upon default since there is default here that point is academic that's three a three b i mention that uh once you look at the register the register is everything so if you see a mortgage there the lessor would have to take subject to the mortgagee's interest that's quite obvious because everything is on the register he would have noticed even if he didn't read it actually he's got constructive notice that there is a prior party so that he when he forfeits the lease of the lessee he takes that land back for himself that is he must take it subject to the mortgagee's interest okay and we've got that as a basic principle and it's supported of course by the lta the lta has got section sixty-two which says that when the lessor and the lessee's interests are merged in this case it has become uh merged in one person's name then what happen is that lessor that person who took the merged interest would have to pay off the mortgagee section sixty-two lta and furthermore we find that there is a section fifty-nine sub-section sub-section one of the lta again which states that a transferee cough  excuse me a transferee must uhm either pay off the mortgagee that means discharge him or perform the obligations of the mortgage so in this case section fifty-nine one is also useful for the mortgaging so you find that for under the lta the mortgager's position is much happier is not so long of course as he's registered okay regis the regis the register is everything therefore the mortgagee must register most cases you find they do once it's registered his rights are there in the lta section fifty-nine one question sixty-two okay three b three c is an oral contract which means it's an equitable mortgage under the lta you can have equitable mortgages it is recognised implicitly in section thirty-seven two which says that once you have contractual rights the lta does not invalidate those contractual rights it is also expressly accepted in a case decided by our former chief justice the case called bank of china uh bank of china versus official assignee nineteen eighty three case bank of china's case now we know generally that the remedies of the lta mortgagee are the same as he has been common law the section sixty-four lta says so section lt four uh section sixty-four basically says that the clpa and all your common law rights apply mutatis mutandis okay i explain because it's got something it's got nothing to do with the ninja turtles but nonetheless the root word is the same mutations so uh mu mutatis mutandis section sixty-four says that the clpa applies with appropriate changes in other words okay the appropriate changes meaning for example when the clpa talks about say a free-hold owner you just change it to registered proprietor terminology of the lta uh when the clpa says you've got a right for closure you look at the lta you find that the uh those rights mentioned in clpa are slightly modified in section seventy seven zero of the lta okay so mutatis mutandis so in this case then if the lta recogises an equitable mortgage then obviously what you have in common law the equitable mortgagee's rights those are more or less similar in the lta's system three d there is no mention anywhere at the and the lta that the rules about fixtures have been abolished so you can say that in this sense the lta is silent about fixtures therefore common law applies you could also actually look at section four definition of land section four lta defines land to include uhm structures affixed thereon for example and i think you could read that to mean that the law of fixtures mean the same okay that's three d and therefore the answer should be the same as in two d three e when we talk about relevant word of course we're talking about the lta the mortgage has not been registered under the lta which means it is not valid it is not recognised by the lta as a legal mortgage since it's not registered and since the register is everything this is not a valid legal legal mortgage nonetheless the lta does recognise an equitable mortgage as we said earlier that equitable mortgage cannot be registered but you can lodge a caveat in respect of that interest the purpose of lodging a caveat is basically to warn okay caveat means warning to warn the whole world at large that okay i don't have a registered interest but you better transact with my interest in mind i am an equitable mortgagee i may not have very strong rights but you must remember me when you talk to the registered proprietor so this is different from the roda roda basically as i said earlier on registration does not affect validity if you're already valid under the common law you remain valid even if you don't register if you originally were invalid registration does not make you valid so the roda does not affect validity but if you were a valid legal mortgage and you are number one in the queue you do want to continue being number one and in this case therefore you want to register because if you don't register you're going you're going to lose out you're going to lose your place in the queue and there's no point saying i've got a legal mortgage it is valid therefore i have a power of sale but you're number ten by the time you come to exercise the power of sale there's nothing to sell right so you want to be first in line you register  word being a legal mortgage ah doesn't it rank you ahead of the rest already yes no because if you don't register you don't have priorities so the fact that you are legal mortgage doesn't matter now because the roda changes your rights of priority section four basically and section fourteen of the roda okay section section four says you must register section fourteen says once you register you are preserving your priority consequently if you don't register you don't preserve your priority sir then when will it go when the equi the legal mor mortgage was prevailed when okay that was all the all the rules about legal over equitable and all that apply when there is no statutory amendment so for fixed charges and closing charges when they talk about ranking of course the legal prevails and the fixed prevails again they you talk about priority in other areas of property law which hasn't been changed the statute the ranking is there it's it's a general framework of law the ranking is given by common law but common common law can be prevailed can be overruled by statute and in land it has been overruled by the roda and by the lta okay so remember those rules i taught you earlier as a sort of background or a base on which now you are building new knowledge and that's the roda and the lta okay right now in this case registration uh non registration rather non registration would make the mortgage invalid unless it can be construed as an equitable mortgage in which case it's got the right of an equitable mortgagee i mean the the the mortgagee will have the right to the equitable mortgagee and that's another different story the whole idea of the lta is that once you've got registered land you don't have to look anywhere to search for title to search for who is the owner who has got a charge who's got a mortgage who's got a pledge whatever everything is on the register and that simple statement every the register is everything comes from privy council case actually and you could remember that as a quotable quote the register is everything exception of course is actual fraud when you have actual fraud then the person who's been defrauded can go to court and upset or erase the registration so to speak okay rectify the register okay that's two e and therefore two f is basically the same answer the unregistered mortgage it doesn't matter whether you are legal or equitable in this case once you're unregistered you do not have priority of course the registered legal mortgage will take priority one small little refinement to this point if the unregistered mortgage is an equitable mortgage you can't you can't register it at all under lta and since you can't register it there is no fight because here we've got a interest that is unregisterable versus an interest which is registerable and between these two then the the ah equitable mortgagee must lodge a caveat to preserve his priority if he doesn't lodge a caveat i would think he remains outside the register and therefore he has no right at all now in this case you would want to note the difference between the roda system and the lta remember i said that under the roda whether you are equitable or you're legal you are both registerable you are both registered registerable under the roda and therefore you've you have competing interests if one doesn't register in the lta system only legal mortgages can be registered and the equitable mortgage if you want to preserve your prio priority you have to caveat your interest okay and that sums up everything you need to know about lta questions sir when you lodge a caveat right does he rank uh ahead of the legal mortgage  well the caveat is a sort of notice to the world re remember if you remember your fixed charge lectures your first charge is a floating charge a second charge comes along and it's a fixed charge now the fixed charge prevails over the floating charge you jump the queue if you're a fixed charge but if you are a fixed charge with notice of a negative pledge cross up here then you take with notice and therefore you take subject to that floating charge interest right same thing here you've got an equitable mortgage caveated notice to all subsequent people that i've got an equitable mortgage then a legal legal mortgage comes along it's registered but it's registered subject to that interest because there is notice either actual or constructive okay right further questions okay no further questions we move on to our letters of credit and firts question you are now employed by this bank very progressive bank it wants to entertain the customers' wish if you can solve the problems that the requests ah raise so now we want to discuss these problems and see whether it can accede to the customers' requests okay so mr big your customer first request electronic communication facilities for credit can you accede to that request would you are there any problems mr big just wants communication facilites to apply for credits to notify his beneficiary to notify himself that his credit has been opened basically that can you do it yes no yes or no s2: yes yes who says no anyone thinks you won't request uh you won't accede to the request so you think yes all of you think yes are there no problems then what problems do you think there might be in this case any problem okay the technical problems we're not going to discuss them here but anyway this is not a problem because technology exists to allow the customer to communicate with this bank by electronic communications right so it exists the modem is quite cheap the telephone is quite cheap your fax machine all these things are on fact quite common so it's not the question of technology is there a legal problem is there a legal problem here what sort what sort of problem do you have here if you think there is a problem anyone 
Singapore	okay now in the previous many lectures and we concern ourselves with the the movement of solute in a single phase only we say how would the solute be transported from the bulk solution or bulk word to the interface or to the place where it ends we never said anything about what happen after that so we only concentrate ourselves with one single phase but mass transfer processes always involve some you know significant changes to the solute that you have so actually we have normally in in chemical word system multiphases and we can only consider a cup a two phases at a time how the solute move from one place to the other now for each phase involved there is what we have assumed the film theory and this film theory imply that the transport of molecule from the bulk into the uh to the interface or to the place where the two phases separate and we assume by the film theory that the major draught concentration draught or the major change in the concentration within the phase is confined to a single film and that's why we call it the film theory right and uh we relate this to our diffusivility and from there we relate to what we call a term call mass transfer coefficient now today we are going to continue with this and say how when this solute is then is brought to the interface separating the two phases what happen after that will the solute go into the second phase and if it goes into a second phase what happen that's one thing second thing is what happen at the interface okay now for this interface mass transfer it relates to as i said to many many different chemical engineering processes let's take for example the gas liquid system now here we are concerned with a particular solute in this gas and in the liquid mixture now we have a gas containing a solute which we want to remove using a solution in other words we want to the solute from the gas to go into the solution we have what we call absorption a-p okay a-b now here the ab and ad are two different thing and this actually is is subscripts of not subscript what the word called pre prefix of a english word stemmed from latin roots uh ab means by ad means two so here ab absorption is the solute from the gas is absorbed by the liquid by the liquid whereas in the third case where liquid-solid we have adsorption gas-solid too i forgot to put the one i should not put the liquid there i should put a uh fluid fluid solid system will be an adsorption adsorption means the solute is being taken onto the surface of the solids okay now this gas liquid if we have a liquid and we boil it up or even not boiling we if the uh if the gas phase that is in contact with the content less solute at equilibrium with the liquid then the solute in the liquid will then come out we transfer from the bulk uh liquid into the to the interphase and from interphase out into the gas phase now liquid liquid liquid liquid here we if we have to have a interface we must have immissible liquid in other words the liquid cannot mix each other so they become two phases and they are both in liquid state now here we have what we call in motion invisible liquid solid a movement now here we have relate to our processes call the extractive processes solvent extraction which i think i don't think you have done any experiment in that that will be in third year so solvent extraction so liquid solid we have absorption dissolution in other word the solid the solute in the solid will then dissolve in a liquid okay now very important concept here is mass transfer will only occur if that is a departure from equilibrium whether it is in a singlephase or cross-phases okay now in a gas phase or in a vapour phase we can describe our composition in terms of y-a which is the the uh ratio of the partial pressure of a divided by the total pressure that is given by dalton dalton's law and he says summation of this partial pressure is equal to total pressure that's what we can find the composition in that way and this will be molar composition and dalton russ which rasult says that it is a simple relationship to the solute concentration in the other word in a liquid phase so in p-a partial pressure is equal to y-a-p over x-a now this is ideal system now non-ideal system of course we have i think in term of dynamics you already study about this activities you cannot use x-a you must use activities and activities of course related to the activity coefficient and so on now henry's law henry's law is strictly is a very special case is strictly apply to only dilute solution or to solution which contains very sparingly soluble solute so so that the partial pressure is directly proportional to the concentration of the solute now this the second two relationship with dalton raoult's and henry's law describes the equilibrium relationship between the solute in a liquid and a solid in a gas phase okay now this is for the gas liquid now for the liquid liquid i just put the example for the gas liquid here for the liquid liquid same thing happens except that x-a and y-a are now referring to the two liquid phases okay and this is what we call liquid liquid equilibrium relationship but they are not governed by the same law now the solid liquid the solid fluid now you have heard about adsorption you have heard about adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm is a equilibrium relating the solute in a fluid and a solute absorbed onto the solid okay so that is the demure you have done that haven't you in your thermodynamics no demure fixed law so those are the fluid solid equilibrium don't be so stern don't worry about word  now that part when you translate you have to remove this they look they look so tense normally they are not like that your influence normally they were laughing and smiling okay anyway so now we've come back to this the relationship now you must have wonder why did i talk about equilibrium now if you have a transfer from one place to another definitely there must be some relationship between the two phases and since you have a interface that equilibrium relationship most probably i say first most probably occur at the interface now through research and all it has establish that no matter what happen at interface at interface the composition of one phase is invariably in equilibrium with the second phase at the interface now there's some work long time ago regarding this phenomena and there's one research worker claim that there's certain departure he call it the kinetic molecular departure but then the departure is so small that for all purpose and intention we say that it is at equilibrium and this make life very easy for design engineers okay now with that let's look at the composition diagram for the different model now we join the liquid the the film theory for one single phase and since now we have two phases we have two film so we call this as two film model and this is first proposed by lewis and whitman each film is describe by the film theory regarding the transport of the solute from the bulk to the interface this is the word separating the two phases and the other one the phase two is sort of described by similar ways and this is our concentration profile now here we find that the diagram there depicts the movement of a from the gas phase to the liquid phase and c-a-i p-a-i are the composition relating to the two phases at the interface and word  that they are related through the equilibrium relationship no matter whether it's liquid liquid system solid fluid system or gas liquid system okay each one has its own type of equilibrium relationship now this conceptually p-a-i is not exactly sitting on the interface okay it's a little bit removed from interface it is the partial pressure of a at the interface just floating above the interface and the concentration c-a-i is just immediately in the liquid phase at the boundary condition at the boundary itself and together they maintain that relationship so the the uh rate of transfer from the bulk of the of phase one to the interface is then described by this concentration jug within the film itself and it moves into the liquid phase after it has gone into the liquid phase or into the phase two now if phase two is liquid a when get from the gas into the liquid phase has to become a liquid state word  now that becomes that join into the a in the liquid phase or in the phase two and then you move into the bulk solution now if the gas phase and the liquid phase are in motion and in constant motion and if p-a-g and c-a-l are constant in other word it is a dynamic system if they are constant then there will be a steady state whereby the rate of movement in the gas phase will then be equal to the rate of movement in the liquid phase now which is not a dynamic system if it is just a batch system let's say you bubble gas into a liquid station and uh liquid which is stirred but then the liquid is not moving nor out of the system itself then the bulk concentration of the gas will decrease because more and more being absorbed into the liquid and then the liquid concentration through this absorption will then increases and there will come a time when the bulk solution will then appear together at the equilibrium concentration and the gas phase we were saying decrease to a concentration and this will then be at equilibrium in other words the whole system is at equilibrium there is no net transfer that is only for a batch system so a batch system that movement is transient state at steady state it is at equilibrium okay the gas concentration the solid concentration the gas phase because now there's no movement the bulk and interface and the film will be the same so that concentration will then be at equilibrium with the liquid concentration now in chemical engineering processes we are dealing mostly with steady state phenomena so this particular case illustrated here is of imp of importance so here now we say n-a-z that's the amount of a transfer in phase one is related to k-g times p-a-g minus p-a-i now this k-g as we said it is a mass transfer coefficient now the unit n-a will depends on how you define k-g alright if you define k-g based on the unit per square area then n-a will be word per second per metre square in s-i unit okay p-a of course it is impartial pressure so your k-a must convert that partial pressure into the word of places right so here your units are very important now for phase two similarly we have k-l c-a-i minus c-a-l now k-l is the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase now sometime we use the word film on top of it partly to identify that this relates to a special phase itself to phase one to phase two so usually we says film mass transfer coefficient later on you know why we have to use the word film to differentiate from what we call the overall mass transfer coefficient  now this is no different from your heat transfer lecture given by dr neo right we have our individual film transfer coefficient and later on we have our overall film transfer coefficent now this diagram here illustrate the equilibrium relationship between the two phases relating to this particular solute a and this eq the equilibrium curve this arbitrary it can be described by a given equilibrium relationship if it is described by henry's law then that is not a word relationship it is a linear relationship okay now here we can see that at the interface the composition is represented on the equilibrium curve and if you look at this the slope of this line joining the p-a-g and c-a-l that particular point in other word it describe the bulk concentration to the interface composition that slope is given by minus k-l over k-g it's a ratio of the two mass transfer coefficient now this are not dimensionless ah the slope is not dimensionless because k-l and k-g has different dimension depending on how you what is the concentration uh composition you are using here we are using partial pressure and molar concentration now if you change both of this relationship to molar composition then it is dimensionless otherwise it is not okay 
Singapore	you can sit here if you want i can't see that where okay so you had more time to prepare yah what do you think are the what do you were are the problems with section five which have either been solved or not solved can we just go through a list of them david i think there's still the difficulty of  word that issue if you okay use the word 's evidence to quote okay so so take so try to think of it as a kind of a a structure okay i mean number one you must know the cases prior to the amendment what were the problems with this thing prior to the amendment okay and then has each one of these problems been solved by the  word amendment if so how if it hasn't why or has it created new problems i mean i mean that's the basic structure which which i want you to look at okay you you say it hasn't solved the framing of the issue of question why  cough  because there's there's been no direction made out as to uhm how you telephone rings how you frame the issue hello yah hi debbie nope no why on what how about yourself not coming uh not coming is it that's what announcement do you want okay i'll ask her you don't want them is it michael is doing a lecture uhm ya i think okay don't don't don't too much it's semi-terrorism we'll tell michael okay i'll tell him whether you need them but uh ya it's okay bye okay framing of word  uhm are you still reading that one no i just i need the three act the acting one uhm you should read the other one lah uhm which i'm sure your have read uhm okay yes david go on because uh compared to the prior to the amendment there's an an uh new  word and a and amendment uhm there's there's no additional instruction laid down as to how you should approach and frame the issue okay so you you're starting out by assuming that framing the issue of question is a problem uh uhm i assume yes so will you think that there're different levels of framing the issue at certain levels if you frame the issue it could possibly question of issue  word other levels no but what do you think uh su ann will you have problem not very sure uhm i think it depends on which approach you want to uh you want to take if you set the actions approach which seems to be the favourite approach nowadays then you don't have to uhm you see that's one way of actually without looking at the word amendments trying to solve the problem within the cases itself that that's one way of seeing well the problem only exists under lon and dalton's approach if you look at word 's way of framing or frame the issue of question then the problem won't exist anything and and how would you do it yah for acting's approach got to oh you know what  word all is ah okay that that could be a problem or okay that that see that's a problem which will not exist for uh would never have existed under word 's approach but now exists under atkins' approach and the problem is even if you were to say that okay that that's the first first difficulty right framing of issue of question let's go on to the next one we'll sort of follow from what you said earlier on number one atkins if you follow atkins approach in framing the issue of question i want you to know the meaning of multicarlaw that has not been settled of course unless the legislative said we leave it to the cases to decide i mean basically it's the common law that word  that gives us law not really satisfactory but but you know there's been an entire range of dicta right some cases say well mercantile law's not the same as law merchant then you've got word word   word and the and the earlier ones i mean word  the whole range of definitions from mercantile law plus you see under lord dalton's approach this would not have been a problem at all because the law there would have meant english law okay but if you take the words with respect to those matters as having qualified the law with strictly to with strictly to mercantile law then again the definition of mercantile law becomes important you see which again is non-settlement yah but the law any problem siew hwa the law with respect to those matters was it necessary any anything it solves uhm the word law itself be that the law the applicable law see you covered the word you covered the definition what about the applicable law has that been settled was it a problem as the amendment have it's still a problem  cough why has it has it to do with the section you're talking about written law no no no not that section the applicable law uhm the law which comes in via section five well it seems that i think the amendments is trying to qualify that the law the law can be applied in singapore okay so again you have two diff conflicting approaches under you have to explain the problem lord dalton's approach the whole law of english the whole of english sort of come in atkins' approach only mercantile law does come in so you've got two different approaches now again has that been settled by the word  amendment so divided the words with respect to this matter you see for each one of them you start out by saying okay number one there were two different approaches was there a problem i mean was it was it a conflict or was it more of a a word you know was there a conflict if there's a conflict it's word  if there's no conflict then word  amendments really word  do you uh you don't have to say everything was a problem you may say that i think although that telephone rings  hello hello yep okay alright thanks bye you see just remember if it's not a conflict at all then you don't have to to go on and really try to see whether it solve the problem like like for example let me take a more fundamental point do you think that the two approaches are in conflict with one another yes do you think the approaches are conflicting enough think carefully i mean if you say that they are conflicting approaches fine uhm bear in mind except lord atkins says he does not disagree with lord dalton do you think they are conflicting approaches you may argue they are conflicting in the sense that they lead to totally different results or someone may argue that well they're not really conflicting they are the same it's just that the starting point of the entire thing is different which actually lead to different results but the approaches are itself not conflicting but i don't i don't see how the approaches are the same okay it's the same issue of question okay the law can be applied okay qualification correct but the law we applied is different only because when you frame the issue of question you frame the issue but or question by looking at the mercan at at the law so if the law is mercantile law there'll be a issue of question restrict to mercantile law which means the law coming in would be mercantile law it has to be but the issue in the statute of the question is not mercantile law no issue of question with respect to mercantile law it won't come in do you follow the starting point actually word  you will say that that could mean that the approach is the same or one could equally argue word they're completely different oh right 'cos it leads to completely different results as in entire different way because that is not the way lord dalton will frame the issue of question law you know lord atkins frames it in a very different way i mean you can come to completely different results but you you don't have to sort of take what the book says is correct all the time okay okay uhm the law with respect to those matters what used to come in and word the amendments up david you said yah i think uhm the amendment was trying was trying to qualify the law applicable in singapore because he added in 'with respect to those matters' so i would think they would be trying to qualify uh the law to maybe laws relating to banking principles and etcetera or you can say you think that there was a  word and that this makes it clear that not all law comes in but only mercantile law comes in yah at this stage i mean you can compare this with the object and purpose of section five and and again you got a whole string of  word law you think the amendment makes it more consistent with our object and purpose of section five it it qualifies the law to be applied to that restricted to mercantile law only okay fine any other problem on this section ah in in the old uh in the amend pre-amendment cases don't don't look at the word okay look at the cases first ask yourself okay what were all the problems that exist okay you've covered the issue of question okay you covered the law applicable we've covered the problems of definition of mercantile law we've covered the question of whether the two approaches are different what other problems you think you're interested  word  okay word okay before we talk  word can we talk about the general applicability now you remember that was never a problem until word  'cos it's it's something they never really have to consider  word  no in word you find that all three courts don't want the money lent back to the client the more important dictas the is to be shift one to the high court i think it's uhm word very good dictum at the last paragraph uh that the moneylender side are not capable of this thing their sections are so interdependent provides for machinery and everything else now look at the dicta they'll give the case okay can you take the last paragraph word  activities okay you have the case with you su ann you think so good i'm sure you'll find it the last para okay no it's it's a very im important point the high court word activity you didn't have it do you have it the high court word will shakes up can't be that difficult to find  word  yah okay read read the last paragraph okay uhm i'll like the defence of the real act hese acts in question have no white imperial concern or word  they are very special municipal ways of legislating the region creating creating procedure and machinery and setting up restrictions and sanctions which are quite impossible to christian ideas okay let's let's just stop there do you think that they're very special municipal ways of provision creating procedure and machinery setting up restrictions and sections penalty uh ah impossible application okay now ask yourself carefully is this is he talking generally about ah acts suitable or not suitable or is he saying that if an act creates for procedure and machinery and sets up restrictions and sanctions restrictions can be probably licensing and sanctions will be penalty are his remarks directed at a general applicability test or he's talking about a specific word  moneylender's act no not so much moneylender's act is he talking about an act which creates restrictions sanctions procedure and machinery is he talking about that  do you know what i mean it's interesting because you you take you see okay then you go to look at lord atkin lord okay because he to create this exception uhm word relied on the word perfect law and its application correct and and that has been discredited so that is all now lord atkin does the same thing right lord atkin says the same thing he says oh you know there's an implied exception correct not found there but but hid it's an implied word and this the thing that soon and pang criticise right they they say that oh section five it's not possible for section five to have this implied exception not found within the words of the section itself they criticise that part okay so the next question we went on to uh the section five three a allow for this suitability test and to that the answer was no because five three a says modify and adapt whatever has already come in but the suitability test applies at the stage where it determines whether not something comes in so that can't be the one so that that they've argued it as a problem right and think about it carefully if what um word activity did what lord atkin wa talking about in fact atkin's remark was somewhat similar to her i'm not a general suitability test but they're only talking about acts which create licensing you know concerned with licensing penalties registration is that exception provided in word  ya it is you see do you do you see again it it depends on how you read the cases if you say well here they were not i mean they were not so specific as to talk about registration sanctions and and procedure and everything they're talking about suitability test okay and lord atkin talks about the implied suitability test not found within the words of section five so that was the problem where did he find the legislative basis for it then you ask yourself that's the nineteen seventy nine amendment solved then give you the problem now it doesn't really solve that right because soon and pang say modify that and that cannot mean suitability but if you start out by saying wer um the words uhm which word  activity gave and lord atkin says i'm not a general suitability test but i'll confine to act s which create procedure and machinery licensing and penalty that has been provided for under this amendment so that problem has been solved as well and there's no need and so the bulk argument as well there's no need for a general applicability test well i mean that that's their basic premise they say no you don't have to have a general applicability test then that is solved but then that depends on how you read it if you read this as a wide applicability test then of course you'll have problems later on that's all 
Singapore	good morning i hope you don't mind my starting now but we have quite a lot of materials to get through today alright our last lecture on vicarious liability so let's continue there now last week yah i was starting to go through some of the rules by  word when an act of an employee is done within the force of employment as i said the phrase force of employment is used rather likely used in the phrase you take care and a lot of things word  yah as far as i carry the liability of return this phrase indicates when policy would tend to make an employer liable to the act of an employee right so first we have to define what the employee's duties are that's logically first step in the analysis the next thing is to try to find the connection between what the employee has done and tort to his people complain of and the employer because at the end of the day we want to make the employer liable right now after talking a little bit about connection i went into some situation because as i say it is the the convention is divide the acts of employees into two basic types careless acts by the employee in other words where the tort arises from a careless act of the employee and deliberate act when the tort was committed deliberately alright because then show differentiation in these two categories is necessary because it much easier to say that the employer is liable where the tort was merely committed carelessly where the tort was committed deliberately by the employee then the employer has far better chance of escaping liability right that's the conventional classification and i've already talked about careless acts by the employee right now i'm introducing another category category which i think is useful for our analysis because really there are acts which fall in between the class careless act by the employee leading to the tort and when we talk about careless act here we're talking about careless act within the normal duties of the employee right and then there are deliberate tort deliberate tort committed by the employee for which the employer doesn't tend to be liable there is what i call intermediate position and the terminology is my own this intermediate position has elements of both right where we have intermediate position like this we're already talking about an employee who has deliberately done what he's not supposed to do as far as his employer's concerned he departed from his usual duties deliberately but the tort arises out of his carelessness right so different from deliberate tort by the employee because the employee did not actually intend to cause harm right it's different from deliberate tort which we're going to discuss in a while it's deliberate from the pure careless tort which i was discussing earlier because here the employee isn't so much acting within his normal duty he has done something that's a little bit different from what the employee sorry what the employer really intended him to do right this intermediate position it doesn't fall nicely into either classification and so i think we can usefully discuss it separately now i word there were blank looks last week when i'm was making that point sorry last tuesday so let's just take an example of what i consider to be intermediate position right a case which should be familiar to you right now from our lectures on richard on sat richard statutory duty ici chapel right you remember in that case word was supposed to follow certain procedures they were supposed to follow certain procedures when setting off explosives or sorry when testing connection and things like that they decided not to follow these procedures yah and there was an explosion an injury was sustained now the injury was not deliberately caused right nobody actually set out to hurt anybody but there was a deliberate departure on the part of the employees from what they were supposed to do they were supposed to test the connection in a certain way they decided not to do it they decided to do it in a way which they were told not to do it right so this is an illustration of what i call the intermediate position the harm is not caused deliberately but it flows because the employee has deliberately departed from what should be his proper duty another example of that would be word  also a breach of statutory duty word  look that up yourself these cases i think you will recall resulted in the employee sorry in the employer not being vicariously liable right there was vicarious the employer's word vicarious liability there which should be indicate to you that this really can be treated differently from the pure careless act it's very difficult for the employer to escape vicarious liability for a pure careless act occurring as a result of the employee performing his duties properly if carelessly but in this intermediate position it is slightly easier for the employer to escape vicarious liability examples of where the another example of where the employer escapes vicarious liability would be for instance the case of storey and ashton right this is the case that would be in most of the case books so i'll leave you to look it up yourself except that i'd like you to note that here it involves someone who has finished his duties he had completed his duties in other words and what he did was he took a ride yah he took a ride after that to visit someone it was a personal visit using his employee's carriage while on the way for this personal visit he got into an accident someone was injured so was the employer vicariously liable for his carelessness here the answer was no the employee's duties had ended right the court used the phrase that ah that employee had gone on a frolic of his own this word word sample phrases that i'm confident will end up in your vocabulary before very long just like phrases like floodgates of liability and very often been misused but that really is a phrase which gets used from time to time when we're talking about the employee's duties yah the stage he has departed from his duties in a manner sufficient to spare the employer liable we often use the phrase the employee went on a frolic of his own that indicates the connection with the employment it's not sufficient to found vicarious liability right as i said the test in these kinds of situation would be whether or not tortious conduct the accident while travelling with your friend yah is reasonably incidental to the performance of your duties in storey and ashton it's pretty clear that it wasn't reasonably incidental because the employee had finished doing what he was supposed to do he had finished making all deliveries so there was an insufficient connection there but no not all departures from duties will amount to a frolic an example of a case where it wasn't frolic it's whatman and pearson which was mentioned earlier this is a case where an employee was told not to go home for lunch uh and leave some word unattended the employee did so the horses ran ran wild caused some injury and the employer was held vicariously liable for those injuries even though he word  from the deliberate departure by the employee from what he was told to do that what i call the intermediate position as i said it lies between deliberate acts and careless acts careless acts very hard for the employer to escape vicarious liability deliberate acts more easy for the employer to escape vicarious liability an example of a deliberate tort by the employee yah for which the employer was not held liable would be a local case that went up to the privy council keppel bus company and sa'ad bin ahmad this is an this is a case from singapore i i don't think many of you are old enough to remember there was a keppel bus company but this case really is a stuff which new paper headlines are made conductor attacks passenger that's what happened the conductor was one of those that fortunately we don't have anymore yah uhm he was he was abusing a passenger the plaintiff like a hero went up and tried to tick the conductor off and got a ticket punched in his eye now this case is really a very good advertisement for omo uhm the plaintiff lost his eye as a result of this assault and he sued the employer right as i said there would have been no point in this case trying to sue the employer this is a mere bus conductor who would have been earning two three hundred dollars a month yah how's he going to make good the loss of the eye answer he can't so the plaintiff tried suing the employer keppel bus company and what was decided in that case answer the employee's conduct was deliberate wrongdoing by the employee it was deliberate wrongdoing so the employer should not be vicariously liable now another example of a situation where deliberate conduct spares the employer vicarious liability deliberate tort yah would spare the employer vicarious liability it's a fairly similar case warren and henley this time in england a garage station attendant who gets a strange idea in his head and starts accusing a passenger of non-payment sorry uh a customer of not paying his bill customer gets upset says some things to the to the attendant attendant flies into a rage and hits the pa the customer now again the court said the employer was not liable because this was an assault it was pure vengeance on the part of the employee it's not connected with employment it's deliberate act and therefore the deliberateness of the assault severed the connection with his employment even though he did it during office hours yah even though he did it because he was in that position because he was employed by the by the employer there was still not sufficient con uh connection the deliberateness severed the connection that's necessary to make the employer liable for the tort it would be nice if we could say the uh the employer was never liable for deliberate act but i'm afraid life is not so simple because there are deliberate acts where employers still are liable for the torts right one example is poland and john parr this is a case again on assault where the employee saw the plaintiff and thought the plaintiff was trying to steal the employer's goodies from all the carriage so the employee gave the plaintiff a good hard knock the plaintiff fell down under the wheels of the carriage and had his arm broken right uhm in that case however the court said the employer was vicariously liable so even though it was a deliberate assault on the part of the employee the employer was still vicariously liable in other words deliberate conduct doesn't always severed the connection between the tort and the employer there may be vicarious liability so when will there be vicarious liability a deliberate conduct and when will the employer escape i think the answer lies in looking at the nature of the conduct and whether or not there is benefit to the employer from that conduct right now when we talk about conduct again i would avoid defining conduct too narrowly we're not talking about whether or not the employer benefited from the blow being struck by the employee in poland and paar right we're talking about whether the employee thought he was something for the benefit of the employer in other words guarding the goods right compare that for instance the keppel bus company and sa'ad bin ahmad and warren and henley right  those are situations where the conduct clearly didn't benefit the employer the employee was simply doing it for revenge for his own purposes he wasn't trying to benefit the employer now in the privy council in keppel bus and sa'ad bin ahmad the court mentioned for instance that the plaintiff might have recovered from the employee employer the employer might have been vicariously liable if the bus conductor's conduct at that time had been connected with his duties as bus conductor so if for instance the bus conductor had been trying to maintain order on an unruly bus passengers were screaming and shouting he was trying to push people back into the seat right and he committed an assault in the course of trying to do that then that would be related enough to his duties that the employer would have been vicariously liable there is then potentially a connection a connection if a connection can be made between what the employee is doing and the benefit of the employer then the employer may still be vicariously liable even though the tort has been committed deliberately but when you have clear situations like keppel bus company and sa'ad bin ahmad and warren and henley when assault by the employee were absolute were purely personal there was no thinking on the part of the employee that i'm doing this for the good of my employer then the employer would escape vicarious liability for the deliberate tort of the employee right simple enough isn't it 
Singapore	okay let's get started uhm i'm going to give you a handout it's uh there's uh those are the things you're going to do today i don't know how you're feeling today not too good for me i've got a sore finger uh okay let's get started we're going to talk about uh working with parents today and uh this going to be very important because when you go to the primary schools you'll be working a lot with parents a lot more than when you are in secondary school alright so we're going to look at different aspects of uh parent-teacher relationship and why is it important to establish good relationship with parents okay do you think you could get settled down and yah okay so uh to start off we want to talk about the different types of uh school-home relationships uhm i re i think most of us are from different types of schools uhm perhaps government schools and others the uh the government-aided school so there are actually different types of relationships that these schools have with the family or with parents uh only like to suggest that the very first type of school is what 'keep out' you know this this school will probably say hey you know we we run the business we know all about education so you just do your parenting at home and leave us alone alright keep out so i i think you might have seen signs around in schools that say 'parents must not enter the school premises unless the the alright and there are some other schools called usual school and these are the school that say 'okay if you wanna come in you are welcome but if you want if you don't want to come to school that's alright too i mean we've called upon you and you don't want to come that's fine if you want to come that's fine too usual type and then of course there are the p-t-a school parent-teacher association uhm i think a number of schools in singapore have taken this kind of approach now but mainly i think the pity is that most of them  word to fund raising you know they are referring to curtains ah wanna donate money to build the swimming pool and things like that that's about it alright and of course there are the true community schools where uh surely you read the report about the new raffles girls' school where they're going to have uh open up the school premises for computer classes word  in the evening alright where they're going to welcome parents in to uhm conduct courses for the students in there okay that's a community school so when you go to school the next time you're going to see for yourself what what what kind of school do you think your school falls under what category does it fall under okay so that's that's just to start you off with types of home-school relationship uhm let's see why is it important to establish good parent-teacher relationship interaction you know when the parents come to school uhm they they actually see how the school operates especially the primary school they like to but they keep them out isn't it in primary one they are not allowed to go in but they they still peep through the windows and see what's happening so they can see the learning environment and they can know what's the school programs are they they they can look at the notice board and see uh what sort of  word programs there are what sort of e-c-a activities there are alright what sort of medium programs and all okay so they can actually see uh how teachers teach sometimes or maybe in talking to the teachers they can know what sort of teachers there are in school uh what sort of approaches they use and things like that and very importantly the third point sometimes you may have set some kind of work for students especially weaker ones and you would like them to be supervised by their stu uh by their parents at home so that's when you need parents to supervise and make sure that their children have done the appropriate homework the the assigned homework alright and sometimes the parents will ask you in school uh when they talk with the teachers in in the process of talking with the teachers they can learn something about how important the parental role is just a guidance and supervision not only in academic areas but in the others in social emotional development word right and of course parents can make some significant significant contributions to the school ah not sure whether you re have read articles about uh schools like st nicholas have you read anything about the art where they actually ask parents to come in to talk on certain programs is anybody familiar with that kind of uh interaction that st nicholas school has do you know what what they do  word  yah they did  word   word  singapore teach uh to teach courses to teach courses i see now what sort of courses can you story-telling ah okay story-telling oh parents are involved with reading program they actually break the children into small groups and parents come in to read to the kids or they help out in help help out in library work and things like that okay and i think they do something about gardening too right so that's an avenue you can tap parents' expertise okay so we say that parents need teachers because parents can see all these things happening but teachers also need parents because they can use parents to be a member of the teaching team it means uh whatever aspect in school the parents can go back and supervise their children alright i'm not sure whether you're familiar with this term called contracting sometimes when the kids come to see you and this kid uh not very well-disciplined so you wanna have a contract some kind of a time-table alright to say that hey watch less of tv and spend that two hours doing maths something like that you know when you see the parents and you may wanna give that contract with the time-table that kind of thing will you please supervise your child every night for two hours alright so the parents can be a member of the teaching team and then they can provide supportive and extend word experiences meaning if they can actually word their children out in perhaps assessment work you know other word activities at home what sort of uh educational toys they can buy for their children okay and then by doing that you you hope to see a snowball effect other parents see that hey uh these parents are actually  word quite involvement with their children's work maybe we should do likewise or or maybe we should get other parents together and and and come together to school and uh and help out in the school management or other school committee alright so i hope you can see uh the importance of p-t interaction from there but very often more often than not you hear about complaints about parents right later on we will talk about problem parents okay and how to handle them okay so after stating the importance of uh p-t interaction what are the ways we can ensure that this kind of interaction work out i'm not sure whether you might have some ideas i'm sure you can think of meet the parents right did your parents ever go to your school when you were in school how many of you how many of your parents did none of you laughs  i think they've this thing called meet the parents and they've lots of concerts where they invite parents right uh i don't know how many of your parents went to school okay this some of the ways to establish good relationship with the to make the school as a welcoming place uh well as word says inviting school lah you know facilitating this inviting environment are there things around parents can walk in and see that they know that they are welcomed alright they'll talk about i know the oversea they talk about parents' room they even have special bulletin boards for parents you know when they can hold up some information for parents i'm not sure whether this is done in singapore i don't think any school has a parent room i'm not sure if the new a-c-s has a parent room i doubt it anyway the idea is to welcome parents coming in they could for school assembly you may think that these are very western ideas but uh there'll be some there may be some of them which you can modify and and think about in the west they talk about morning coffee then uhm you know i think this is done in singapore where parents help out in outings organising outings and taking the children out very much so word because they they need adults around to supervise the children maybe one adult to five children  word small ones you know so i think parents uh can be asked to fork out there okay so these are some of the ways and some very specific ways would be uh written communication where there are class bulletins there there are newsletters especially for parents got to bring the facts there now i was in the hospital last time laughs  yah okay so there are there are special newsletters for parents involve parents in word in school and future events and uh some achievements of students there and things like that lah okay uh as far i know word a-c-s has one report express not sure about other schools have you come across any i think heng boys has one too primary school i because my nephew is from that school i think they have one word  do you know of any other primary schools that give letters to parents yeh cedar 'a' yeh  word  oh it's alright there are one of those it's a primary school or second primary school is it oh that's good ya so the idea is that if there is a this channel of communication with parents letting the parents know about what's happened in school alright and uh school report annual report word not sure every student gets it but in some schools they do school magazines you know alright and besides these uh avenues of written communication there are al also a lot of informal discussions that can be carried out but the idea is that the teachers must not feel threatened you know sometimes when parents come in teachers can feel a bit threatened what do you want why did what do they complain you know and what what do you really want from me uh i i at the other side of the coin some parents also feel that whenever teachers call about it must be that little tommy is misbehaving alright uh so you have to establish this kind of understanding that uh we don't call upon you just because there's some problem right so that's why these uh morning coffees and uh uh uh at evening just to meet the parents not just to talk about results you know very often at meet-the-parents sessions you you hand in your report book uh and very often you give your report only when the parent come comes along isn't it and we want to make sure that those who fail are the parents of those student who fail must turn up alright no but i think the the kind of word  uh  word perpetuate the kind of thinking in parents okay so sometimes you get uh whole conferences where parents  word i'm saying that certain schools that arrange for talks and sessions like uh parenting style and how to be an assertive parent how to bring up your child gracefully whatever is  there are such talks around word  and then of course your informal contact sometimes you will need to interview the parents you're talking about counselling contexts now uh where you want to find out a lot more about how the children are a child is like he's at home so you may want to set up parental interview okay and uh working with parents in a small groups like maybe on a specific for specific problem maybe there are some kids with uh problem with the inthing now is obesity ya terrible  word you're a member of the fattish club ya they should say something like a health club or trimming club ya maybe their children with that kind of problems alright and and so you might want to get them to generate and discuss how to help them help their child with this problem alright uhm for specific interest groups and just to reach out to the working parents you may want to think about evening informal evenings uh it's not terribly good to have uhm meeting with parents on saturday morning i mean not everybody well we have to work on saturday morning some parents have to work on saturday mornings too maybe a friday evening or something like that and a very important tool is really home visitation we're talking about home visitation and the counselling technique we're going to link it with what you've done last week counselling uh what do you do when you go when you have to go to a child's home what what can you actually see when you go to someone's home i'm very tempted to do that exercise maybe i'll have why don't you talk to your the person next to you alright and and just tell the person  word just about your describe your room to that person or your house you can talk about what kind of painting word  on the wall whether you have shelves or posters whether you have karaoke sets word 
Singapore	although i'm inclined to lock the door alright i don't need that many handouts since there's only less than half a class here let's start on this side six pages okay i think we should begin we've wasted enough time people coming late let's pick up where we stop the last thing the last lecture we look at the application of kinetics in the biological treatment we left off looking at a simple case simplest case that is a cstr and we also look at the cstr that is without recycle uh do you recall your adapt uh your connection activator's sludge and all the other arrangements there would almost invariably would have they would have a recycled word right so let us look at this case now where there is a recycled  word  okay before we have our reactor our cstr your inflow coming in this uh mix well cstr i suppose to the previous uh arrangement you saw now we've got a settling unit and part of it is recycled now in this case our we have sludge wasted from the reactor that is a certain stream is taken off from the reactor i think the previous scheme i showed you uh sludge is wasted from the settling tank right so these are two possible arrangements you can have either sludge wasted from the settling tank i-e here or from the reactor and of course part of it is recycled back to the reactor and do you recall the there has to be a balance between the part of the sludge that is wasted to the sludge that is recycled and i'm sure you know why there has to be this balance right okay let us let us now look at the analysis of this arrangement okay the usual assump usual assumptions made are before two things number one x-y is zero that is your inflow comes in where's no micro-organisms okay this second assumption made well actually it's not this one but 'cos your x by the z is zero alright and and in this case actually we  word have another assumption x-e is zero i-e your effluent leaving your settling tank is x x-e zero okay now because of the presence of the settling unit you made two additional assumptions first of all waste stabilisation occurs only in the reactor that is here that means you're saying there is no waste stabilisation occurring in the settling tank now this of course will be conservative since there will be some degree of waste stabilisation by the micro-organisms in the settling unit as well right but for analysis we make this assumption that any b-o-d ah with  word taking place only in this unit secondly volume use in calculating the mean cell residence time all the system includes only the volume of the reactor unit okay so since this follows up from here right since there's no b-o-d  word in this unit alright you may consider the mean cell residence time you only take into account the volume of your reactor okay so by definition the mean hydraulic retention time all the reactor that teta will be d over q v will be your volume of your reactor that your fluid b ah b is constant this time if you consider hydraulic retention time for the systemthen for the system b will be reactor volume plus word tank volume alright so your mean cell residence time teta c we call that definition teta c will be mass of cells in the reactor over mass of cells wasted per day mass of cells in the reactor that's v-x in the reactor mass of cells wasted per day that will depend on your scheme alright if you look at your flow sheet up here if you look at your reactor mass of cells wasted per day if you draw an overall uh boundary surface here or control surface okay cells leaving the boundary would be this one q-w-x plus anycells leaving from the settling tank okay which is q minus q-w x-e alright q-w would be word liquid containing biological cells to be wasted from the system okay in this case from the reactor x-e concentration of your micro-organisms in effluent from the settling unit and if you recall we also made the assumptions that x-e is close to zero alright now this is the case for simple manure proper settling so the quantity of micro-organisms leaving there don't it's very small x-e approximates to zero then your mean cells residence time simplifies to q teta c is c over q-w alright and if you do the mass balance for micro-organisms in the entire system your accumulation inflow outflow and your net growth accumulation term the outgrowth this is the amount leaving the reactor the amount leaving the settling unit and that will be your net growth so now we come back to the assumptions we say we usually make assuming cell concentration and inflow is zero i-e x-y is zero steady state the x vility is zero then this means this is zero this is zero and simplifies to you just bring over this side you get this expression here equals to v multiplied by r-g prime r-g prime being your next specific uh your net growth your net ah bacterial growth rate alright and of course your r-g prime is equals to this expression here without the x term so if you divide by d-x and if you look at this term here and what we define as one over teta c in the previous transparency this actually would be one over teta c alright in the previous transparency this term here the left hand side term is one over teta c for substituting of teta c the one over teta c is equals to this expression or teta c is y-u minus k-d and if you recall the previous treatment teta c one over teta c is ec of exactly the same expression for the case of a cstr without recycle again the expression is exactly the same whether or not here is recycle of course the difference now is how you calculate teta c because now one over teta c is not for teta c is not the same as teta in a case where there is no recycle right so that's word  otherwise expression is really the same and substituting your substrate utilisation your your utilisa your substrate utilisation rate to this expression you can get your effluent concentration so your your concentration within the reactor x and of course in the case where there is no recycle these two terms are the same you cancel out and that will be the term that will be the expression you have seen earlier okay i repeat if there is no recycle teta c equals to teta you cancel out so you you see the expression earlier as well any any question as far okay now this expression actually would suggest that uh this expression it would suggest that if you reduce the hydraulic retention time then your m-l-v-x-s or your x value here would increase in the reactor right does it not suggest that if you increase your hydraulic retention time teta which is v over q then x will increase assuming everything else remains constant alright but of course there's a limit to to this because if you were to decrease your hydraulic so if you were to increase your hydraulic retention time rather if you de if you decrease your hydraulic retention time x will increase but if you decrease your hydraulic retention time it also means your cells are to be more liable to be washed out alright hydraulic retention time decreases such that it approximates your cell regeneration time then your cells will be liable to be washed off right once your cells are washed out then your s is going to approximate s nought which means you're going to have virtually very little treatment right but of course i said if you in if you decrease teta c teta rather and everything el everything else is held constant but of course you know that cannot be true because if you were to decrease if you were to decrease teta c teta rather teta c will also be affected right do you recall the definition of teta teta being v over q v is constant so to decrease this that means you must increase your flow rate q right if you increase your flow rate q teta c would also change in fact teta c would decrease as well alright so we we look at this case where the cells are wasted from the reactor as i said the other arrangement which is actually more typical would be like your cells or your sludge wasted from the settling tank so this second arrangement is actually the more common arrangement alright now instead of a cells being wasted from your reactor now it's taken out from your settling unit so redefining the terms slightly we've got this prime here we can then applying the same definition word just see for this case this is the mass of cells in the reactor of course that's the same mass of cells wasted per day this time this would be the mass of cells that is wasted from your settling unit that will be the amount leaving your settling unit alright so distance here will be changed slightly again assuming x-e is very small then it simplifies the this expression so to calculate x which is your concentration of your ah cells within the reactor it's the same expression as you've seen before same expression except that now teta c takes a different expression alright i have discussed only about x so far what about your substrate concentration or your b-o-d which is s we can do likewise do a substrate balance okay do a mass balance for the substrate now for your word  system then you have the x vitity or divide by v q-s nought which is the substrate coming into the system the same thing whatever substrate leaves the system and whatever is consumed here you can do the same thing and try to get an expression for s alright any question so far okay if not with that i'd like to cover our secondary treatment and i want to move on next to discuss about tertiary treatment systems or what is commonly termed also advanced waste water treatment okay now treat water treatment now although secondary treatment purposes may reduce more than eighty-five percent of b-o-d or suspended solids or possibly even more than eighty-five percent and also nearly all pathogens are removed if you recall we introduce disinfectants disinfectants however only a mi only minor removal of some pollutants is achieved okay examples of some pollutants of concern because there's only minor removal will be things like your nutrients word  nitrogen phospherous colloidal particles refractory organics dissolved inorganic solids so these are some of the pollutants that are of concern because after secondary treatment you may have only removed uh a very small percentage now addition treatment used to remove these pollutants are termed advanced waste water treatment or aw-t or tertiary treatment and in order to in relation to solving these tough pollution problems i-e taking care of these alright the processes the processes will will be effluent quality to the point that it may be adequate for many reuse purposes alright so it will convert what will otherwise be a waste water to a valuable resource i think in the case of singapore this is particularly relevant alright because we are relying on water from our neighbours so this is something of uh relevance in effect it's not only of relevance but importance as well actually recently there was an mou signed between nus and env that's ministry of environment and amongst the projects we're looking into would be one which we call uh technology development for water renovation  well in a nutshell it's a-w-t all we're trying to do is to recover or reuse our waste water so that they can be recycled back to the industry and be reused alright 
Singapore	okay good morning class now we have a guest today brenda lee is it your last name lee she's here to tape uhm the lecture for uh research uhm today is the last lecture for for the history of music course ah and we'll be covering very briefly uhm compo composers and compositions from the nineteen fifty onwards none of these compositions that i'll be mentioning are on the wide listening list these are additional works which you might have to identify to in the unknown so okay please listen to the features of these composition when you ah are listening now uh okay by the nineteen fifty now a majority of performers and composers had already familiarised themselves with uhm the twelve tones serial technique of schoenberg word and webern as we were discussing two weeks ago uh not all of them accepted the serialisation techniques of these composers but for those who did such as babbit b-a-b-b-i-t and messiaen those that adopted the twelve tones techniques went further and serialised almost all aspects of music composition uh aspects such as anyone what else do you think could be serialised other than notes i mentioned this before how come you're suddenly silent today what else what else could be serialised okay dynamics of course uhm dynamics one aspect one other aspect rhythm another aspect metre metre as two-four three-four tempo and most importantly colour colour as you know from uh webern's class father melody alright it opened all tempo possibilities for serialisation okay class father melody is very important so you'll have to remember now these composers favoured more control with con more control over their compositions so they wanted every aspect of their composition serialised and on the other hand there was another group that favoured less control over their composition now these composers included cage cage boulet b-o-u-l-e-t stockhausen s-t-o-c-k-h-a-u-s-e-n of course stockhausen and boulet also wrote serial ah serial music okay now there were two opposing camps and one favoured music as thought thought processing huh control and the other as sound two camps one is thought and one is sound freedom also during the nineteen fif fifties you have another new trend involving the use of electronically produced and manipulated sounds its term called musique concrete m-u-s-i-q-u-e c-o-n-c-r-e-t-e where musical tones or national sounds are transformed in various ways by electronic means musical tones or national sounds are transformed in various ways by electronic means and assembled on a tape to be played back for performance and assembled on a tape to be played back in a performance okay so these compositions are not live compositions they are pre-recorded compositions these composers stockhausen was very uh important uh component of this s-t-o-c-k can be purely electronic sounds i was looking for studio one ya because mr ho's not around alright no word  just continue okay we'll tell you later okay there are composers such as stockhausen who experimented very much with musique conrete uh and some of them also use uhm purely electronic sounds they use uhm synthesizers to make these kind of sounds as opposed to stockhausen who use voice as as well as in word  hi john you're late and because of the stringent requirements of this kind of music regarding dynamics uh rhythms of word minute  word speech and intensity of course the electronic studio is ideal for this kind of recording and john here discussing uh modern music with for this lecture also during this time we had composers who experimented with different combinations of instruments with different timbre combinations ranges and those who expect exploited new sounds that came from old instruments this is a score of one composer george crump you can see very unorthodox way of scoring 'cos it's centric huh you can see and you see the arrows they point uh where the beginning and the ending of the piece occur and it's scored rather freely uhm you see all these little stars little little asterisks uh  word which we learn the last time two weeks ago huh and he makes the uhm electric guitar play with plastic rods a very unusual instrument and combination of that okay this is the score of george crump one such composer also we had tone clusters very new sounds and they are scored this way on this way or like that sometimes okay and it can be anything from this to this anything but the of course the composer would uhm indicate which is the top note and which is the bottom note huh so this would be written down the the range will be written down okay composers who wrote for piano one henry cowell american composer who wrote uh music as early as the twenties who wrote this kind of music as early the twenty they incorporated tone clusters another innovation came from john cage c-a-g-e we spoke of them earlier who wrote very much for the prepared piano prepared piano in the nineteen forty where he had bolts screws spoons forks uh rubber eraser uh inserted in the strings to create a kind of percussion ensemble now of course you'll give instructions as to uh the pianist will reach for the inner key and play this this string or that string in a particular manner or fashion or to strike a string inside the keyboard rather than on the white key these are new innovational techniques also uh popular were the new harmonics that were explored at this time techniques new harmonic and new techniques such as the increased use of flutter tongue technique in wind instrument  word you had chromatic clusters and all the voice the spoken word as well uhm as you can see the voice has to speak certain things indicated huh very syllabic words of vowels sometimes or whispered sounds or halfway between voice and speech question mark uhm uhm uhm can you repeat the part on increased use of tongue from john cage oh in the new there's a new use of harmonics and techniques techniques will include the use of flutter tongue know what i mean what is flutter tongue where the tongue face and against the palate and and rolls them into the instrument ya will you demonstrate that again uhm of course you have to blow an instrument at the same time huh and do that okay glissandos glissandos the chromatic clusters and for the voice we had spoken and whispered sounds as well as word which is in between singing and speech occasionally the instrumentalists were uh requested to say these sounds too to participate vocally rather than just playing the percussion ensemble well increased in size as well and there was a a greater need for more exotic instruments that were being used instruments such as the gamalan uhm the gongs more asian instruments that were used this time for the sirens when word siren a fire instrument to be used in the ensemble could actually it's a pity we took the uhm projector from here lah uhm i made this transparency to show you the trends that took place in the nineteen after nineteen hundred okay you can see we have experimental tradition right at the top nineteen twenties and we have mainstream okay mainstream we have people like ravel in the mid composing alongside and then under experimental tradition we have composers such as ives shoenberg webern word huh they were experimenting the twelve tone technique and various instrumental techniques okay then we had twelve tone techniques quarter tone techniques okay uhm thirties with sound mass noise uhm composers such as  word all compose so you see how they uhm the score is done is down it's grey and black lines and sheets of lines and if you wanna crescendo you see uh expansion of this kind of graphics thicker darker lines okay and there's no note uh written down just masses of colour or sound and after the thirties it branched off into less control and more control so under less control we have indeterminacy which is a an important term you'll remember and more control ultra serialisation such as babbit uhm babbit messiaen who serialised all as other aspects of their music such as colour dynamics ahah so on this side we have then we went further to go into computerisation where they use computers to write music uhm on the right hand side you can see we have use of new instruments after nineteen forties word is one of them just mention him uhm improvisation techniques like composers uh gave performers a free hand and doing what they want i'll go on further with this and parallel to this we see chance music which uh john cage is a very important proponent of this kind of music uhm and further down the line before sixties we see new instrumental technique improvisational groups further on and live electronic music that comes straight down from the experimental tradition and theatre music happenings and anti-art maybe i'll i'll make a copy of this for you all since you're can't read this okay so you see the tradition of the composers streaming ah taking opting for one route or the other but of course during the fifties uh it's a very experimental time and most composers dabbled at one or the other like stockhausen's works uh messiaen babbit too and some of them would also write for non serial or chance music okay then we go on to berio which i'll speak on briefly because uh i brought the cd along the songs for cathy which berio wrote for his wife cathy berberian b-e-r-b-e-r-i-a-n and i'll play the sequenza for you sequenza three for voice for his wife which he wrote in fifty six okay luciano berio b-e-r-i-o was born in nineteen twenty five in  word nineteen twenty five word  he's a composer conductor and teacher and explored much theater music he married uh the american singer cathy berberian in nineteen fifty whom he also wrote extensively for voice he wrote nine sequenzas in all for various solo instruments piano the harp the trombone the voice and you see in his compositions the sequenzas uh a tendency to uhm have very theatrical features in it for instance the sequenza five were trombone i'll read you the instruction okay for the trombonist who's supposed to perform this work okay if you look at the score huh instructions are right at the top and this is the composition itself for the trombonist a very different way of scoring okay he says this is the instruction uh on the stage a very low stand and a chair okay so on the stage you're supposed to have a very low stand and a chair stand as in instrumental stand walking on the stage during the performance of section a the performer should wear a white tie could be a word or could be a word strikes the poses of a variety of showmen about to sing an old favourite right uh inspired he extends his arm raises his and lowers his instrument slowly or quickly uhm with movements which should appear spontaneous he hesitates just before section b he utters a bewildered why and sits down without pausing he must perform section b as though rehearsing in an empty hall okay these are the instructions very theatrical and you can see it's very staged and locations are given here for those who didn't have this now i'll play for you sequenza three which i unfortunately i don't have a score to this word is written for his wife cathy berberian sequenza three written in nineteen sixty six and it's divided into ten second bars okay the bars are timed in ten seconds so rather than the conventional bars ten second bars and involves detailed and specific features sound tones speech whispers there are forty four different emotional indications in all and the text is by markus kutter  this is the text and it reads 'give me a few words for a woman to sing a truth allowing us to build a house without worrying before night comes' this is the text and this is going to run for seven over minutes 
Singapore	uhm you can collect them settle down okay and let's begin tay seow ming shocked at your marks is it okay let's begin good morn uh good afternoon class  greetings  sit down alright now what we will do today for the first half hour or so is i want to uhm go through the answers alright for the assignment questions that are given to you okay you all settle down please alright the first assignment question was question five c okay i think most of you manage to do this question but some of you well i don't know what to say here ah but anyway this is the answer right now in the question five c you were asked whether a precipitate will form when the ph of a point 01 mole per dm cube solution of magnesium chloride is adjusted to ten now in the previous tutorial i gave you this hint right the hint the key word is supposed to be ph ten that means your solution is alkaline alkaline meaning that there is an excess of oh minus for hydroxide ion so you have to calculate your concentration of hydroxide ion alright and you do this using your poh value okay so your concentration for hydroxide will be ten to the power minus four mole per dm cube now why are you interested in this hydroxide ion concentration because there's a possibility that your ng two plus that comes from your magnesium chloride and your hydroxide can come together to form your white solid magnesium hydroxide as a precipitate okay right so you are not concerned about magnesium chloride your concentration of chloride ions you're more concerned about these two okay so you have a concentration of hydroxide you have a concentration of word  so what you do is you calculate the ionic product okay uhm some mistakes are you forgot to raise your oh minus expression to the power of two okay now anyway your ionic product will be this value which far exceeds your solubility product of magnesium hydroxide therefore you can compute that uh precipitate word  four okay so for question five c right you cannot say that since magnesium chloride is a soluble salt no precipitate formed you have to bear uhm bear in mind that it is an alkaline solution alright any questions no okay question six question six right uhm for this one what you have is a saturated solution of hydrogen sulphide alright now you are given a specific concentration of metal ion and a specific concentration of hydrochloric acid okay so your metal ion it's concentration equals to one mole per dm cube alright now your concentration of hydrochloric acid because this is a strong acid it will completely dissociate so this will be equivalent to the amount of h plus that is present in solution which is zero point two five mole per dm cube okay right now what we have to do then is to calculate the sulphide ion concentration you don't know how much of it there is so what you have to do is you write up the expression okay that has been given to you you can copy this from your tutorial alright now some of you make careless mistakes here you forgot to square your expression right it's been given to you that it's h plus whole thing squared but you didn't do that right now what value do you substitute inside since the majority of your h plus comes from your hcl you use point two five mole per dm cube okay right now from this you can solve for your sulphide ion concentration right the value is one point seven six plus ten to the power of minus twenty-two mole per dm cube alright now the next thing that is of concern to you will the ionic product alright exceed the ksp for your metal sulphide or will it be less than okay because if it is less than there will be no precipitation okay if it is greater than then a precipitate will form now it's necessary that you put these two statements down whether it's greater than or it's less than alright you cannot straight-away cons uh uhm conclude oh the ionic product is equal to a particular value that's all therefore such and such will precipitate out and such and such will not precipitate out okay you must give me the inequality signs here so that at least i know you understand what you're working out and that you did not copy from somebody else alright some of you had very obvious copying uh okay next time try to copy more intelligently modify your answers slightly now what's your ionic product okay your ionic product might be this multiplied by this okay right and all you have to do is see whether this value exceed or is less than the ksp for that particular salt uhm sulphide whether it's cadmium manganese iron or nickel okay now in this case you probably should get uhm which one uh calcium sulphide and nickel sulphide being precipitated whereas manganese and uh iron is not precipitated out as a sulphide okay right in question seven a you're dealing with silver chromate now silver chromate uhm what you want to do is you want to form a saturated solution without any of the salt precipitating out okay so what is the maximum concentration of ag plus that you can have right now how do you calculate this this means that your ionic product for silver chromate must be exactly equal to ksp okay because when your ionic product is exactly equals to ksp the solution is saturated but there is no precipitate being formed alright so what happens to that uhm if you write out the equilibrium you know that for every one mole of silver chromate that dissociates two moles of h plus and one mole of chromate ion are formed alright so if your solubility of sil uh silver chromate is s alright the amount of uh ag plus formed will be two s and the amount of chromate formed will be s moles per dm cube so you equate the two concentrations to your ksp you calculate for s you should get six point three times ten to the power minus five yes pardon thank you alright now you go on to the next part it's not just enough to calculate solubility what you want is silver ion concentration alright which is twice the solubility of silver chromate oh yes another thing uh most of you always forget to put the unit so i deduct half a mark each time you do that alright so your silver plus concentration is that you want to express that in terms of grams per dm cube you multiply by the correct atomic mass okay you should get zero point zero one three six gram per dm cube again watch your unit now for seven b there was some confusion alright what you want to do is in this system that contains silver plus ion and chromate ion you want to dissolve hcl alright but you want to dissolve the hcl in such a way that you have a saturated solution but no precipitate will form now what is this precipitate that will form the precipitate will be silver chloride okay because hcl will dissociate in solution to give you the ions alright so what you have again like i always say it's soup of ion okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated now what you want to know is how much of this hydrochloric acid can i add such that these two can be present in solution and will not come up as a solid precipitate okay right so most of you misunderstood the question you thought that oh it's a completely new system i'm using a new solution that contains just silver chloride no alright you're using the same solution as in part seven a with a new twist now your bubbly hcl into it alright okay so how do you calculate this part the maximum amount of hcl that can be added first you need to calculate the maximum chloride concentration that can be dissolved alright and the only way you can do this is to equate this with ksp for a saturated solution of silver chloride now where did you get this silver plus from right silver plus from your original solution containing silver and chromate and ion right therefore your silver plus concentration is actually your answer to seven a okay right most of you equate oh silver plus equals chloride so you just put s and s so it's s square equals to ksp and you square it your whole expression you get your chloride concentration no alright that is actually misreading the question okay so your silver plus concentration you get from part seven a and from this you can calculate your chloride concentration which is a very small value uh right seven point nine four times ten to the power of minus seven mole over dm cube can you all see this you all are speaking the answer is it okay now for the next part alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of hcl that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay so what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles hcl that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright now you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your hydrochloric acid concentration this is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into ions okay so therefore your hcl concentration will also be the same value right and from there you use proportion to calculate the maximum mass of hcl in two hundred and fifty cm cube right you just divide the answer by four and multiply by the molecular mass of hcl you get a very small value okay okay seven point two seven times ten to the power minus six square alright any of you all have any questions yes yes no what you're talking about is ah you're confusing number of moles and concentration now whether i have two hundred and fifty cm cube or or one thousand cm cube solution alright a saturated solution of silver chromate will always have the same concentration of silver ion but the number of moles present in two hundred and fifty cm cube and present in one thousand cm cube will be different okay alright uhm now if you see in seven a okay what is the mass of ag plus in one dm cube of a saturate solution of silver chromate alright now that means your answer will be gram for every one dm cube correct isn't that another way of expressing concentration gram per dm cube okay or rather you can say concentration is actually how many moles of silver plus in one dm cube isn't that mole per dm cube that's also ag plus concentration alright so it's the number of moles in one dm cube yes yes ya oh no no no no if you read seven b ah what is the maximum mass of hydrogen chloride that can dissolve in two hundred and fifty cm cube of a saturated solution of silver chromate saturated solution of silver chromate and uh for seven b and seven a also saturated solution of silver chromate so in both cases seven a and seven b one is one dm cube the other one is two hundred and fifty cm cube however both are saturated solution and therefore no matter what the volume you have for solution your concentration of silver plus is still is still the same because both solutions are the same it's just that you have different volumes of them  however your number of moles of silver plus will be different there'll be more in the one thousand cm cube than in two hundred and fifty cm concentration is different what no there is no dilution you don't transfer or what you just use the same solution and you just bubble in hcl that's all okay alright any other questions none 
Singapore	so ancient ah okay okay so we'll finish up the last chapter before we go on anyway they are all related to soil so it's quite okay right i think if i'm not mistaken did i did i finish up this with you i did okay now i think uh this is too alright put it forward there thank you put it down okay we borrowed from the other class alright uhm did i show you the vertical section of uh word  soil now we have been talking about the different soil type okay so in agriculture we actually make use of certain part of the soil that is the top soil for our plants which we harvest after a few weeks' time okay like vegetables for example alright we grow them because the roots are not deep-seated so they occupy the top soil level now plants which grow in the soil for i mean the roots uh uh penetrate the soil deeper will penetrate to the subsoil level uh which uh as we know not very fertile ya okay and then of course most soil will not be able to reach the bed-rock level so most of the time we are making use of the top soil right tying your hair now is it now this one its its experiment uhm we did is this ah something like that ya uhm this is to show you which level is occupied by what the lower levels would be stones then we have large particles then small particles silt very small particles clay human and living material right so the top part okay this is when we get a soil sample and then you put in water alright and this last one here shows you the interactions that happen in soil alright you have got this okay let's start from the word  okay let's start from the left hand side rain water gets into the soil uhm we have plants which has group nodules so we have these nodules which can take nitrogen from the air alright the rain water drained away by gravity some of these water are absorbed is absorbed by the plant alright taken up by the plant at the same time you have nitrates which is due uhm done by micro  word bacteria and all these it contributes nitrate to the soil these nitrates will be taken up by the plants okay others will leach off alright then you have when the the uhm leaves fall and they decay after they have died so the bacteria and fungi will uh act on them decompose them and contribute nitrates to the soil of course we also have earthworm and other organism which are macro right in the soil which would uh contribute to the fertility of the soil by uh when they fall around they actually create uh what do you call that they aerate the soil okay so others we have mentioned before uh alright so this is the uh what is actually happening in the soil right okay okay right then we have a summary of the properties of sand and clay right now property texture okay particle size sorry sand you have large particle size whereas clay very small texture sand coarse texture soil is light and easy to work you have you have handled soil yesterday uh sand yesterday right the difference between soil and clay and sand you can actually tell the difference root penetration is easy but root support is poor because they are uhm uhm it's it does not hold the root tightly okay and for clay it's very fine heavy difficult to work root penetration is difficult but root support is good it's difficult for the root to penetrate but to support the root the clay soil is actually the best alright uhm air content uh for sand it's high large air spaces among the particles whereas for clay it's low small closely adhering particles okay porosity very porous water draining off readily whereas it's the opposite here and you have water-retaining capacity for sand it's uh very poor the soil tends to be dry and over here good but easily water-logged that means the water stay in there alright and the rest with capillarity we have done this mineral salts content for sand low as soluble salts are readily drained away because they they allow water to drain off readily alright and for clay it's high since salts are not draining off alright so if you are a plant uhm and you are found in areas where you can only find sand and you want to germinate uhm such plants would need to have special adaptional features like for example sandy soil if you are growing near the beach alright then you need to have features which will enable you to stand upright as well as uh absorb nutrients okay so uhm do you know which plants are found in sandy soil cactus in sandy soil is it desert okay alright are there any but cactus is because they do not need as much water they they store the leaves ya okay okay what about uh coconut yes coconut what what others casuarina okay the casuarina casuarina has a very specific uhm root system in the sense that it's very deep-rooted alright and it can uhm uh anchor very well that's why you see casuarina tree is actually uite big and could survive uh beach condition okay so uh clay soil will be you must be able to you know penetrate and uhm after that it's okay for you but in terms of getting water it'll be a bit difficult alright okay and also you must be able to uhm survive in the area if let's say it's water-logged your root system must be good enough such that it will not rot okay or you do not need as much aeration in your root system alright so that's the adaptation okay any uestion no then we go on to soil fertility this the last part uh after this we'll be going on to new chapter alright soil fertility i think you have this set of notes right if you want to take down points next to your notes please do so most of you did not bring your notes alright soil fertility depends on soil composition the composition of clay and sand is important if you are in the if you are growing in the region or rather if you are a plant you grow in the region where there is only clay it's very bad only sand is very bad you will be very lucky if you can find a place where you have good soil and then germinate and grow uhm that is the reason why dispersal of seed is very important if the if if you make use of a very good dispersal mechanism ah then you'll land in a good place and you will sprout there okay so uhm most of the time plants will produce lots of seed so that just in case you know uhm only a few of them would find a good place to germinate alright and a lot of time also the seeds are able to uhm remain dormant that is they do not germinate at all if they are uh blown to a place whereby the condition is not right so they will just stay there dormant and hope that another gust of wind or animal or whatever will bring them to somewhere else to germinate okay so soil condition is very very important to plants alright so the soil should be well-aerated can retain some water so that uh leaching will not remove the soluble salts alright uhm fertility of the soil depends on ph if it is the soil is acidic then usually it's infertile because acidity makes the mineral salts very soluble alright and therefore these mineral salts when they are soluble in the water it will leach off so that your soil becomes poor because all your mineral salt or most of the mineral salts would have been gone will have leached off okay uhm alkaline soils usually fertile high in mineral salts content but if it is too high then the salts are insoluble and therefore cannot be taken up by plants so again uh you have to strike a balance okay uhm but soil fertility is usually maintained by activities of organisms living on or in it this i've mentioned bacteria blue-ridge algae actinomycetes fungi protozoa nematodes arthropods and earthworms alright fertility is lost in agriculture alright natural cycles interrupted if you if you uh use a piece of land for agriculture you do not allow the natural cycle to occur you see because you are ploughing you're using the land for your own purpose alright so you are interrupting the natural cycle okay and therefore crops removed and not left to decay because what you want is harvest so you remove your crops in actual natural situation is the word will be allowed to decompose and so on after they have gone through a cycle but if it is an word piece of land then that is not possible and so you are disrupting nature okay nutrients are not returned to soil because it is through decomposition that nutrients enter the soil alright okay types of soil we have uh different types of soil for different purposes okay sedentary soil okay situated on top of rock from which it is developed by weathering remember when we did soil we said that uhm soil is obtained when we through weathering of rock and so on so this the most or rather im immediate supply will be when rocks become weathered down by uh the different rain sun and all this type okay so you get sedentary soil alluvial soil will be composed of mineral particles which have been carried long distances from their place of origin through valley bottom and coastal plain and usually this is through by this is by what how how are these soil transported ah again water rain natural elements okay natural elements wind and so on okay alright topsoil and subsoil okay are with the top type of soil you have loam soil yesterday we give we we we did not have a chance to do loam soil but we had what uh what soil as you know in garden soil okay that is uh after it has been treated uh okay loam soil is supposed to be more fertile uhm i told you before long ago in agricultural land like in in different part of singapore where there are kampong areas right i told you that right how people get loam soil okay remember or not no i didn't tell you okay uhm usually long ago let's say long ago means less than fifteen years ago or twenty years ago okay we have got uh small corners around singapore where we have kampong and people living in kampong they have small uh pieces of land where they grow their vegetables okay so it's like self-sufficient alright now to get the fertilizer uh they normally do not use natural ferti uh artificial fertilizer that they they do not put fertilizer on into the soil so what they do is uh waste like uh paper decomposing leaves and so on they will collect that alright and pile up in a heap and uh they will sun these you know uh turn them over and sun and dry the after a few weeks they will light a match burn them so to you it might be environmental pollution but the effect is actually good because after burning these down become ashes and so on in a big pile okay so a lot of carbon uh nitrates and so on word  they do it they dig a hole bury these things inside alright keep them there then after some time alright they they do turn it over and over and after about two three weeks you'll find that the soil is become actual uh soil condition black soil okay and you'll have lots of earthworms there so they take this soil and they grow their vegetables okay of course there are farmers who will introduce earthworms to the soil to make it you know to to help out in the aeration alright and of course they also uh put dungs and so on and fertilizers okay only in recent years do we have uhm they use uh fertilizer as in tablets uh you know those round structures and so on but but these have got their disadvantages too okay we'll go into that later alright 
Singapore	can see or not clear or not i'm nervous you know laughter  okay ah let me introduce you to this pretty lady here alright she's a good friend of mine her name is brenda koh she's doing a some kind of a research on the kind of english i use right she's from nus okay what i say you no say okay look at the diagram on the board alright now i'm trying to make it easier for you hopefully ya from what i lecture on wednesday you may not understand let's look at it if i put a battery and i connect it directly to a n-type material what happens is there a current who say there's a current put up your hand one two three four five who said there's a current you all don't know i put up my hand means have lah you all never put up your hands alright there is a current what is the nature of the current infinity what is the measure of the current micro m how do you know micro m current equals to voltage divide by resistance alright the value of the current depends on the voltage and the resistance of this material alright what is the resistance of the material zero what's the resistance of material n-type material don't know don't know ah know or not know or not any material right resistance equals to rho l over a alright so sectional area is proportional inversely proportional to the resistance alright now so what happens if i increase the voltage what happen to my current increase or decrease increase okay voltage increase current will increase now what happen if i change this guy alright i said i want to use the n-type material but i want a narrower strip what happen to the current increase or decrease current decrease right alright area is smaller resistance is bigger current will drop okay so far so good so far so good okay good now your jfet has got one n-type material and two p-type material there correct okay let's say i put a voltage what happen this junction here what kind of biasing reverse bias this junction reverse bias right reverse bias alright now if it's reverse bias what happen to the depletion region increase or decrease depletion region widens alright so depletion region increase what happen to my channel my area here how much smaller area right smaller area if i increase my voltage what happen the current bigger but my channel is smaller current smaller right so my current will go bigger but it will not go as much as if there is no p-type material there alright so if you draw a graph alright or if i take the junction here uh vds and i draw a graph if this the diagram then as my voltage increases my current will increase word alright but if i put in this p material in between what happen is instead of going all the way there'll come a point where it will change in the rate of increase alright so it will start word  alright the increase will become smaller and smaller and smaller until a point where the depletion region touches one another it will stop once there's the this depletion region is word  formed there is no current alright so the current will remain constant this the case where we say it's equal to idss remember alright now when the depletion region is formed the current becomes constant why why it's supposed depletion region means no current what how come current is constant what saturated saturated alright now in your logical mind once it's reverse bias no current can go through isn't it alright no current can go through which is true alright just that the current can only go through the channel so once the channel is closed no current can go through alright but we say that this one stays at the saturation level because what happens is the depletion region no current go through and no current go through the depletion region will shrink once it shrink the channel is opened current will go again alright when current flow again the depletion grow again so it's a continuous process alright and as it goes on the current stays at that point alright we call this the saturation current for the jfet can or not okay now next thing i'm going to make it more complicated ah can i let's say i don't consider this voltage put in a voltage here alright put in available voltage here what happen alright in our diagram we call this vgg what happen to the junction forward or reverse bias who said forward bias nobody said forward bias kok fai okay reverse bias right both junctions are reverse bias okay now both under reverse bias what happen same thing depletion region will grow right depending on how big this voltage is that it will correspond to the growth of your depletion region okay so it can grow a little bit here and a little bit here if it grows like that you'll still have a channel you can pass your current through alright until a point where if you increase this very high these two will meet and these two meet there's no more channel no channel no current alright so these are the various conditions that we have in the jfet we have a case where vgs equals zero alright when we disconnect this guy and put this to ground alright that's the first case where we get this from this diagram then as we increase vgg you get a smaller channel and as you increase your vdd on this side the channel becomes smaller and smaller again alright but just now the time taken before it reaches saturation is faster because the channel is already smaller when we first started alright so you'll you will get a value that is smaller alright id will saturate at a value lower than idss alright and then at the point where vgg equals to your pinch down voltagea then it will join together and your id equals to zero all the time alright then you get a case where you call this the pinch down phase id equals to zero understand yes understood understood ah yes mr eddy do you know what you are asking or not come come come come ask ask can you all hear or not louder lah come on the mike cannot hear hurry up louder okay how come there's a reverse bias to the p and the n let's say i don't have this uh okay that's what you mean right that's what eddy this one is to ground is it have to connect to ground what don't connect to ground how must have got return path what alright just now i draw i don't put the ground because put the ground confuse people what supposed to have the ground an question answered right okay any more or not can understand okay once you understand we can go on common-source forward transconductance very chim term but actually don't worry about the definition alright it sounds very long doesn't matter all you need to remember is this formula okay this guy equals to this that's what it means alright ah i told you before engineers define things by equations so here we define gm as a common-source forward transconductance as change in id over change in vds for constant value or for a value of vds equals to zero that means to shock the you shock the drain source voltage alright this is current divide by voltage which is a conductance alright conductance is measured in word  alright typical values from one to ten word  now this this parameter can be found in your datasheets as per all the other alright same as all the rest okay this one is mathematics alright this equation we know uh id equals to idss into one minus vgs over vp square gm equals to this alright differentiate okay you all mathematicians differentiate this id with respect to vgs alright so vgs is your variable that you differentiate with respect to alright the differentiation take down the two so you get two idss equal vp alright put down the whatever inside here alright differentiate here word  outside alright i hope i integrated or differentiated properly alright then i don't want a negative sign so i put it inside here okay mathematics is sound nuh my maths okay uh now this value two idss divide by vp we give it another parameter name we call this gm0 alright gm nought gm nought equals to this so that gm equals to this one it's easy to remember easier to remember now this gm nought is defined as the maximum ac gain parameter of serving an a bias of vgs equals to zero well that's a definition of gm zero now what you need to know is alright what you need to know is these formulas alright these two that's all you need to know alright now the other characteristics that you can find in a jfet is found in your datasheet is this drain source on resistance when when the drain source is on alright when you use as a switch you have it on off alright so on resistance is when the switch is on okay what is the value of the resistance at the drain to the source that is what you measure alright and it ranges from ten to few hundred ohm this is another parameter that you can you need to know how to define okay what's the time now okay the time is thirty i can go on have i finished two thousand words not yet ah i no voice already actually i plan to stop here one you know but i haven't reached two thousand words so i must carry on alright okay never mind it's very fast alright the next topic is another kind of stp we call this the metal oxide semiconductor fet alright in short we call this mosfet m-o-s vp mosfet alright now mosfet is the way it functions is something like jfet with a little bit of difference alright and it's constructed with a gate terminal insulated from the channel that means instead of well my gate is these two instead of the two gates connected directly to the channel i use an insulator to insulate it alright that's what it does right and the insulating material is called silicon dioxide that's the materials alright and there are two types of mosfet one is called the depletion mosfet and it works very much like the jfet and then the other one is called the enlargement mosfet which works almost entirely differently alright depletion mosfet now this diagram can be found in your book uh the transparency not clear you can book okay i have again the drain and the source alright the these are the n-type regions okay the drain and the source is connected to the n-type the n channel alright the gate is connected to the p-substrate word  the p-type so it forms something like this the same thing alright so you find that here there's a channel on this side p alright the n is this one p surrounding all over the all over but this is just a sectional view it's not the it's not it's a piece word imagine a piece of block alright it's inside with the p-sucstrate all over alright surrounding it not just what you see alright the p-substrate is surrounding it so the same thing applies alright p-type substrate n-type channel okay now the symbol is this one alright this a symbol for the depletion mosfet source drain a alright and the arrow pointing inwards is what you call the p-substrate alright  if the substrate is n then the arrow pointing outwards alright i'll show you the graph afterwards okay n channel is physically constructed and embedded in the struc in the in the substance alright basically what i what i do okay i make a piece of n n-type and then i have the p-type i'll just squeeze it in something like that that's what it means okay how to do it so if when go for a word factory visit uh go and find out the current will flow between the drain and the source of the voltage connected across drain and source same thing as uh that one alright i connect it here from here to here i'll get a current going like that alright so this my my word connect to the n channel it will flow like that alright go across the channel okay how come not the other way conventional current flow is like that electron flow is like that okay it's how i it's how you put in your voltage source alright now you put in the the same thing applies there right the same kind of uh phenomenon that means if i if i put in the voltage the current will flow as the current flow the depletion region form and so on alright then the current saturate the same the same thing happens okay 
Singapore	folks say hi to brenda hi brenda is from nus and doing linguistics right ya ya and she's working on a project and so wants to record the uh lesson that i'm going to be giving today is she observing us or you uh no she's really not observing so much as just recording and then going back to analyse it right okay now what we're going to do today is a exercise in multi-track recording okay and specifically you'll be trying to record this commercial okay i don't have enough copies four of you'll have to share wait mike sorry i think you better join the other group 'cos i need two guys in a group okay pretty tacky commercial right okay nonetheless we'll this is what we're going to try to do now this is not an assignment in writing a good commercial or producing a commercial it's an exercise in multi-track production okay and for the purposes of actually putting together some program we're going to put together a commercial okay and the commercial is written with too many things in mind uh it's a wrong way to write it okay i wanted to have music i wanted to have sound effects of a crowd and a few other things and i wanted to make sure that most of them were girls because we we didn't have enough guys in the class okay that's not the way to write a commercial okay you normally identify objectives and write it from there instead of the other way around so this is what we'll be doing uh doing it through multi-track recording okay now the way that you're familiar with up to now is you combine two elements okay two audio sources on the console you record it onto a tape and then if you need to combine even more you use that tape as a source and combine a new element and then if you need to combine more you take that one and combine another one okay it could work that's a valid way of doing things the problem is if you handed in the tape to me at the very end and i said okay i think this's a good commercial right but i wish the music was louder over here or softer over here there's not much you can do because they've all already been combined you understand what i'm saying okay with the multi-track method what we'll actually do is we will record each element separately on a different track okay and we'll record each one at peak that means you're not uh fading or doing any any of that stuff yet we'll just going to record all of them at peak and then we'll sit down later on after all the elements have been recorded and we'll do the final mix that's when we all sit down and set all the levels and we we record it onto a two-track tape and then we listen to it and say well okay i think at this point the music needs to be louder or softer at this point the conversation is drowned by uh sorry the dialogue is drowned by the conversation at the background so we need to do something then you can just do it again and make those adjustments okay so multi-track uh recordings are more flexible in in that way okay now all tapes that go for broadcast all final master tapes will be on two tracks okay so you will not actually submit that the multi-track recording uhm as a final program okay that multi-track recording must be mixed down onto a two-track tape okay uhm tell emily that she should be word in the other room uh ah with mike okay what i want you to do is take a look at the script and try to identify the elements that they have okay and wait first we have sound effects right uh which one okay the uh we take it at a time conversation okay anything else what else okay with more sound effects okay the the can popping okay etceteras now strictly speaking the can popping and the drink being poured into a glass would be separate sound effects that you would have to combine in making the commercial but to simplify matters i've already combined them for you so that one follows the other then you can use it just like that so for the purposes of this exercise we count it as just one sound effect uh what else okay good and then and then we have voices right and we have more than one voice we'll treat each one of them as a separate element so who do we have we have jenny right we have jenny carol we have the announcer and the guy with no name okay so we have seven elements in a simple thirty-second commercial okay so it's not as easy as you think it might be now we need to record all of them separately and so let's take a look at the elements and figure out how many tracks you would actually need to record on okay it is not seven it's going to be more than seven the reason is because music always comes from left right down right it's in stereo okay so we would we would need uh two tracks to record the music sound effects also in stereo so you need two over here two over here okay and the rest of them are voices not in stereo they're recorded in mono so you need one track each okay so that's one and ten right so we would need a ten-track recorder to be able to record this commercial now there really is no such thing as a ten-track recorder okay they come in variables of two four eight sixteen twenty-four first okay then thirty-two thirty-six right so for our commercial we would need which one of those sixteen okay we'll need a sixteen-track recorder do you see any around do you okay we don't have a sixteen-track recorder okay so strictly speaking if you're a professional trying to record this commercial you would need at least a sixteen-track recorder what we're going to do today is to improvise a little bit okay we're actually going to do some combining of elements in recording some elements uh on one track so what we'll do is first uhm we would record the music on one channel so it'll no longer be in stereo it'll be in mono okay and we'll do the same for the sound effects and the other sound effect and we will record all of the four voices on one channel okay and we need a four-track recorder and do we have four-track recorder yes we do over here so we'll actually use the four-track recorder and we'll improvise a little bit okay the commercial will not be in stereo but for the purposes of what we're trying to do today to do a multi-track recording that should be sufficient okay and after this lesson you should be able to choose whether you want to adopt that kind of recording for putting your final projects together or if you want to if you want to do it the old way that you're familiar with mixing and re-mixing and re-mixing okay good now before we actually get started let me play back some of the elements i've got on uhm the cd no word switch on the main word  okay track fifty-two on this has either the the music or the sound effect let's see which one now uhm when you're looking for sound effects on a sound effect library or sound effect disk you may find ten fifteen different uh say party conversation each one slightly different okay even for something as simple as a car braking screeching to a halt there could be ten different ones because some of them take a long time to screech to a halt some of them stop immediately so they'll all come in uh different lengths okay so you have to choose appropriately sometimes you may find there isn't really one that you can adopt for your commercial in that case you actually have to go out and do the recording yourself now this party will do for this purpose but really it's it comprises of caucasians speaking it's not like an asian crowd right and uh at the party we want music that's playing in the background that we can mix together with the conversation to create that the whole effect okay on track forty-four on this one we have the okay with the music it would be better okay so play together it would sound okay so with music in the background playing on and then we'll and then we'll mix more elements between the uh dialogue between the people involved okay not to mention the and on the open reel i have already mixed for you the  word  i think uh it's being played back at the wrong speed ya okay so that's the sound of of a can of norbecker punch being opened and poured into a glass okay so you're you're familiar with all the elements that we're going to be using it's all there available word to put the  word together now what are the things you will notice when you're actually uh get the talent in front of the microphones doing the actual recording is that when the conversation takes place cold without any of the sound effects and the ambien uh the ambience of the party it would sound very strange it could even sound pretty tacky okay could you find that it gets a bit uh better when you mix it with the ambience okay and it would be the same for the sound effect of the can popping it may seem unusual it may seem too obvious too loud okay but next to everything it'll also get better any questions okay if no questions then you better get started putting the thing together because you don't have very much time since we only have two guys we're going to have a problem deciding uhm who's going to be the announcer and the guy i think it'll be a good idea to have a guy to be announcer alright because we have already two female voices and we don't want to have too many voices that sound alike okay so i think uhm david would sound pretty good with the announcer okay and robin of course would be the guy and uh that's incredible i actually have names okay very good so jenny will be jenny and okay now initially we don't really need you in front of the microphone okay let's try and figure out in what order we should uh put the commercial together what's the first thing you would do you know you start recording the elements one by one right okay which one will be the first one to record okay uh track one what will it be okay the okay the sound effects of the conversation and how long will you record that ya okay very good so we'll record for more than thirty seconds uh because we don't really know the commercial will be exactly thirty seconds so we can record more and during the final mix word we can actually get it out and off okay so we'll record about uh say forty seconds okay so we'll do that and then the next thing the music okay since those two actually last from the beginning till the end those are the first two that we'll do okay so on track two we record the music again for forty seconds right and on track three the voices okay now you'll notice that before the sound effect of the can comes up the dialogue is actually interrupted right  the dialogue is divided into two parts t and one after the sound effect so on track three we'll record the dialogue and up till the point when we hear the sound effect okay and then on track four we'll record the sound effect and then we come back to track three and finish recording the dialogue okay then we'll sit down and mix the final commercial together okay now you're familiar with how the two-track machine works but you haven't used the four-track recorder yet okay so if you'll gather around here let me demonstrate a few things that you should keep in mind the four-track recorder is pretty much similar to the two-track recorder except that you can record word i mean the functions are more or less the same to be able to record you want to put it on input to be able to play back you play it on word  you have both control select word over here  word so if you want to record music and the conversation on track one you push one down and leave the others up it will not record on the others okay when you finish doing the recording it already word  track two pretty straightforward right okay uhm just like on the two-track machine you have output and input controls if you put it on input you'll be able to actually manipulate the recording levels by using the input now okay now you'll notice on the input there's a word  over here that says c-a-l cal okay and it's actually indented so it'll actually stop there unless you you put it out of there and word  now that is the calibrated setting at that setting it will give you pretty good sound you can basically control the levels on the console you can forget about it but with usage over time if it hasn't been maintained and recalibrated uh it will lose its calibration okay so always worth keeping an eye on it just to make sure that things are going okay right but as i said nine nine percent of the time you put it on cal control the levels on the console you should be able to get pretty good recording alright so that part is pretty simple now there's a control here that says synch that you haven't used up till now and you would be using it for this uh production the way you use it is input is to record word is to play back if you put it on synch it can do both okay say that you've recorded on track one the conversation and until the sound effect comes about and then you want to record the sound effect immediately there okay so you would want to listen to the conversation so that you know exactly when to cue in the sound effect right okay so you want to listen to track one but record on track two that's what you you use synch for you understand okay well uh if you don't you will when we actually do the recording okay right any questions okay if there are no questions then let's get started uh word you'll actually produce okay of course with the assistance of uh the rest of the gang right your job is to tell them what to do okay so let's get started 
Singapore	 word introduce you to uh mrs lee she's a friend of mine from nus okay and she's going to record this lesson don't worry it's my word it's my uhm voice that she wants not so much for word  you after that terrible piece of work you have dare say anything else uhm right have you all got your papers back uhm sit down quick yes okay can i get the lesson going danny alright okay now uhm as you can see from your grades it was not very good i don't know why no it's upon fifteen dream on okay now have you got your passage with you right i think one thing which you all forgot to do was to read the question carefully okay read question word  the indians said the fish danced on the beaches at full moon explain clearly by using your own words what was actually happening and why it only happened when the moon was full were the fish dancing did they go one two three one two three no then why didn't you say so is it is it understood no it's not that's why they asked you the question in the first place so one of the basic things when you have to state okay sorry this ohp is not very clear uhm the first thing you should point out is that it's not true that the fish were actually dancing on the beach you don't state that you have not answered the question at all and that is why most of you ended up with out of four marks i gave you one and a half because you didn't answer the question alright but you have to tell them i mean they are assuming that i mean the indians say it's one thing right but you know it's not so logically you have to say it's not what the indians thought it was then after that you word  it's four marks you have to earn those four marks they're not going to give it to you okay now carry on with it okay it tells a story the female word came up onto the beach and uhm lay the eggs in the sand okay but what is important is that she laid them beyond the point where the tide reaches why the second half of the question asked you right what is the connection with the moon that's why you got to state this point here okay this point it's the circular twisting motion of the fertilizing males that looks like a dance here you have explained what actually is happening why is it that the indians thought the fish were dancing because the male fish are moving around the female fish now if this is not there out of four marks i can't even give you two okay the second half of the question what is the connection with the moon the full moon is important because it indicates the high tides when the eggs are laid there are two reasons for this the high tide will bring the female fish up onto the beach because she lays her eggs onto the beach right then after that what happens after she's laid the eggs she leaves them right she doesn't uhm she doesn't sit on the eggs like say the chicken would to incubate the eggs the eggs are left in the sand unattended to so logically no one else no other fish will come up onto the beach because once the high tide point has been reached subsequent tides will be lower they will be further back it won't come up as high the period of lower tides that follows the eggs will not be affected by the incoming water and can mature undisturbed it will be untouched it takes what nine ten days then after that the next high tide comes by that time the wa when the water reaches the high tide water mark the fish will be the new fish the newly hatched fish will be ready to go to the sea the water will bring them back that's why there is a connection with the full moon they need the pull the tides gravitational pull okay now you should be rephrasing your own words you should not have copied gyrate incubate uh undisturbed if possible uhm rephrase it by saying not affected alright the other thing that i think can you please write down somewhere on your answer script or on your passage the tense in which you should be answering your questions in i did not correct every uhm error made in tense because otherwise your whole answer script will be nothing but underlining of grammatical errors what tense should be used when you're answering this type of question leonard why past when do you use the present tense the simple present tense when do you use the present tense when do you use present tense obviously when the question is given in the present tense you use present tense is for when something is happening now right but what about facts and habitual actions they are on-going happening all the time therefore present tense should be used because this is something that happens in nature right and it will happen today it'll happen tomorrow it happened last year it will happen it will continue on for the next twenty years therefore when you're answering a question like this it should be in the simple present tense when you're asked to describe something that is happening in your text tense should be simple present you're not to use the past tense okay alright let's move on to the second question uhm all creatures except man are locked into the environment explain what this phrase tells you about creatures other than man illustrate its meaning from what the passage has to say about the hummingbird and the butterfly using your own words as far as possible alright now this phrase comes from line twenty three right locked in its environment but the reference to the butterflies and hummingbirds comes in line sixteen seventeen if you are locked somewhere what's the idea there uhm you're confined you're chained you can't move so the main idea which has to be brought up is that there is a dependency on the environment to survive he is chained to the environment now how are you going to use the butterflies and the hummingbirds to support your illustration the butterflies they have the ability to camouflage themselves as leaves or poisonous insects okay the hummingbird has the ability to hover and its long-probing beak allows it to suck nectar from the flowers that helps them survive in the environment but what happens if the butterfly doesn't have the flowers any more to feed on it's got a long sharp beak is it going to be any good for picking up worms or whatever assuming that it can consume worms no right it's only good for sucking up nectar therefore that implies it's only got one source of food same thing with the uhm sorry what am i talking about it's the hummingbird not the butterfly okay the hummingbird has only got one source of food now the butterfly brightly-coloured wings what does that allow protection right in the environment because it's camouflaged but if taken out of that particular environment it's brightly coloured it could be brightly coloured as if it's a flower or it could be very dully coloured so that it becomes inconspicuous but if you put it in another environment will it be very noticeable in this classroom yes right therefore the environment provides it with its protection but there is only one form of protection it doesn't have any other means of defence so these adaptations limit the creatures to a specific environment the birds have only source of food the butterflies have no other means of protection and that is why they are locked into that one environment if there're no flowers no nectar the hummingbird hasn't got any other means of food okay now there's one more thing which i noticed in all your scripts about at least half of your scripts no chalk here alright now listen to this sentence the butterfly is a creature uhm which has many enemies their enemies are and then i give you a list what's wrong with sentence the butterfly is a creature with many enemies their enemies are what's wrong with it uhm well doesn't matter there's nothing wrong with that creature it's a grammatical error between the two sentences the first sentence was a butterfly right then after that i continue it with their now if you look at your sentences a lot of you make that mistake you started writing off the first half of the sentence with in the singular protect themselves it should be protect himself do you see that mistake okay look for consistency in your answers okay uhm ya next one invent he had to invent a pebble and a a flint it could be said that invent is used incorrectly here why go back to the passage and reread it right whenever something is given in text go back and read exactly where it comes from because often the line immediately before that or after it will give you an idea or a clue as to what the question is asking of you okay okay so line about forty eight before that man is a puny slow awkward unarmed animal he had to invent a pebble a flint a knife a spear essential these scientific inventions essential to his survival what kind of ideas being brought up here he's unarmed if he's unarmed what does that mean he is defenceless okay therefore why does he find these inventions essential they're going to be used as protection weapons okay you've got a knife and you've got a spear now a very primitive spear how did the caveman prehistoric man make the spear he used a stone right he sharpened the edge and then he attached it onto a stick perhaps and that's it that's a spear so that's where your connection of a pebble a flint a knife and a spear > ice-sin:s1b-017#> that's why you've got these two simple things followed on with two inventions you see it's a bit odd right now you can invent a spear but you cannot invent a pebble so you've got to bring out that idea but the first thing that you forgot is that invent you have to give the meaning behind it otherwise you can't explain why it's incorrectly used state that to invent is to produce or create something that did not exist previously or was not in existence and then you go on and elaborate peb pebbles already exist uhm nature-endowed god-given whatever so these two together will give you one mark most of you gave me only this which will give you only half a mark alright now part b uh i think most of you went wrong here what does the author mean by this statement goes back to what i discussed with you earlier with reference to invent and what he was trying to invent okay the author means to discover or invent a use for the pebble you use it transform it into a weapon because man is weak he doesn't have uhm he's not he doesn't have any body adaptations which offer a form of protection to him he doesn't have sharp claws alright he doesn't have sharp teeth okay alright now i also return you your uhm exercise which you did for me explaining metaphors some of you in that exercise you followed the correct structure just as then whatever it is so right remember that structure which i ask you to pay attention to now what you've got are three metaphoric phrases which you've been asked to explain  even if you don't like following the structure 'just as' and 'so' you should have remembered that you are supposed to explain the literal meaning of metaphor first and then relate it back into the context first one would be 'an animal fits into its environment just uhm like one cogwheel into another' what you've got to explain is the concept of a cogwheel right what is it you think of a cogwheel you think of gears you think of wheels with with what what's so special about gears they've got two wheels right if i've got two wheels and i put them together is that a gear why mhm the edges they are grooved serated right they've got teeth on them so that when you put the two together they interlock and the turning of one wheel will turn the other wheel it's this kind of principle what's going on what's the problem i want to finish this first then i want to use the ohp is that a problem okay explain to me the concept of a cogwheel explain to me explain to me what i've just explained pay attention next time uh okay right the idea of teeth on a wheel okay one fitting into another interlocking so it's this idea of once you've explained that here right it's this idea of the smooth inevitable interlocking of creature and environment how the animal is able to adapt itself to suit its surroundings perfectly you explain this one first right a cogwheel wheel with teeth on it uhm the idea of gear one wheel turning another it's it's connected they fit perfectly and then you go on and explain how it is in use in the passage so this will be one mark and this one will be one mark 
Singapore	so class i hope that you will be able to share with your classmates those who are coming in now what i've explained to you about the sixty four cards and what you're supposed to do it is an individual response so there are no right or wrong answer i'll like to begin my lecture today by telling you that we have now come to the last lecture in our series on human resource management we have gone a long journey i hope you have found it interesting it was taught it was quite a number of months when i welcomed you to ngee ann polytechnic and when i welcomed you to do this human resource management program and we had got a few breaks in between and now dinner is ahead well it'll be nice if we can all go for dinner and celebrate but we can't do that now because your exam is just ahead of you today we want to deal on creativity we want to deal on creative problem solving a couple of weeks ago you had a lecture on the rational problem-solving approach today we are not doing the rational problem-solving approach we are doing the creative problem-solving approach and if you recall in our film on the abc of decision making the conclusion was that it is actually very good if you can base your decision on number one cold hard facts and at the same time combine it with some intuition and individual judgement in other words we cannot just simply rely on cold hard facts there are some problems and particularly when they affect people we have also look at it from the creative approach in other words we have to look at and find some new ideas so here you see two people having ideas but one of them uh sort of give up and do not follow up on the idea whereas another one follows up on the idea and cover up with some innovation so i'm sure you realise that many of the innovations we have today are because someone have a good idea and was able to apply that idea and uh i hope that you have read through your notes on creative problem solving page one i'll not go into detail about some of the definitions you should know for example what is discovery is discovery something already existing but unnoticed uh for example someone discovered the law of gravity gravity has always been there but nobody sort of discovered it or didn't notice it until somebody noticed an apple falling and asked why how come the apple fall like this why not fall upwards or fall sideways huh so i hope that uh you would also discover many things and you would also notice many things it's always good to open your eyes uh i noticed today for example that not all students are here is it correct i don't know where they are so you know what is invention and innovation huh basically invention you are doing something entirely new it's a new invention like before the telephone was invented uh that was really a new invention there was nothing before that like that huh but it can also replace something old of course and this is where innovation also helps to modify or update or refine an existing product so all this requires creative thinking and i'd like you to page to uh turn to page two where you have got uh the four mental powers i hope by now after reading these notes you are made aware that actually we have a very good brain and we have got four mental powers one of them is the power to absorb to observe to sense and to be attentive i hope that you are paying me attention now or be attentive to me and referring to your notes and you are absorbing through your senses now through your eyes and through your ears you are able to learn something that there is one mental power called the absorptive power and i believe that in the past week or so you have absorbed a lot of information and you have learnt a lot i hope and the second power that we have of course is a retentive power that means we not only able to absorb we are able also to retain in our mind we can memorise things we can retain we can recall and it is of course very good to have a this retentive ability in all of us and i believe that we all does have some very good memories it's a matter of uh knowing how to memorise using various tools to memorise for example i have told you how you can memorise the main points about why do people resist change you can't forget that any more right we all don't like to have the sack to be sacked uh s-a-c and you know how you can uh sort of uh make it more accepting to people where you make some changes use npb and ucc all these are just some tools for you to help you to retain and to recall and i'm sure you can recall many things in the past especially those things that you find very meaningful very interesting well of course we also forget quite number of things especially those things we find very boring those things which are no more relevant huh unfortunately and in fact i just went to my mechanic yesterday and he recall the last time i my car broke down was in the world trade centre he could recall that he talked to me over the phone i was very amazed so you see how uh if you can know your customers well like this uh it's very useful actually now this is how we learn but of course we do not only uh have these two mental power we also can reason we can also be creative and this is where i have taught you a bit more about thinking and i have uh shared with you in a few lectures before on the rational problem-solving approach where the main emphasis is to use reason the main emphasis is to analyze things to assess to evaluate to judge and to come to certain conclusion based on various logic or various reasons huh that is the rational problem-solving approach and we all can reason however there's only one mental power and we also need to now come to the fourth mental power called the creative mental power that we have and this is the ability in which we can generate ideas and we need to have more and better ideas we need to be able to foresee things and we can only foresee things if we use our creative mental power we need to able to visualize to see ahead and this visualization that we have which of course has to do with our power of imagination uhm they we all say that we inside our mind there's what's called a mind's eye there's an eye there huh it's just an illustration to say that we can imagine visualize we can feel can you imagine now getting the diploma can you imagine yes you can imagine can you imagine mr teo sitting in the hall clapping one by one as you come up to receive your diploma can you imagine can you see mr teo yes you can imagine i can also imagine you coming up in a very nice white dress uh most of the students are wearing white on that day very smart can you imagine yes you can it is very important for us to be able to imagine certain things and this is where we come to the imagination the power of imagination there is creative imagination and word  imagination visual imagination and vicarious imagination so you read the facts on your own it says there that uh our imagination will affect our emotion because just now as i talked to you about graduation day you have a sense already of achievement of pride of happiness all my two years working here had come to the fruition huh can you imagine it you can feel affect your emotion and there the untapped power of imagination almost unlimited we are not tapping it enough uhm according to psychologists we only use only ten to twenty percent of our mental potential and uh imagine at four different parts the creative imagination where you try to imagine something creatively huh take for example my friend or my colleague uh she did this i think it's very nice she just bring all these to get i can't do this uh but it shows that she could imagine and she could creatively that create a bouquet like this put it in a nice place uh appropriate places anticipative imagination what you expect you shall find so what do you anticipate if you can anticipate for example this question will come out that question is more important it is very useful you would anticipate your boss to be very angry today your boss will be very nice today your boss will be asking you this your boss will be asking you that it is very good to be able to anticipate uhm the visual imagination uhm you're able to see certain things visually so some of us can see better things than others huh we can imagine very clearly when i talked to you about graduation day you can see not only people you can see colours and so on uhm at last vi vicarious uh that means you can feel for others i imagine that when i said that to him he would have felt very happy or he would have felt very sad if you can have a vicarious imagination it's also very useful in your interpersonal relationship huh how do the other party feel how would he have felt if i were in his shoe how would i have felt or how would he have felt huh so all these things i hope you would see it to be of value to you and we go on to the how does the mind therefore develop a new thought page three are you following me on page three uhm this's also a very interesting uh thing because it tells you that our mind works in a progressive manner and first of all we must sense or we must recognize that there is a problem if we don't recognize of course we don't we can't uh proceed and so there are two aspect of it one is to be able to detect the problem and the other one is to able to find a new approach to the problem so actually what is the problem problem definition here and to approach it from a different angle huh next preparation you have to prepare yourself gather various facts on uh data that is pertinent to the problem and this part of it actually is very necessary uh you have to prepare there is no short cut uhm unless you got certain input you can't really proceed very well but after you got all the necessary input and you're able to sense or to recognize the problem from different angles then you come to a more uh subconscious or even unconscious called incubation where you are sleeping over the problem somebody will say aiyah i think we cannot find the answer today let us sleep over it and think it over you know in our quieter time or something like that and you will find that this is uh where your mind your conscious mind then let your unconscious mind that means a bigger part of your mind think about it and sometimes you may have realized that uh after you had a good sleep you wake up oh you say ah i have found the solution oh now i know the solution huh  this is what my by mean by incubation and sometimes you may take uh days or weeks even to come up with the idea huh but it is now being incubated huh you all know what is incubation and then you come to illumination where you see the light huh illumination so now you have a bright idea the light switched on huh illumination you would say 'hah ah' or 'eureka i got it or i found it' is it huh this is the meaning i know the answer now suddenly out of the blue huh you may have got this type of experience also but of course the last point is that you have to verify it is it really workable does it need some refinement and polishing and so on uhm 
Singapore	okay i'll have a deal with you if you keep quiet and i get through this part okay you're going to view a tape and you can get your own back on me get back on me because i used to nit nit-pick on everything right that you do so i can i'll show you one of the uhm stories i did for life and times and then you can criticize okay so if you guys don't pay attention fine i'll just drag this session on you all want to take your revenge yes okay what is a documentary sh what is a documentary it's a uhm you can see fantastic you've got x-ray eyes or something okay what is this closest to a documentary it's closest to a news story and like a news story it is factual it is based on real events copy fast fast uh okay well just because you're not examined on it you don't want to copy that's fine with me too you know then i can move faster alright what does it records and documents in other words what can a documentary cover it can cover an event a moment in history okay like the very first election or the referendum whatever or a person's life the life of c k tang a documentary on c k tang have you seen the guy why do you laugh a way of life okay you might want uh want to document the the changes kerwin go through word metamorphosis of kerwin heng social behaviour okay what sort of social behaviour can you think of for that documentary oh dating courtship love oh please please uh okay things like that you know a documentary on mental illness etceteras so a documentary can be on whole variety of topics but it actually goes beyond the who what when and how what is it that makes the documentary different a documentary explains the why questions you guys do news writing who what when how you hardly can cover the why in a news story and all the more not so for a tv story a tv news story there's no time to explain the why unless you take more than two minutes so in a documentary it actually explains the why now if there are so many similarities how is it different from a news feature more in-depth and how would it affect the look of the documentary then if you have to cover something more in-depth what happens you need more time okay first of all you notice that a documentary is much longer ah must it always be slow-paced what sort of documentaries have a slow pace what have you seen nature ya those are mostly slow-paced or some sometimes documentaries on behaviour mental illness you actually need to show the person's uhm actions and and behaviour right in its actual context rather than just hitting all over so the length uh and the pace depends on the story itself the angles and the areas covered of course as you pointed out more in-depth so you cover from various areas various angles looking at the topic from different angles and pace and rhythm now some documents may be slow-paced right through slow-fast-and-slow because you have to sustain interest for half and hour for an hour it depends now i can't even keep at my own okay actually follows through it's a follow-through of an event or a period of development okay either you document it as it happens that's what most documentaries all are uh are are about they document things as it happens but sometimes things uh have already happened what do you do what can you do if something has already happened and you want to document it still you re-enact right by possible dramatization or re-enactment how many of you have seen uhm my name is bertha my name is nadra not bertha okay that is uh what do you call that kind of documentaries docu-drama or dramatized documentary ya now dramatized documentary a dramatized documentary has some problems what is one of the main problems that a documentary uh producer of a dramatized documentary would face accuracy in what sense well basically because when you are dramatizing something you take some dramatic licence right and that can border upon some fictionalization you over-dramatize it so that it it's more compact and more interesting for uhm television so in other words what happens is that if you over-dramatize it or you may add on little details which is so-called not true okay and when that happens the persons involved or even the institutions involved can sue you you know they took a long while over this documentary my name is nadra not bertha it's started well the producer started doing it before i left sbc and was just telecast this year and that's because of sourcing for the p people alright getting the person to well getting the various persons to talk about what happened so that when they get the actors and actresses together they can actually portray the people involved in that charac in that in that uhm uhm mannerisms or whatever you see so if the person is very energetic he'll por portray that image someone who is very soft and gentle you have to portray that image too okay okay what's involved in a preparation and production of a documentary what's involved in the very first very first thing you have to do say for a new story research okay research you have to find out as much as possible at this stage we should never purposely exclude information what happens when you do decide to say highlight a certain angle of a document word  an an issue and you exclude all other issues you may distort okay you may distort the story you have a you need a full understanding of a topic before you actually zero in on the angle you want so there's content or subject research you read up you find out about the subject materials research now this is slightly different from the content research okay later on i'll show you this story on uhm at the movies it's about uhm it's tracing the various uh tracks of movies that have passed through the ages through singapore cinema etceteras so okay i want to do something on cinema the very first cinema i know it's uh it's along beach road but where do i find it i mean so i've to research and check out what sort of materials do i get black and white photos from archives or word  footage film footage okay word have to look for materials and you have to check whether what you read about whether it can be portrayed or visualized then of course there's a location surveys the location survey is really for you to go to that place it's like being there but sometimes you can't go on a location surveys right sometimes you just have to go and see for yourself like the last time when you did hong hong bao special even you have to survey the location you can't figure out what happens and so you have to play by ear now there're times of course you can actually use your common sense even though you don't survey that place you can find out look for let's say i'm supposed to film an missile covet the lady's uh gunboat and nuh okay i went for the resear uh res uh recce but i can't bring the whole crew along so what can i do i'll ask the navy for magazines alright and in the magazines they'll of course they will have pictures of their their gunboats etceteras and i'll show it to my camera crew so in a way you're surveying and researching for them too so think of all the means you have whatever is within your means to uhm get well get yourself well-prepared and yours your uh production team to be well-prepared too now besides that you also have research interviews interview people concerned talk to them before you actually record the interview for a video and at the end of course you've to collate your research okay now in collating your research you're actually preparing a sort of a script for those of you who whom i taught for one session for radio last semester remember i did something on uhm sbc uh english drama so the various areas you know that we can discuss uh if you were to deal with it as a story what are the ang various angles you can take right you can talk about singlish you can talk about local playwrights you can talk about uhm stories with a local context okay so you have to collate your research and when you prepare your script bear in mind many stages many drafts and each draft will get better and closer it should really get closer to what its story should look like in the end first stage treatment what else you should all know what a treatment should contain right those who don't do not go out and say uh miss lee taught us because i didn't not teach you did not not teach you what a treatment is a treatment is supposed to sell your story now your editor may say okay go ahead with the treatment just for audience sometimes you may be doing a documentary for overseas consumption your audience is different so you have to bear that in mind too now in a documentary it's quite different from a news story okay you may be able to figure out okay in this story in this news story this is the kind of angle this is what's new that's why i'm going for this press conference or that's why i'm attending this event in a documentary things are you may probably have to count from the people you interview something that's new something that's not being talked about or little known but you're not going to give put the headline right up at the top right you probably have an outline an outline strip covering the various areas okay so you'll be uhm what you call an outline script or a shooting script now you can't predict everything that can happen during a documentary because things unfold as you go along especially when you're covering uhm things that's uh of a present moment alright you do a documentary on a present event so you have an outline uh script to guide you okay based on the research these are things that might happen and these are things you can shoot and you work along you you would uhm revise your script as you go along it's really what you call scripting the unpredictable now when you say you're scripting the unpredictable it is say you don't really not have a script you have a partially scripted uhm script with you to say okay uhm what can we talk about say when i went to holland to do a story on frozen pork ugh frozen pigs sorry for students muslims but you know i had to i have to go to holland to do a uh little story for friday background it was in line with this eat frozen pork word  because they were phasing out the the pig farms in ponggol so i really didn't know what to expect because i've never been to a factory before they will slaughter the pigs and freeze it freeze the pigs within two and a half hours alright the hygiene conditions etceteras so what i wrote into the script for all the camera crew would be uhm as we go along alright these are various steps and i'll write down you know uhm they told me there's slaughter there's the burning you know uh singeing the pigs so that the bristles will fall off etceteras  ya so i'll write down the different steps but when you are there it's really playing by ear i don't know what to expect but even so you have to decide okay what are the cut-aways as we go along of course there's this chap who was with us from the factory and someone from the meat association and he'll tell us this is important ya there is a meat association because holland you know exporting lots of meat not in word not like in singapore we only have what tourist association hotel association and then what else so he would tell us he would tell us what is important now my goodness tsk hai now in holland in the netherlands you know of course we stay in amsterdam and every morning we've to have to drive two and a half hours up into the the outskirts the pig farms okay now the point i want to make is thi when you're filming when you're filming and there's someone who's with you who knows more about the place you need to talk to that person as you're filming and say this is important ask him why is it important and that's your other research it's while you're doing the the filming you're actually researching in detail now the other thing is of course this is this is an instance where i couldn't i wasn't sent ahead of the crew to do my racking my research etcetra so i have to do it then and there when we are shooting but what happens when you are in singapore is there a reason to do it on as you are going along researching as you uhm film sometimes yes let's say when you want to do a story on nature you know the birds are supposed to be in a forest on the day you racky the birds are all there in fact i counted ten types ten species within an hour i was so ex excited the day i went without christopher hales the guy who the ornithtologist the the day i went with my crew and without him there was no bird to be sighted for one whole morning it's not it's really no joke because uhm they just don't come out on the day i don't know maybe the guys were smoking so the word  birds can read some smoke signals and i was panicking my will woon tye ho understand you know that we were there but there were no birds especially since i sold him the story by telling him that at least ten species you know within half an hour can see ten species okay sold do the story first day of shoot no birds second of sh shoot no birds so what happens so you have to script the unpredictable whatever you have write in a breakdown script okay 
Singapore	okay right quickly please can't wait for all eternity sit okay whistle  sit sit brenda she's sick yan peng sick bay yvonne there you are sorry sorry word  where's the rest of eighty two did the rest of you bring the textbook okay right get word  sit let's start okay before we begin that's brenda lee she's here from the university and she's just taping us please don't go multiple sicion and shut up okay we do need to get on with this alright fine what ah yes well never mind it's it's a bit of unavoided since that's already there okay right we're going to go through much ado and last week we started talking about word  yes yes we did word  we did talk about did we go through it in detail no alright let's start with that because you need to be absolutely sure how this text works now please be highly conscious that this is identical to lear in terms of perceptions you are going to always one of the principles that there is no one view about love that's presented by shakespeare but you're rather going to have ah multiple views presented by the multiple sets of characters now we've identified this now who are the sets of characters who are directly in the issue of love okay beatrice and benedict okay claudio and hero and margaret the announcer word hero ya okay why are you late alright quick okay recap right we're talking about the aspect of love i don't like people sitting behind me i can't see them okay right okay let's get on to this okay now the question of time word  is this that you need figure out what are the kinds of views about love represented in the sets the starting point has always got to be the kind of character love let's try and pick one particular group okay can we start with hero and claudio and remember what we said it's always easy if you have the same like love is something or love is shown to be something like in lear okay we saw that love can be ungrateful okay or we came to understand that people's love cannot be quantified because of the behaviour of lear okay where he attempts to drive cordelia to quantify it you find that it doesn't work love does not always have to be forgiving it can be merciless as well right now do you see word of love in much ado what are the angles let's start with hero and claudio okay that love can be superficial alright word  can somebody pick it up please what do we mean by love can be superficial mean what uh huh okay right okay so that love can be at the top level word  where there is the use of sight okay you see and you respond you may not go beyond that yes that love can be based on ignorance as well right that's an idea that comes across that there is potential where love can be based on ignorance ignorant okay so that will be the example to prove that what else is it what else do we get caught this this object topic of love by shakespeare's presentation you say love is naive okay are you using hero and claudio specifically can you give specific examples yes specific example we're sorting in the text that specifically show themselves to be naive about the concept of love word  and so and what now about the love for them right can we all agree with that anybody have difficulties with that leonard what time is it where were you didn't you get the message alright come on in okay right so you have decided there is naive word love  word because of the fact we don't like judge  word and unlike of what's going on rather you look around and you use information from secondary sources is love fickle is that the same as love being naive prove that love is okay but do you think that word  that in the relationship between hero and claudio you see that love is fickle uh huh but what does he change opinion so what does love become right that's a better way of putting it in this case one sees the double relationship between love and trust okay how is this relation what should be the ideal state okay okay alright let's just word we've got two lines about this one is that hero does sorry hero does the dying bit and claudio registers no emotion so the argument here here is love is fickle or frivolous because it is swayed are you using a different point audrey okay now audrey's point is that he only goes to hero when he wants something and when he doesn't want it or it seems that he's not getting the whole quality of what he should be getting he drops it he picks it up again with it's quite clear she's innocent so there's a frivolity to his attitude towards love it's not treated as a stable thing it's more an imbalance thing where he moves from pole to pole is that the same being fickle alright what is that can we try a better word for fickle or frivolous for this thing that where you say i will love you if you love me back equal proportionately selfish conditional what else love meets your expectations yes a very what merit love has no merit okay where you set a value and if that value is not responded to what do we don't want to word so it's condition okay but ya i'm willing to accept the argument word  that maybe the love here is fickle fickle i'm going to accept that argument and the counter-ar argument going on as well that you know maybe it is because he's so hurt he does these things to hero so therefore his love is true okay point he's word being miserable when she is dead okay now you're all not going to resolve this one so some of you have resolved versus word two polar views about how you're going to look at claudio one of you obviously is not a claudio fan quite clear okay but  word so he's okay please let's not go into those kind of analysis but yes there are multiple responses it's exactly like the lear get used to it the comedy you may think you hate it but word  alright let's go on what other aspects of love can you see with hero and claudio at work try and think about the way they enter this love relationship conventional ya it's a display of conventionality that surrounds love and marriage okay okay can we please explain the conventionality go on to the  word idea ya one claudio woos her by proxy what is already wrong if you woo by proxy yes you aren't understanding somebody else what does that mean about your own understanding if you send somebody else you don't actually understand the person or uh you can't use the word insulting why would it not be correct to use the fact that it'll be insulting to the other person if you woo by proxy right this is the convention at that time that argument is  word  it's the convention of the period that you could do this but given that what does it do to your love relation ya you yourself lack knowledge alright and please remember the issue of knowledge and love word knowledge what you tell me who who said what leonard where where are you leonard if you hide behind the chair okay what knowledge of what each other ya okay so you've got that element to consider as well right elaine had the idea that love here is seen to be rash why rash right there is the word of her naive isn't the way naive is okay fine you got to word to that who wants this everybody you got the argument it's rash and you also have the argument that it is a sign of real love because didn't word  say love him marry him  convention dictates that you shall all the laws lay down their father  so hero displays that conventional kind of behaviour  yet can we ask the question what is the clear proof that their love is rash  what would you use  what evidence in the text indicates  one week  good  that's right  please try and remember it's a comedy because actions get pushed together  there's a willingness on the part of the audience to suspend incredulity  you word you willingly allow time to pass  you must never forget that the theatre works by that method that you have a squashed perception  there's such a thing as stage time against real time  in stage time there's credibility to the action  in real time you stop to think about it it's one week  just like lear gets in to his kingdom divides it gets shut up by one daughter moves on to another and to another  within a month  word you're being tremendously generous there  how many days you think  ya two three days  you're talking about a squashed action and his whole rise and fall  ya exactly word if you word  count it the whole rise and fall can't take more than a week and a half  but this is the same thing word a marriage  we're talking about a marriage between two individuals who never see each other who know nothing about each other except the superficiality and half the time that they spend together before the marriage what kind of state are they  they're never alone  what else  they're masked  word big ball  they're masked  they never see each other  it's almost as if it were a metaphor the way they are themselves they never have knowledge  they all wear a kind of mask  yes uhm yes yes there is an idealization  look for it in your word as well  the same way word idealizes word  word   he sees her as a heroic figure  ya when your ideal so that you have a word of a kind of romantic ideal at work  with this idea of convention love you have a romantization of object of myself which is what claudio has been guilty of  okay everybody is still here and awake  we're not dying yet are we  okay fine  okay do you get an idea what we're doing with this text  it's the same thing with the lear only we're going at a different level word very deeply  two themes  one is love other will be appearance versus reality  okay can we drop hero and claudio for a moment  can we look at beatrice and benedick  i think we've found word almost too dry  alright what about beatrice and benedick  what comes to mind automatically if we're asked to justify the presentation of love by those two characters  love through understanding  i see word eyebrow that seems to indicate that word argument  okay who's going to support love through understanding  okay yes word   what what are they  between the two of them what are they  ya that's right  they are they word uh huh  you you have to find shakespeare  can't tell you that  what do you think  okay the argument here is do they un do they fall in love because of understanding or is understanding something that arises later on  it's there so you think they fall in love with understanding uh huh  so there's you mean there's no choice but to understand uh huh  right so what do you say his love is based on  word anguish language  why  it's a very interesting idea  right you got it  so you  can i modify your statement  you said based on language language is based on communication because they use a tool they are she's got she's got the half of the problem there that that they are the two who talk   even if they fight at least they are talking it's not a case where hero wants nothing but to say 'i shall word ' and claudio does nothing but listen very well to everybody else and not talk to hero right so there's always the use of the proxy now your idea of proxy comes word by using proxy to communicate in the affairs of love there it becomes insulting for an audience to believe okay so you've got to try and draw the line where is conventionality acceptable where isn't it and how can the lack of communication mar a relationship especially in the issue of love okay go on okay so what are you then saying okay right well it's as you can see right on this small subject we're already having multiple views about these characters we're going to try and reconcile these yes we're going and get a part of the problem here are we then saying that they are so similar that they fail to see each other because they can't or are we saying that they are so similar they must see each other what then is your stand for the two of them they're too proud right the issue of pride word  alongside communication somebody brought up the idea of scornful love okay this is where you're going to talk about pride impeding in love alright even though they have knowledge of each other what do they fail to have knowledge of other word they have knowledge of each other what do they fail in themselves right that's where you get it pride impedes 
Singapore	with me tonight are three observers of the political scene mr goh chok tong has asked for the endorsement for his premiership and he says the pap will get their endorsement if it improves on its 1988 percentage by how many percentage points do you think it will have to improve to gain a comfortable margin bilveer ya while dangerous to speculate i think after nomination day results and in view of the lack of general substantive issues ah as i see in this particular election my guess is to get a clear mandate anything between sixty four to sixty eight would be regarded in my view as a clear endorsement thian ser do you share the view it's not a bad number to put into a ball park area in part because the prime minister has said that he wants more open views so once you allow a system where you begin to relax uh the system to allow more people to come in and debate issues there is bound to be uh less of a consensus that we saw a couple of elections back when it was as high as eighty odd percent so somewhere between sixty odd to seventy seventy'll be a very good number i think those are reasonable standards peter well i wouldn't want to box the poor prime minister in with numbers you know because uh i think the the way the campaign is fought you know is more important than longer term it's so easy to say he's got so many more points percentage points so he's got the endorsement he's done better but more important is the people's uh feed uh perception of the confidence level of the government well i was coming to that point as to whether you know there is another measure because he did talk about the people's perception and what do you understand by that peter well i understand well i don't know what i can't be reading his mind but i would say this some people are saying look why so kiasu you know why the suddenness of this election uh and a few other things like that is the gov does the government know something that we don't know is the economy going to go plunging down so i think there's some recovery there you know so it's uh the perception of how confident government is uh how much leeway it gives the opposition uh i don't say backward backwards you know because even in sports you know you you you gain every advantage you can according to the rules of the game if i could just go back to the point that you made as to why this election is being called now why in fact is mr goh going to the election at this point when uh after the 1988 election the pap did say that the win could be interpreted as a mandate for the new team so why in fact is mr goh going for an election now i i think uh because he thinks the conditions are right you know and this is the best time for the best win i think he has put a very strong case that he wants the people to judge him for who he is and his style his national day rally performance was by any observer's view a very good performance and he's trying to establish himself once and for all that this is his cabinet this is his government so i think this campaign hangs on his personality and whether the changes have taken place because we have seen accommodation of uh some of the ? opposition type views into the pap's style of government now at one time it was the the general consensus was that the government is very confident of itself it states its case that's it but now we're getting a position where the pap is sort of saying well we have a position but we're willing to listen to the public we're listen to to to to the voters that's happen in say the ah car policy that's now happening in the area of health cost so i think mr goh says to be judged on his personality and approach it it would be appear to be an important issue here i would agree with clear with things here that the real question is actually political legitimacy i think there is a feeling that he has been given the premiership without the mandate of the people and now he think the timing is right economically politically the ground is sweet that uh this is better than anytime to go to the people because he will have to go to the people either 92 or 93 so judging from that political uh soundness i think he's going to the people for the simple reason of legitimacy nothing more than that well following up from what you say can i say something here? he's already there legitimate because at the last election it was quite clear that year mr lee kuan yew was going to hand over so uhm the mandate is already there uhm i think there's a clear difference in this time zone peter in the sense that since that mandate was given to him he has made several changes more in style if you like more open approach also substance now this is where this is where the measure is being taken and i feel that you know the nomination results are not in his favour because he will he already has a majority would you would you say that the change in policy direction that you talked about is sufficient reason to seek a fresh mandate i think it is sufficient because the change has been happening fairly rapidly and it's time to take a measure of how people are reacting i think the the worries over the economy probably there's some pros in it i mean what's happened in russia is very major is the government concerned about the possible economic downturn i'm not sure they hasn't said that openly but uh many people in the business sector are concerned of possible fears because cost are still rising in the economy and that's a problem and i think in addition to that ah in this country i think what hits the pocket is politically significant and i think there is a perception i mean it may be wrong but at least there's a perception even in the public mind that the economy is taking slowly but surely a flight and politically if you don't hit now and you hit later whether in 92 or 93 i think it can be costly so it's from that perspective that i think the timing factor and its relationship with economic cannot be dismissed if we can come back to mr goh pushing himself as the issue in this election uh is there a risk for him in doing this peter i think uhm it's a big risk but i think being the uh good politician a good leader that he is he is he has organised the environment so that uh it's a it's a risk as a bold move it's a risk but uh minimum risk because uh you know he he's he hasn't talked about opposition type issues uh i agree with thian ser except that i won't call it opposition type issues i i say the concerns of the people you know i think in the past opposition grappled some of those concerns much better than the pap but now the pap has uh has taken the initiative on many of these issues that affect people's feelings and people's aspirations i think one result of a strong victory in this coming general elections would be that the pap is seen to have institutionalized itself because in the past we have the leadership on the prime minister lee very capable very strong and to a certain extent very dogmatic in approach it's nothing wrong in that it give us twenty-five years of success but i think what we are saying now is a new approach and if that's a endorsed strongly by the people then we have seen that most people will accept that the pap is get around for many more years to come and perhaps one good result of that would be that together with that exception uh sorry with that acceptance of the pap as a the ruling party as long as it accepts a wider range of views together with that will be acceptance of opposition pick up from what you're saying about the opposition now the sdp has made a call for this election to be treated as a by-election how far do you see them getting with this i think by virtue of the fact that uh the pap has already had a walk-over victory this effect is likely to be enhanced that makes mr goh's job a lot tougher i think the pap has to campaign much much strongly there are a few uh areas it would appear where candidates who performed well in the last election are standing again so do you see i'm talking about opposition candidates do you see a replay of some of the major contests for example in bukit gombak and eunos possibly possibly i think a lot of people will be watching eunos not that the candidates uh put on either side i think because both sides have put forward interesting candidates and obviously a swing in the grc is very significant in terms of the majority and that will have a real effect i in fact i would differ a bit i think the sdp's strategy is making a virtue out of necessity that's one point of looking at it because i think they will caught but uh on the other hand about the swing i think basically there are four factors which will affect an election outcome one would be i think the people's desire for a pap government which has been achieved there are three other factors i think the type and nature of natural national issues type and nature of local issues and finally they need to signal to the government about what it can do and cannot do i think the the other three will affect the swing and my feeling is at this present time the ground is far more sweeter compared to 88 when there were a lot of sulfurist issues and i think i do not uh share kansas' view that it's going to be a shift so what you're saying is that there are no national issues that's bothering the public at this point i i would think there's no national substantive issue which can fundamentally affect the flavour and uh to that extent i think it's going to work on mr goh's advantage i think mr goh's halo effect is going to play itself down to the local constituencies whereas in the past the local issues were very critical i mean you talk of whether the mp meets the man or not whether that you what what what type of flats you're living in so on and so forth but i think this time now it's different because we are seeing a major political transition a lot of the past issues were in fact related to mr lee and his style this time i think it's mr goh and his style and he's seeking an endorsement i think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for mr goh i've heard people saying i like mr goh i don't like the mp i don't know what to do but i'd rather vote with mr goh than take a gamble you know peter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to eighteen months mr goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition i don't think so because uh you know the uh the uh the the bas the basic strength of the sdp's tactic in saying look let's fight this by-election is still there you know whether whether it's by-election now or by-election one and a half years from now so it's a it's a good move on the sdp and uh it's a it's a very uh compelling argument so we come back to the point of performance of the candidates and the party's performance so government must show must i think make uh recognise that uh one big factor is the fanner's concept that people now have you know and the fact that government has reformed today you know it's going to make that an e even more important factor that you got to appear to be fair i like to take up a point that bilveer raise which is that uh the issues are very different this tim ei think he's right on that score the issues are different but it does not make the election easier precisely because more people in the constituencies will be able to take the view well if we have a few more opposition members in parliament what is so wrong with that uh that's going to be a factor in this coming elections i think the other point that many people will have to consider would what kind of manifestos are the opposition parties coming up with the concept of gracious society is in a way within the pap's manifesto i think unless the opposition is not conscious so are you saying then there really aren't any clear differences between the manifestos of the opposition and the pap bet you pap will disagree with that but i would i would tend to say that the pap have been very successful in hijacking many of the opposition parties' manifestos especially when it come to talking of uh the lower classes talking about the poorer people i think this caring compassionate society has been very successfully uh modelled on by mr goh and it's really i think going to deliver that's one i'm coming to the by-election strategy i think people are confused you know you have not run your ge you're already talking about your by-election that's one i think number two it was mainly to overcome two basic arguments one was the sdp call for treating it as a by-election number two was the j.b.j. problem and the fact that he chose to address it people amy argue that eh ther's something in it you know you just can't dismiss it as a ploy a tactic and i think people are beginning to think seriously about it and that that maybe this is an afterthought rather than really something thought through and that may in fact hurt mr goh in th long run do you see the issues changing over the next ten days of the campaign you know anything can happen from nomination day to polling day but uh that's a a gen a general truth i would argue but uh my sense said i would not feel that fundamental of a change i think there will be basically quite low-key unless the opposition is able to come on with something out of their head but mr goh has draw has drawn the ground rules in the sense by pitting himself as the centre of this arena so it will be about mr goh this time but perhaps uh longer run the worry will be a about mr goh's political role within the neighbourhood in uh asean and so on the opposition parties need to come out more strongly with uh manifestos in respect of where they want singapore go in the future well i think it's not a manifesto bad backward all you know because the positions have have already closed uh closed closed up the the the uh endorsement of of mr goh and uh i think he has a lot of goodwill and a lot of people will vote for him but that would that could be uh negated to some extent by local issues like constituencies and how the uh the candidates uh look because the uh i think singaporeans become more sophisticated now they they do not accept the argument that unless i have a the pap has a bigger mandate in percentage terms is going to be bad for the country so it's not that black and white lah now while though the local issues are important at this particular time in point somehow or another they have been made quite insignificant by the fact that there is a call and the call is where does mr goh stand not just now maybe in the next decade or so i think that's very pressing well the last election was described as a watershed election now if you had to describe this one in just one word what would you say peter we'll start with you turning point legitimacy mr goh's election thank you gentlemen for your views well tomorrow the hustings begin with political rallies and dialogue sessions the campaign will continue for nine days after which you decide who to give your vote to good night 
Singapore	good evening and welcome to points of view it's taken a long time coming but we're finally having an open university it will become a reality by july this year the singapore open university provides a second chance for adults who've missed out on tertiary education they'll now be able to study for a local degree part-time just who are eligible we've been told that those with at least two 'a' levels can apply and others with a certificate in education or diploma from recognised institution here are also eligible the sou is expected to start with two degree programs a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science program both with honours options other programs may be introduced later on many of you may be wondering what an open university is like well britain has had an open university for the last twenty years let's take a look at how their system works the british open university's supposed to serve as a model for ours but peculiarities of the singapore environment will also have to be considered and to discuss just what the open university here should be like i have with me in the studio four panelists mr liew syn paw member of parliament for tanglin and gpc chairman for education dr gwee ee hian long-standing educationist of forty-two years and also executive director of the singapore chinese chambers of commerce and industry dr seet ai mee who've spent three months at the institute of south-east asian studies doing research on an open university and because educational poli policies have always had an impact on employment we have mr george abraham honorary secretary-general of the singapore federation of chambers of commerce and industry to give the employers' perspective also joining us in tonight's discussion are former students of the british open university local graduates and non-graduates as well as professionals well we've what the british open university model is like uh what can the singapore open university be like and what can it do for this society mr liew word you'd like to begin yes i think first of all the open university in singapore can provide our working adults who've missed out on a university degree with a second chance to go back and pursue a degree while working at the same time it will also enable our workers to upgrade and to acquire new knowledge and skills uh so that they can make career switches or changes and it will also meet the needs of those who want to get a degree for self-actualisation or self-fulfilment it will also raise the talent pool in singapore of professional managerial and uh administrative staff and this will make singapore even more competitive in this region in the world and of course lastly it will bring us one step nearer to being the education centre of this region uhm dr gwee as an educationist of such long-standing do you agree with uh mr liew's last point that we could become a centre for education uh yes i would think so i think uh we already have a sub-system of uh higher education i mean we all know it uh lots of people are pursuing uh studies leading to external degrees of london university and uh various twinning programs are also uh operating in the sim and couple of other institutions also i feel that a large number would like to be in the system had it not been for the high cost the relatively high cost of uh reading for a degree therefore the open university meets a really very real need in singapore how open it is you know i think that's the question you see i do not know we can discuss later on correct well i think that is something that we will be discussing in this discussion dr seet what is your research or what do you think an open university could contribute to our society well recently our ministers have been talking about levelling up economically and uh at when i was in the ministry of education i talked about raising the base of the education pyramid i think the open university can do this effectively i don't think you level up by pulling the people at the top the levelling up has to be moving the people at the bottom up to a sec to a to a higher notch and i think this uh open university will be performing this as its major role for society uhm mr abraham what would the employers' point of view be i think the most important factor is that it provides flexibility to a system that is usually seen to be rigid it allows people to learn at their own pace uhm and also for those who have picked up experience in their work it would be a an opportunity for them to relate to work that they are doing to some of the studies that they are doing uhm and i think employers would look upon it positively because if their employees show an interest in bettering themselves i think it speaks for a certain degree of motivation that exists in that individual uhm well let's take the question over to the audience now we have in fact two people jacky and christopher who have been through the british open university system perhaps you could tell us what it did for you jacky what was your experience mrs word what do you think would be some of the social uhm considerations that we have in our environment as far as an open university is concerned well there would be the question of whether people would want to take up a an open university course for self-fulfilment or for the sake of advancing their careers uhm and i think uh there should be room for both uh such students you know word wouldn't matter about their motives as long as they wanted to do the course and who are able to persevere with it i think it would be useful either category of student i personally know of people who are unable to go to university in the fifties and sixties uh because they have to support their families you know the father died or something like that happened and they have the qualifications to enter university and they couldn't and uh in a way these people have always regretted not having a degree and even if they are mature people now in their forties in their fifties i think they would be very happy to go back to studying and in order to you know have at last this kind of uh opportunity to uh enrich their minds so well eddie yeo one of those who's uh taking up a course is that to help your career or is it a a part of continuing education if i could take up the point you made about a possible glut of graduates does the panel see this happening what is the likely impact of this well i think we're still a long way from having a glut of graduates i believe now we've we only have about twelve percent of the each cohort coming out as a graduate and uh i'm quite sure that our economy can take many more graduates than twelve percent of each cohort and our aim in fact is to have twenty percent of uh graduates that's a long word and forty percent polytechnic graduates so i see perhaps this pool of forty percent who might graduate from poly might look for a further degree with the sou after they finish perhaps i don't think there will be a glut you know because if we insist on very high standards uh and uh from our experience we see that so many of our children cannot even or find it very difficult to pass the either the psle 'o' level 'a' level so uh that won't be really a glut unless god has been exceptionally kind to us that we've got so many talented people we always talk about the talent talent pool but i because of that precisely because of that uh i think we got to uh have a fairly good idea of what standard of our open university should be rather than just giving away paper simply because they miss their opportunity once during their lifetime so are you saying then that uhm it should be equivalent to the other traditional universities then yes it's very difficult to say what is equivalent or what is not equivalent but i would certainly like to peg our uh ba or bsc standard to the to our two universities at least i would agree wholeheartedly with doc uh dr gwee on this issue because i feel that it is important that standards be upheld because the university must produce graduates who then can hold their heads high with any other graduate in singapore or overseas and when this is established the future of the singapore open university is established so i think this is an a very important factor but there also have been criticisms that the minimum standards which have already come out of having two 'a' levels are in fact uh rather restrictive i mean are there any members of the audience who have a view on that but doesn't that in a sense uh you know deprive others who probably have a better chance of continuing right through uhm farrod you're one of those who've in fact done all your qualifications part-time while waiting while working uh tell us how much of a strain was it i mean it it was did you feel at times that you wanted to drop out uh i don't because unfortunately because uh i always wanted to go to university and because the consensus i've to work first and that being the case uh i more or less self-motivated to finish the course word  word do but i do find that what you need is discipline discipline discipline and that is really the the the the the ultimatum of uh part-time education zulklifi you have a different point you you believe that standards can in fact be maintained after a person has enrolled rather than at the admission level i think the question of standards at the moment can be quite speculative because it's not uh a question of just the candidates or the question of the support facility they have had at the university the lecturers the whole set-up has got to be uh word to and not only that uhm it depends very much on the first batch of graduates and succeeding ones uh prove that they can uh be uh very useful uh practitioners having gone through university uh having said that standards must be maintained and i think if you talk about having an university that's geared towards people who are already working for example technicians wanting to improve themselves to engineers i think most likely not only they're self-motivated they are already in that field of in that in that area they are better able to understand uh work in a technical area i think that is fine but certainly you you cannot overcome you can't overcome the fear of you know having to maintain the standards tend to agree with the question of standards because we do not want a situation where people end up discriminating against the universities and making the sou into a second-class university because i think the points that have been made is a fact that it's not just a combination of the curriculum but also the people who are doing the program the important thing that we have to understand it is the time frame that is given to these people that is different from the standard university format and so they are able to us that to their advantage then i think if the basic standards are kept the kind of graduates that come out of the sou would be the type that employers would be quite happy to have in their organization  hmh perhaps at this point we can move on to what form the open university uhm should take we've had very bare details so far we know there will be two basic courses in arts in sciences uh but perhaps um dr seet you could tell us you know what your views are on curriculum planning do you think basic degrees in arts and sciences suffice? well traditionally all the open universities throughout the world have had uh situations where they started with target audiences or target groups and the main target group has been primary school teachers who need to update and get degrees so this is essentially what's happening i i believe that's why the ministry of education is offering arts and sciences but in singapore there's a second target group and that is the seventy thousand polytechnic graduates who've graduated over the last twenty years so there is a second group here in singapore compared to the first group so i believe that uh the open university should move into a technology based uh uh teaching at distanced level this uh discussion has also centred mainly on the basic degree uh again traditionally open universities throughout the world have it started with basic degrees and found them that they have a second and very important role and that is of continuing education you cannot have an effective continuing education body without a very strong academic base so it is necessary to almost have a university to have a good continuing education program so as a result we find that the uk ou when they first started they did not look at it as a very important program but within seven years ten years they moved into a very large continuing education program and if you now assess uk ou uh sukotai tamaterak university almost all the open universities in the world you find that uh the undergraduate program consists of about twenty-five to thirty percent of the enrolment of the open university and the majority uh of the students are on continuing education program i feel this is a very important uh factor and i i believe sou will move along this direction because technology goes out of date within five to ten years and one of the grouses of forty to fifty year old uh employees have been that they are redundant sou can and should address this problem of technology redundancy by offering continuing education program well you've talked about the importance on a national level but let's ask somebody in the audience here colin for example you're in insurance do you think continuing education is important? would you go to the sou for continuing education? colin e: as an employer myself i find people come back with basic degree with mbas without experience in the uh technological field and i i can see the danger because the the the the the uh success ladder every round is a degree the additional degree you get the faster you move but there there may be a danger because as you move faster in that round for those who have no experience the matured the experienced people will be overtaken will be sidelined so there is a danger there so i think where that's where the open university should come in here and say okay these are the people to dislodge in in this paper chase let's do something for them so that they can stay in their in in the rat race while going up the ladder so i think that's where the sou come very important here edmund is that true that employers really look at the uh piece of paper before they decide to take someone on 
Singapore	good evening and welcome to points of view tonight we talk about divorce why it's on the rise in singapore and how we can make it less traumatic but first i have someone with me who's been through a divorce rosaline you've been divorced eighteen years that's right could you tell us what were the circumstances which led up to your divorce and i wish i could say many good things about my husband but he was a very violent man i was very much tortured by physical violence and he was an unreasonable man each time i would talk to him uhm i just ended up being beaten up and uh the last straw was when he committed adultery i could not take it any more thank you rosaline well rosaline isn't alone she's one of a growing number of people who are divorced and according to the latest figures ten couples get divorced every day that's twice the number ten years ago a common reason suggested is that more women are working now and their husbands are no longer word so divorce becomes an easy option but is that the main reason for the increasing divorce rate or is the situation more complex than that to discuss this and other issues i have with me an audience of social workers sociologists lawyers and people who are divorced mr kenneth chen mp for hong kah grc is also joining us for the discussion mr chen by the way is happily married with two children but first let's get back uh get back to you rosaline uh uh now at the time of the your divorce were you working now yes i've always been working now had you not been working at the time would it have been as easy for you to go through with the divorce if i had not been working i would have given it a second thought i would do it for the sake of my children even though it would mean that i wouldn't have much quality life uhm as that something that you know if i had to depend on my husband totally then definitely it would have been it wouldn't have been easy to go through this okay uh rosaline has just told us uhm that uh the fact that she was working at the time made it easier for her to go through the divorce mr yeo is that uhm one of the reasons why divorce is on the increase in singapore with more women working today i think it is a bit too naive uh to isolate one factor as contributing to divorce uh i think there are uhm various factors so to just say that it's because a woman have uh economic power that leads to divorce i think that helps them have power in their decision-making because we don't want to cast the woman in a very powerless position word this situation certainly they helps them make a decision so what are the factors then you think today that act uh that has caused this increase in divorce rates i can think of a number of factors uh from my counselling experience with the couples have marital problems and those who are considering divorce i think one obvious factor is a fact that uh marriage as it stands i mean is not a very easy relationship to maintain uh we often take a romantic idea that you know if two persons are happy in marriage then they can live happily ever after i think that is a myth and we must realise that it is not easy to live intimately with another person for a long period of time the other reality i suppose is that when we have any kind of change in society you're bound to have all kinds of pressures on this type of relationship and when people change they have options they have other ways of looking at things then they may also not become very tolerant when they live together and i think that also contributes to a part of the decision-making uh nirmala uh mr yeo mentioned the that people have this romantic view towards marriage and uh sometimes it's not fulfilled this romantic side of view that they have would you agree with that yes to some extent uh again it i i agree with him that uh one can't just look for one single cause but if you look at marriages today it's quite different from marriage as before there is a great deal more stress and strain for husbands and wives because uh previously for example what a woman wants of her husband is to play the breadwinner role and in fact that becomes crucial especially when women do not work there is a heavy material dependence and in a sense when you go out to work the material dependence is lessened it gives women more power and i think that this power that they do derive through working is important because they have the choice of getting out of a bad marriage and i and i firmly support that but with its uh the higher educational level of of women today uh is that a contributing factor to divorce other other other expectations changing as a result of their their higher education i think the expectations are changing because one now looks uh uh for in a marriage one looks for a husband to also share in a marriage i mean their notions of sharing of intimacy with the social intimacy sexual intimacy uh uhm and you must remember that previously when people married the children arrived earlier now with family planning and also we own hdb flats so uh people now uh don't live in extended families any more so the nucleus of relation has become has sort of focused upon more and more upon the husband and wife and they need and there's great deal more demands on each other to deliver certain emotional goods which previously could be delivered through other kinds of relationships uh doc doctor neo yes uhm i would like to add that when we look at the educational level of woman and attribute that to be one of the main reasons for increasing divorce it's misleading because then it assumes that uh don't educate the woman and therefore divorce rate will go down i think education is just one of the means for woman as well as for man to be having a better understanding perhaps about what marriage is but unfortunately uh we don't seem to find that uh many adults when they want to get married they're not sure whether the reasons why they want to get into a marriage situation is very clearly established so it has to do with partly expectations because it goes back to the fact that we don't have the right kind of education and awareness to prepare individuals to have life-long commitment with each other so i i will not you know easily and and over-generalizing this say that it is just a fact that women are more educated now and therefore it leads to you know more divorces i think this is where we tend to over-focus on woman uh and i i increasingly feel that uh the problem could also lie with the fact that we men have not been able to keep up with the progress of women and that adds additional strain to the situation as well you see word   word because they they want equal partnership just not that uh uh husband brings money and that's it the end of the relationship and the men can't take that sometimes you see so ya in a sense i think you want to balance up then we have to also equally uh look at the men and see how they are not able to cope with that kind of a change of expectations so they are they are fixed with their own expectations would you agree that uh people today you think are getting married at uh an age when they are not ready to get married mr chen i don't think this is the problem uh al although statistics shows that the marriage group getting break up break up uh broken up lies quite a lot on the twenty five to thirty five group i think the correct way to assess this is uh by percentage because those who married later uh in re uh in comparison to those who married earlier is much less in number first and uh and those who have married for five years compared to those who have married for ten years the the ten uh those who married for ten year has more resilience to marriage than five years so i think uh i wouldn't place too much notice on uh age as a factor but if we look at the uh the uh demands upon society on individuals uh these days with more and more men and women out working uh do you think they rush into marriage too soon with uh you know what with trying to to uh stabilise their career and the bringing up uh bring up children and uh looking after wife at the same time or a husband mr mr yeo i think that is true when we look at the the divorce rate falling within that age range i think that is a very stressful part of an adult's life you know and if we look at those who are graduates even more so because they've just come into the world of work and then you add that to other expectation from having to try and own a home and try to build your career build your marriage have children we're loading them with a lot of things you know and and i don't know if we if we should not take a careful look at the word  can we slow that down a little bit rather than try and push people but of course then we get another problem you see people then marry later and later we have another set of problem  word you were married in an early age and you're divorced now now how did the how did that affect your uh your marriage your career and your family were you able to reconcile the two word  now you know marriage usually not always it is the man that is more likely to step of line a wee bit out of line whereas it is the woman who is the one who got a repeat and nag and nag perhaps nagging is a too strong a word but will tend to repeat and repeat therefore if the man were to step a bit out of line the woman should pretend that she didn't see it and when the woman nag that man should pretend that he doesn't hear it there you there you are you got a perfect marriage word no i i would i would i would disagree with melvin because in my case uhm i used to try and talk it with my husband and he was beyond talking and uh finally i gave up talking to him because i saw the futility of talking to him and he didn't only step a little bit of out of line he went out of line totally many times he wouldn't come back the times he came back he was a total stranger and then we would have arguments again and there was very one bad incident there that happened that he wanted to hit me and and i was happy because the father the mother the whole family saw what kind of husband i was living with so it's not true what he said you know you stop nagging and the man don't do anything in my husband's case no not nothing was going to stop him so i stop and i i i told myself it's no use talking to him  okay now you were a divorcee you're a divorcee as well uhm can you relate with to uh rosaline's situation word  well not really because i think uh you know for word  and myself it was a very amicable kind of divorce you know and i think uh what we both had in mind really was the welfare of the children it was now how do we un try and get them to cope with this very new situation  word : i think for me i have two very uh wonderful parents who are very supportive an elder sister who is uh you know she's not married but you know she's got all the maternal instincts and by far and large she's the one who uh was the disciplinarian you know when i was trying to work through my own grief word : uh but that lead to the other point you were raising earlier uhm whether uhm it is the age the marrying age uhm people are marrying younger whether that is a contributing factor but i guess it's not just the age it's what is expected out of a person after marriage like can you go on as a person individual going through achieving your ambition can you go through a career or studies for that matter i mean whatever that is important that is contributing factor because if uh individual life stops uh at the point of marriage then really the age is not uh important i guess but expectations of society and ourselves so what what's the secret recipe then for healthy marriage uh mrs hia you've been married uh for quite some time now what's the secret to your success mrs hia: well i think we there are uh several ingredients i can think of i won't say it's just one secret uh not least of all i think uhm it's the fact that we share common values i think uh there is a common reference point some things we would accept as being right and acceptable and others not uh that's one and uh also a commitment to say that we will make it work this is the end there there is no option mr hia would you like to add to your wife's comments mr hia: yes i think i i would agree with what uh my wife has just said i think the other area is is a mutual respect for each other's interests i think uh i think based on the uh what we have said here clearly uhm in the current environment with women working and so on there's clearly a need for greater freedom as it were and the the space that is needed uh women may need more space in terms of keeping a word doing their own thing and and so it has mutual respect that there's a need for space for each other to do their own thing while also there's a need for us to be together from time to time in consolidating the family so the this mutual respect of each other's time and space is very important as well mrs hia: i think  word : i'm sorry we seem to have neglected is the atmosphere because marriage is not just husband and wife alone we have in-laws as well and in some cases in fact in most cases i think interfering in-laws would be a very strong contributing factor to the breakdown of the marriage no matter how hard the couple tries to save a marriage because i've come across cases where both parties are very highly educated both have commitment to each other to have the marriage worked out but filial piety comes in you know the children are put in a very difficult position either to you know to have to save the marriage or to to have the parents mr hia: i think that's where that's where we earlier spoke about marriage counselling i think that is the point of time where these kind of issues get brought up because i think marriage couns uh pre-marital counselling to me is not simply just uh finding out whether you are compatible in terms of you know your income or things like that and perhaps that's that's where the problem word  we're paying too much attention to qualifications and perhaps not enough attention to quality the quality the two people have and you know with proper pre-marital counselling perhaps some of these things can be brought up including potential problems with in-laws 
Singapore	good evening and welcome to points of view for the next few weeks we'll be seeing a lot more performances coming our way this month alone we've had the international cantonese opera festival and theatre carnival on the hill in june it's the festival of arts and groups from all over the world will be coming here so clearly singapore is becoming a vibrant place for the arts but how are the local groups faring just how far can they go and what will it take to ensure this vibrancy continues to discuss this i have with me the local artistes themselves journalists and corporate sponsors let me begin with you ekachai now you work with action theatre and you've been performing on part-time basis and as i understand doing quite well now what are you doing actually to bring in the audience uhm well there's i think there's no secret formula but uhm for action theatre i think the fact that our group comprises a lot of professionals somehow the way we go about uhm doing marketing our product we tend to have uhm i think what we call a twin focus approach i think you need to focus both on the creative side of the business uh and also the business side of marketing the art uhm so i think that that's that's how we begin so far okay so you've been quite successful then uhm but then there are other art uh artistes and performers aren't doing so well mrs bhasker could you tell us some of the problems you're facing now i guess okay the key word here the key issue that we've all been talking so far is marketing now robert uhm you bring in some groups overseas groups into singapore what exactly does marketing entail uhm one has to access the situation first and see what the competition is uhm and then try and gauge a level at which you can sell your tickets at and uh after doing that then you have to embark on a series of very creative things on how to bring the message to the people and i i would say the first thing would be to look within yourselves and find what are the interesting points about the production that would be uhm of interest to the to the audience and the secondly is to to embark on very creative ways on getting that message across it could be it's simply designing t-shirt it could be distributing hand bills but it could also be uh undertaking very uh unlikely and very entertaining ways of publicising the events here there are countless ways of doing that mr austin) so what are the what are the audiences looking for is it more commercial mr austin) sabri well basically from the malay theatre scene we have this uh problem of the direction of arts the old school of thought the old guard believe that they shouldn't be any marketing at all you perform that's your obligation to the society and i i felt this is not wrong but it's not really healthy to the development of arts in the malay community but another another interesting thing that i would like to point out is marketing the arts for singaporean sake i think uh mrs bhaskar was saying that for indian dance only got indian uh audience why can't we do we we devise a marketing stra strategy that can uh pull chinese audience in malay drama or malay audience seeing an indian dance uh we are lacking this uh we don't have the audience but the audience are not educated to appreciate other racial arts you see the the problem become so acute in the sense that we are being expose to western theatre western and the type of education and i guess sad to say that a lot of people appreciate ballet more or a lot of people go to to see opera more even if they don't under understand the language okay sorry to interrupt robert yes yah i think the uhm mountain efforts is not really what i would call project specific marketing effort is a sustain effort for example if you look at the so called quote unquote popularity of foreign shows that are brought in here i think one doesn't realise that the foreign shows that are being brought in have already expended an enormous amount of time and money in promoting themselves before even got here and also whereas we tend i think in singapore to look at it from a project to project basis in the mean time you know between performances between productions we really don't see this effort being maintained you seem just you know when the last curtain fall so that's it's we look forward to the next one not realising in marketing it's a continuous and a total process but who should be responsible for the marketing then i think the organisations themselves should be responsible they must be aware of the fact that as you've mention quite rightly in the beginning they have a product they want to sell the product and they must reach out to the buying public in order to be able to sell the product but mrs bhasker now what is the problem with uh you marketing it yourself marketing your performance  mrs bhasker  sometimes uhm it's very nice for each community to be able to enjoy its own art form but i think especially in a multi-racial society like singapore it's important for us to be able for a chinese to be able to enjoy indian dance or malay dance or uhm you know uh chinese opera and things like that so i think perhaps we should try not only to market it to audiences who are familiar with our type of art but also to a more a wider audience so that it becomes a more cultured society okay how do you go about doing that does that mean you have to make it more accessible do you have to commercialise it to a certain degree i personally believe that uhm this ethnic art should become less purist in attitude they should uhm have more collaboration uhm more experimental in in nature and i think uh in that way uh it can lift itself out of from being a folk art in the way folk dance to art i think that they should uhm market themselves in the way that the uh they should uh ex be more experimental uhm that doesn't mean they are diluting themselves but i think the collaboration should be more on the more established arts like ballet like uh drama like uh cantonese opera cantonese opera it's it has caught on in the drama scene people are trying to stage drama in in cantonese form in opera form and this this will uh raise awareness of uh of the traditional art okay let me ask you winnifred now what is it that okay sponsors are looking for when they decide on what uh group to actually sponsor what do they what do they want i don't claim i can speak for all sponsors i would feel that one of the most important criteria is to see to what extent the contribution of sponsors can go to support that particular artiste or that particular group i don't think sponsorship in the arts uhm should be approach from from the sponsors' point of view that this is a mass market there is no mass market in the arts so once the sponsors realise that they should not go into sponsoring the arts with a marketing perspective that is selling more of their products they should see how far their dollar can go in helping that particular group or that particular artiste to further his talent and his craft but i think that people like shell you know are bombarded with with request for sponsorship all the time and i think as arts groups uh we need to be able to tell the sponsor that sponsor us this is what we can give you in the return i think the times are gone when you have a lot of sponsors who would just throw money and say oh sponsor your art all they need is a logo they need something more right right to to me that would make a lot that would a lot of sense if i were a sponsor i mean i would be looking for uhm a product or a group of people that could actually bring in more audience and promote my you know my own cer my own uh product that's that's not happening with a lot of art groups a lot of art groups are not getting the people in and that's way it's difficult for them to find sponsors well theatreworks is drawing in the audiences but uh if you look at uh i think you cannot just say that uh we'll sponsor you if you bring in the audience i think some sponsorship is developmental in the sense that you know there's no guarantee that there will be a pay-off at the end i think an example is but not all sponsors are as altruistic as that i mean they have personally they have personally uhm yes but sponsors also look at that developmental point of view and uh uh i think that if you just want the guarantee of the audience then it's going to be a bad for the arts of course you know uh sponsors deserve to get the dollar uhm mileage for the dollar to be put in but also there's the other side okay i would say that one of the very important points that has been touched on by tan how when it comes to how sponsors uh assess whether to go in for a sponsorship if our assessment of the potential of it that particular person or that particular group how far do we think he or she or that group can go in their artistic attainment and fulfilment that is very important okay that is a good point good that brings us to the next point now do we actually have that sort of quality do we have enough of those people uh that sponsors are looking for john so there is an overkill are you saying that sponsors should only sponsor the man and not the boys sorry uhm ekachai go ahead i think it has a lot to do more with the quality of the artistic product i think part-time necessary does not necessarily equal amateurish in fact i think in the way our our cultures cultural scene is growing there are a lot of part-time groups that are producing very very quality uh good quality work compared to say product say professional companies professional companies are constraint by the fact that they have to come up with a season there are how many plays the theatres are booked are booked full you know they have to fill the theatre spaces so they have to come up with the plays and num and certain number of production whereas part-time groups can they can be passion driven and they don't need to be you know uh survival driven or profit driven do we need a central body to actually coordinate with when these performances actually come on i don't think so i think in the long-term it's all a learning process for for all of us now i think in the long-term the market will in fact decide how to this thing is going to pan out uhm if we look at the experience of the festival of arts which has been running about for ten twelve years fourteen years now uhm despite the fact that it's only held, once every two years a biennial event it falls very naturally into the june period and the we for example now find that there are other groups who are planning to perform in singapore planning the schedule around the festival  for example i believe moscow circus is coming in again a around the festival time but they are not part of the festival but they lock in very nicely and come in early into the schedule or the festival 
Singapore	 the great marriage debate revisited  good evening and welcome to points of view not enough married people and not enough babies that was the message almost ten years ago what followed became known as the great marriage debate since then a lot has been done to encourage singles to get married i'm sure you've heard of the sdu sds and sps these are specialized groups that have been set up to cater to singles from all walks of life and yet the number of marriages has not increased and even those who are getting married are doing so later and having children later as well tonight we ask why why is this pattern of delayed marriage and parenthood still so widespread even after attempts to change it to discuss this i have with me experts and laymen both single and married mr k shanmugam who's the mp for the sembawang grc is also with us tonight i also have with me two people who typify married people and single people let's start with you terry you're a bachelor and you've got many friends who are also singles why do you think singles are delaying marriage well i'm not sure if i actually typify the actual bachelor so i'll just say this for myself but you find that uhm in many situation they they people are being pushed to excel in their career they want to go places they want to travel they want to get experience in working overseas and things like that don't work very well when you are actually within a marriage when you got uhm a wife and two kids to bring along with you and i think that tends to put people uh to make people want to push marriage further until they've actually gone through that kind of thing weng hee as a married man do you think that his points are valid yes basically i would agree with what terry has said but i'd like to add on and say that singaporeans these days aspire to a standard of living characterized by material comfort and a lot of independence a lot of freedom and as a result they now perceive marriage as an institution which will impose on their financial well-being and on their independence hence uh they'll want to have a good life they want to achieve before they finally settle down is are these points valid 'achievement-oriented people' 'career-minded people' is it all valid well these days actually their education opportunities and work opportunities are much greater i think it's natural when these opportunities are available people tend to marry a bit later firstly they'll finish education much later and then they had have to establish their career so i think it's not uh something we don't expect if marriage is being delayed where did this mindset arise though is it something that we've been brought up to think i think that's that's true because since young we have been conditioned to think that you know we have to go through various stages first you go to say primary school secondary school after that jc university and during that path you're not allowed to think about anything else so the the mindset is is has been conditioned from right from young ya i recall that as a junior college student uhm courtship was frowned upon we were told 'go and complete your studies' uh 'go into national service you'll be more matured uh the the the after having gone through the process of national service go to university study develop a career and then you can uh think about marriage for some reason uh students who actually have steady girlfriends in junior college days are perceived as students who are not serious in their work there's a stigma attached to uh being involved in a relationship in junior college but is this stigma something that we carry with us over into our working lives and into our adulthood i think perhaps it's much more really the structure because both the last two have mentioned really what a macro thing the kind of society we live in that they that the expectations of us are different the opportunities are different i mean in the old days there weren't that many nice things happen to you and getting married was one of the few really nice things now there are so many other nice and exciting things and i think in  word part of the kind of society we live in we see that more and more couples are opting for what i call companionate marriages and so uhm we do have uh people who go through a sort of a childless period and it's as if their life is in a holding pattern you know and then suddenly after many years then there's the arrival of the first child uhm but i think uh the norm is still that most people tend to associate marriage with parenthood well can't companionship like you said be achieved without marriage people can very happily have boyfriends or girlfriends steady relationships and not take a plunge and get married what's the difference well many people might ask that question which is why you find a significant number of of proportion of people uh choosing to stay single and uh choosing to have uh such friendships and without going into whether it's right or wrong or passing any moral judgements we must realize that there's there's such a feeling and uhm such an attitude and deal with that in the larger social context but should we be dealing with attitudes though because some people have considered that social engineering well i think perhaps uh you've got me wrong i i didn't suggest that you try and change such social attitudes well what you're saying well there is a perceived policy a suggestion that we should try and have as many as much well try and increase the number of marriages uh try and have people marry and if possible have children now that's stated as a larger social call but when you try and state that as a social call you must realize that there are significant number of people who will choose not to get married for various reasons economic social personal but in a free society we are entitled to do that and a large group of people who may choose to get married but not have children you must try and understand why they choose to do that and then i don't think it is there's anything wrong in trying to uh win their hearts by reason if you think it's better that they should get married and they should have children right before we of course try and win their hearts we have to look into uh reasons as to why people are still putting it off putting marriage off perhaps we can hear from one of the singles in our group edward well basically a very significant reason is uh financial reason marriage is not a cheap thing these days and i think a lot of people have got very high expectations what uh they expect of the marriage so it means that uh you you find people saving up for house some of them even want a landed property before they get married and uh it may be a bit uh too much of a high expectation but there it goes you know uh people do think that way well i i know a lot of people like to have a mercedes benz but that doesn't stop them from moving about by bus or mrt or even in a less expensive car you know comes down to a question of priorities doesn't it yes that's right are are these expectations uhm realistic well i'm not quite sure that i agree with edward in saying that uh financial considerations play a significant part because in the modern singapore you would find that both marriage partners are probably working so marriage does not per se impose a greater economic burden on either party i think it's more a question of whether people feel materially committed towards marriage and uh these may perhaps be additional factors the economic factors could may perhaps be additional factors but the more important factor is whether people feel that they can be involved in a relationship which is going to demand quite a bit out of them so it's one of attitude a different social value system  word i pick up on the point you made about commitment there are some people who would say well marriage is is too much of a commitment in a sense that it's a mental burden for them is this a fair judgement i think it's rather unfair because if you're not married how can you make a judgement it's too much of a commitment word  but then once you're married it's too late word  wrong well see this see this where perception comes in because the moment you have a pre-conceived idea as to what marriage is about then you may be put off getting married and and that's a concern there that the longer you delay then the less uh uh unfortunate it will be for singapore i'm inclined to believe that singaporeans generally value fidelity in marriage and they also look forward to a happy uh family life for that reason they are afraid to commit lest they may make a wrong decision it is this fear of making a wrong decision uh that actually prevents a lot from really committing to a relationship so you're saying that fear actually cripples some quarters of people is that right for you well fear perhaps might be too strong a word putting it in a context of a modern-day singapore to perhaps fairly ambitious individuals perhaps well-educated trying to live with each other trying to adjust themselves to each other it's not an easy thing to do and and uh perhaps fear might be too strong a word but certainly uhm the uh the it can be described that fact can be described as one of 'well i'm not quite sure that i'm prepared to make that many adjustments at this stage i prefer my freedom to the uh adjustments that i have to make if i commit' is that a selfish attitude though i don't think that is right to characterize that attitude as a selfish attitude because i'm not harming anyone else i'm should should be free to live my life as i wish so there is a very real argument for remaining single after all is that right i think actually word although the older generation are pictured as always encouraging the young to marry sometimes they have contributed to this fear of commitment because many of the older generation of parents kept emphasising to their children how much sacrifice they've made oh how what a burden life had been i'm not sure if that hasn't really contributed to the fear of commitment that people have mentioned even though it's come from a very conservative source not only that i think a lot of uh uh parents who tell their kids you know uh 'if you get married you know be sure you look after your children uh uh i'm not about to look after the kids for you after i've struggled all these years' i think that's not being supportive also because i if if indeed they are trying to promote uh the kids getting married faster then i think you know you might be prepared to also look to the grandchildren uh well speaking as a working grandmother i i i think we just have to face it with uh we will fewer and fewer as we get a higher proportion of grandmothers who've got complete in secondary schooling and the society says it needs everybody's labour contribution i agree the granny's the obvious one but i think we probably got to learn to do without her because society says everybody must you know take part in economic activity  actually i'm wondering if there's a clash there somewhere because when you're talking about uhm the parent giving a negative uhm connotation to the idea of marriage and all that i was thinking sometimes in many cases you don't really have a a a valid pattern to follow in terms of the parent because of the uhm rapid change of uh as word  as word i said progress social progress and economic progress the actual pattern and relationship and lifestyle of my parents don't actually apply anymore to to a uhm double-income family word  career you're saying that are you saying that we're lacking role models yes i think so is that true is that a valid point role-models i think i would tend to agree with with that because i think uhm young couples nowadays are what we call uh pioneers in a brave new world you know and then the old rules don't apply because the older generation always said 'oh we used to have ten a dozen' you know they grow like bean sprouts i mean what's the problem and then you know our generation today with the you know high emphasis on being achievers and and also i think cost of living things are actually are are actually becoming much more expensive and i know that even though when you talk about women having to do a juggling act but the men actually go through an intensifying act because they have to work that much harder they have to stay back in the office that longer hours to earn the extra dollar you know so sometimes when you when you talk about a priority like you want somebody to be career-risked uhm he is going to be so uhm you know hard-driving that he probably won't be able to spend that much time uhm at the homefront so i think we're really asking for a very different creature uh from the kinds of couples that used to get married say twenty thirty years ago 
Singapore	sex yes s e x some people say there's too much sex on the singapore stage too much of a bad thing other say you ain't seen nothing yet there's not enough of the good thing but there are a few critics who go so far to say that the over-indulgence is tainting singapore theatre before we hear our studio guest let's watch a video clip of recent productions so be comfortable and breathe normally i got to check my pulse rate how's yours well was that interesting disgusting or you may be thinking what's the big deal maybe i'll start with you keng sen what's the big deal is there really too much sex on singapore stage well i think that uh i mean i've been looking at the at the clips right and two of the plays were directed by myself that's why that's why we brought you here yah and uhm i suppose i'm more incline to what's the big deal because i feel that uh at this moment singaporean theatre is still exploring you know so it's really of a a virgin i mean we are we are uhm we've been doing singlish in singaporean theatre for the last uh five six years in a very intense way uhm and if we start dictating right now what to write to the playwright i think that we are self-censoring to your word but the question is why exploring just the sexual themes there are so many other things i think that then it must be important enough to the playwrights you see because maybe sexuality is an important concern uh for many young people because they they see that uh as a a as an identity uh as a a a a a a a way in which they can talk about other themes for instance oh let's check with the playwright is that true well i was first of all going to say that i dispute the fact that there's a over-indulgence in of course you're a lawyer right and i feel i can martial some facts to to back it up okay let's have some facts i think that if you really look at the number of plays that had been put up over the past three or four years uhm in the course of which goes you know four or five clips were were chosen and uh presented to you in you know close proximity wow sex sex sex i think in between all of these plays you'll find that there were many other plays perhaps uhm not evoking so much media interest uh which dealt with quite apart from sex the the the point we need to address is not not merely a question of uhm whether we should be self-censoring whether in fact when people take issue with playwrights who write controversial plays then in fact this is a call for more conservatives uh theatre i don't think that is that is the demand of a great many people i think a nude body on stage does does not in itself constitute uhm a sexist gesture i think what what needs to be analysed is is really the question of what use it's made of the body uhm some ways that is where the problem lies you see okay how do we make use of sexual expression i feel that right now most writers are really with because at one stage singaporean writing was not honest and we wanted singaporean writing to be honest so we told the playwright is the honesty is the sex uh equate with honesty it's one part of honesty i think you know okay you agree with that sanjay well i think i think to a very large extent that's true although my concern here is also to want to push push the argument a little further i think there's a complex uhm situation here because on the one hand you have people who are in fact dealing with questions that are very close to their hearts and i think this is valid this is legitimate this is very important in fact but on the other hand i think one of the things that uhm we need to begin to address is also the question of how the question of sex or more importantly sexuality begins to actually move into into into into larger questions largely social questions as well and in in in in some ways for me that is where the challenge of singapore theatre lies sorry sanjay i have to interrupt you here for a short break we get back to you stay tune we'll be back welcome back thank you for staying tune in now let get back to sanjay you were saying uhm i'm thinking also of the the problem in in recent place where the question of censorship becomes a very central problem uhm and it seems to me uhm that you know you have on the one hand a liberal sort of uhm avant-garde uhm artiste uhm our artistic avant-garde against the conservative establishment and you know what happens in this debate is uh you feel the divide uhm i think definitely are you avant-garde there's divide there's divide i don't think there is so much avant-garde but i think that the problem right now is that singaporean society is so reactionary you see i feel i feel that artiste just need to have some leeway to explore to explore issues but as soon as issues are explored there is a big hue and cry and suddenly it explodes in our faces into something which which very soon i think laws and regulations will be created to blunt us this this is my point as well you see my point is also that if or if if there is if the debate is structured in these terms then then it becomes a case where you are you have an either or situation if you are if you are critical of of of sex and the arts then you are necessarily you know pushed into the camp of of the conservatives i think it's important to see uhm that in the long run surely you don't believe that do you no to a very large extent that becomes that becomes how the argument is is structured you see if you are against sex then you are also then you are necessarily a conservative i think it's important to see that you know one has to be against the censorship one has to say that in fact we have to open up other possibilities of discussion while at the same time remaining very clear about the kinds of directions we would like to go towards that the reason that is that is censorship is not the issue you know is there too much sex yes it is it is the issue censorship is very much central it becomes an issue in this word  let me give you an example of this the censors haven't said anything yet it's the it's the audience who parts of the audience who are reacting but you see the word the the interesting uh fact is that uh like lady of soul despite uh a big hue and cry it was sold out and denied and people were flocking to watch it and we had to extend this etceteras etceteras so there is obviously so to me there's there's a a hypocrisy really because there's there's a demand but yet the we get a a big hue and cry about uh uh lady of soul you see i'm glad you brought up the example of the lady of soul ken san i mean i think it's an extremely interesting play but uhm my own feelings about having read the play is is is is basically that uhm the playwright himself found you read the play or you saw the play i read the play unfortunate didn't see the production couldn't get tickets it was sold out uhm but what what is most what is most what is most interesting cliche is it what is most interesting about it was uhm that censorship became the subtext of this play it became an attempt to see how far you could push uhm the limits of was there any objective legitimate not necessarily as the director i think i feel not necessarily as a director but i think that un unfortunately or fortunately the play confronts the censorship head on you see because of uh the issues in it and because of certain uh certain pieces of uh of of writing so definitely the the censorship board had to had to decide whether or not it was going to pass this play and in fact it came back at first uh uh with lots of cuts and subsequently because of the the of the censorship review committee and changes made to the laws uh the play was allowed to be passed so inevitably i think that you within this society because it's so reactionary anything which is uhm out of the norm is immediately questioned through censorship i think this is this is really the point you know i mean the the problem is that playwrights can very often be forced into a position where they feel that you know the issue is censorship the danger with this for me is that freedom the freedom of speech becomes seen as an end in itself this is a problem because censorship is a very important problem but but i think the practitioner has to begin to recognise also that freedom of speech is only a means to an end i think we have to acknowledge here and and and and trust the people who are who are uhm producing this work uhm creating it that uhm except for perhaps french lunatics most of us are interested in saying something interested in reaching our audience and uhm we we have we have things you want to say whether about sex or about uhm other issues where sex is used as al an analogy to to to highlight certain point whatever it is we we have serious things we do want to say and taking that into consideration this is as this i see this as a process of communication between the audience and yourself to sew how how to come up with that balance or the best way to bring a message across yet keep your audience i mean it's not but who's your audience you you talk about people being reactionary isn't that a bit arrogant on your part i didn't use the word reactionary i used the word reactionary so who's your audience who's your audience i think that the that uh the reactionary people are actually the media because because for me so blame it on your the media well the audience came what media isn't here the audience came watched the show and some wrote back saying that we hatred the show and some wrote back and said we loved the show uh but suddenly before we knew it the next week it was blown up into an issue which uh threatened the whole state of theatre in singapore and that threatened the whole state i mean it was described as threatening the state of theatre and uh that was very interesting for me because and in fact in your opening remarks i think you said it threatened to taint singapore word  some people said it was tainting theatre yes that's right but i think you have used along those lines right sanjay no i i i this's precisely what i do not want to say i mean i think it is important to see that the people who who who have problems with the way in which sex is depicted in some plays are not arguing that in fact the moral fabric of this society is being threatened  they are not arguing that we need more censorship what are they arguing they are arguing 
Singapore	and staying with the subject of teenagers there has been concern recently over a particular group of teens those labelled problem kids judging by the figures for juvenile delinquency and a number of young people referred to organisations like teen challenge the problem seems to be growing but to understand what's really happening we need to go beyond the statistics and a statement of a social problem into the world of the troubled teenagers themselves who are they and how can they be helped well i have with me in the studio three social workers who have lots of experience in dealing with these kind of teenagers uhm perhaps to start off would you agree that when we say problem teenagers even though it is a label uhm we are referring to specific group of young people you know those with persistent behaviour problems whose parents don't seem to be able to to cope with with them and uh who if we don't sort of help them they could become juvenile delinquents uh the group that you're mentioning that is only a segment of the whole population of uh teenagers that we need to be aware that inherent aim adolescent development there are certain uh stresses and storms that they have to go through and that require adjustment and coping skills from them but what makes a a a teenager going through normal growing pains become a a so call problem teenager what is that difference i like to see it as a point where the teenager kind of gets to a point where he loses adults supervision whether it be uh the parent as the authority figure or school uh with the teacher of principal and once he loses adult supervision then he will be open to more open to peer influence and that can precipitate uh experimentation that leads to a certain type of behaviour so would you see the the root of the problem may be going back beyond adolescent i mean to the child's uhm early development is that where it starts is it a relationship he has or doesn't have with his parents i think that early childhood experiences do have an effect on the uh teenagers i think uh in present singapore because of the success of our population policy parents see that children are precious resources and therefore they become super-organised or they become too over-protective with their children and so from young they do not allow their children to learn to make choices to make responsible decisions from the for themselves and i feel that if children from young because the decisions they make are normally not that important so if you start from young like learning to choose what kind of clothes i want to wear how much i want to eat what i want to eat i think that will help the children to learn to be independent and to prepare them for self care but what about the group of parents that uhm simply don't have enough time for their children i think parents like it or not they have to spend adequate time with them even if both parents are working which is quite common nowadays so uh the only free time i suppose they have is in the evening and they should try to make most use of it as they can as well as the weekends and uh we word we do find that there are quite a lot of so called problem kids uh be due in large part to the background both parents working the child may be fostered out and the child may have several foster care takers and parents do not spend enough time to build up the relationship with them now you uh actually operate the parentline you actually take calls from parents who think they have problems with their kids right what what do they say to you you know what do they how do they uhm come to you with their problems okay when they come to us with a problem of a teenage uh they are quite a number of common problems for example kids coming back late staying out running away from home smoking or parents may feel that the kids are too young to have a boyfriend or girlfriend uh these are common problems that they will bring up to us uhm so what okay what are the things that you would be concerned about i mean uh kids sort of boy-girl relationships there's part of the normal process of growing up right so what would you be concerned about i think i'm more concerned about the rising trend of abortion and uh promiscuity among the young and also the rising trend of suicide among the teenagers too there are quite a number of other problems stresses from uhm pressures of school work uhm what else okay yah sorry i was i feel that there are are other symptoms that we need to identify i have increasing contact with parents that that indicates that uh the youth begins to show rebellion before they are ten or begin to ask for their freedom uh before their teenage years uh well in advance two three years in advance of their so called teenage years you know so there are some symptoms uh that need to be recognise by the parents early uh and one of them is rebellion in the home the other can be uh low performance uh in school uh grades and of course uh if it comes to the point of misbehaviour in school or truanting or running away from home starting with one night or over the weekend uh to three days to five days these are symptoms of uhm uh problems that are already beginning to arise in the young right i think that's that's a very important what symptoms you know what actually are these teenagers looking for they're obviously crying out for something what do they need usually they're asking for independence but from the parents' point of view uh what they would see as a symptom is the lack of control i can't get my kid to listen to me anymore uh he's too demanding and he gets his own way i would think that that is the major symptom that they need to recognise so parents say they don't have enough control over their kids kids say they don't have enough freedom that's right is there somewhere for them to meet halfway i think they can negotiate because i think the parents need to realise that uh as a children grow older they as they mature they have uh increasing and better skills you them opportunities to take part in decision-making and to let go slowly and once you give them a chance and if they can show that they can responsibility for themselves and also for the family and the society at large and then they can slowly let go but i i think the the the best way is to uh get uhm through whether it be professional assistance of not but i feel that the parents themselves have ability to bridge that gap it has to be both ways where the parents move toward the problem teenager and the teenager uh at least uh understanding their their needs to be some compromise and they have to work towards each other if they're given and yah given that okay uh a teenager who is going through a this kind of phase that's not uh sort of so called normal uhm is not likely to want to listen to his parents anyway or to any authority figure uhm is it really realistic to say that we can help the teenager bridge the gap do you think it's realistic i think yes uh i think teenagers are looking for someone who's willing to listen to what they have to say rather than always have to listen to someone so we need to realise the the the normal transitional experience of a uh transitional stage of a teenager and realise that if someone is identified as on the fringe then more so that young person needs a listening ear and i have found that through my work in teen challenge when the teenager realises that someone is willing to give their time to listen they are ready to pour out uh their dreams their ambitions is not that they want to perform poorly in exams is just that why all the pressure sometimes why i heard one teenager said why should i get straight as you know why must i be like so and so i wanna be myself right so you're saying that really one should not treat problem teens as different from other teenage problems yes in a certain sense i i think the start needs to come from the parents because usually they are the one who recognises the problem first and they can learn how to cope and what like sam says they should be prepared to offer their teens a listening ear and that's where you open up the communication but very often you find that parents are very controlling they're nagging they are demanding and they expect their teens to listen to what they have to say and that's final now that's very interesting because almost one hundred per cent of all the teenagers we deal with uh indicate that they wish their parents won't nag at them you know in some way not uh just by verbal nagging but they wish that their parents would would be more listening than just more understanding ah yah and display understanding rather than just tell them so what you're saying is that the parent should be encouraged uh to take the youth through a process of analysing their problem and then they can act as resource persons exactly yes and it is up to the youth themselves to make the decision as to exactly what solution is acceptable to them and be held responsible for it okay quite often uh you find that uh parents are also too quick to judge uh they will say the friends that you go with are not very suitable and teens having friends they find their friends important and they find them that is good uh so parents need to handle these issues sensitively yah what about okay what about a parent who has never uhm been able to communicate with his or her child has never had the experience of developing that relationship what can that parent do is it i mean is that sort of relationship beyond redemption would you ever say that there are cases which are beyond redemption i don't uh state uh that there's there are cases beyond redemption because i've seen many parents get surprise at themselves uh that they had the ability to actually work toward it may not uh change uh overnight it's again gonna be another process of uh learning uh because suddenly they realise i don't understand my teenage daughter where where was i at all these while uh and uh then if they can look at that as an opportunity to grow with their now teenage daughter uhm then uh it is possible because they can find the resource within themselves okay just very quickly as a final sort of comment from all of you there's this organisation in the states called tough love which helps parents sort of take a stand with their teenagers and stick to it sort of lay down the law as it were uhm do you think something like that could work in singapore ngee uh it's very good approach but i don't think it is suited for our culture because what tough love advocates is a kind of taking a tough stand letting your kid face the consequences and letting your kid go  parents are not ready for that and like wah khoon said their their kid is too precious i feel tough love uh only works on a very strong uh bond in in a relationship there has to be a strong bond because uh some of our teenagers in singapore react at the slighest provocation i think i want to say uh a word on behalf of the parents parents are human beings they have fears and they are afraid that their teenagers would go astray and in the singapore context a lot of the parents are very afraid that their children would neglect their studies and that will mar their future so therefore i feel that teenagers should uhm assure their parents and take constructive step to let their parents know in what way are they taking measures and not to neglect their studies to take care of themselves when they go out or when they're staying overnight so that the parents fears can be allayed 
Singapore	i don't think there has been a let down in fact uh i would disagree with your starting point first of all you must understand that chinese new year rally is not just during chinese new year statistically it it shows in the last fifteen years using discriminate analysis it's actually four weeks before chinese new year and two weeks after and of course as they say there are uh lies damn lies to statistics and in this case it means that the definitions of those uhm weeks are not absolutely precise and if we look just before christmas there was actually a very strong rally from the thirteen hundred level up so in fact we have an early ang pow in this respect well i would start taking uhm or counting my chickens at that point and perhaps start taking some profit i think there is no such thing as a clear precise way of looking at the market though one thing that has been established is what's known as the capricorn effect that during the month of january stock prices have gone up and that's the case here i think the volume has been a lot lower than in previous years and in part we are driven by a lot of uncertainty on the one side and that's the most bullish factor interest rates are down in singapore i think many people are wondering what to do with the money next you know you don't get a real return if you if you leave your money in a deposit with the bank right now internationally the problem is that you know people are waiting for corporate earnings to grow again i think yes it would but i think the problem is this we're in a situation now where the world seems to be entreating rangers the bottom i think has been established we hope to see short of a very major political shock i think so unlikely that there will be a huge drop in markets anywhere in the world what we are having a problem is is establishing how much into our  word  the demand side isn't as good as the fact that cost are dropping therefore by virtue of that earnings in various companies should gradually continue to improve i don't think the market has ignored them again i i must beg to differ you must remember that during this period tokyo has gone on a free fall for sometime and the fact that the singapore market has been able to hold up so very well during this period given the very close correlation between these two indices i think it's indicative of the fact that there is strong buying out there uhm i i totally agree in this instance that there is beginning to have less uh investment opportunities but i disagree in the sense that i see nineteen ninety-one as a transition year between a poor economy to a good economy in ninety-three but a year in which liquidity is going to grow but where the real economy is unable to demand that money and there are basically only three opportunities bonds uhm stocks or commodities or cash i guess will be the other one but uh as we said interest rates are falling as you've gotten your uh uh programme commodities are not particularly looking and that's very speculative and i think there's going to be more and more driving back into the equity markets actually the cautiousness of the market today is i think are considered very bullish factor because when it's when it turns around to become more positive uhm people are going stop buying at present uh levels in the market what we'll see is fair value if you look at historical factors comparing internationally the singapore markets' p e is the same as the us market p e traditionally singapore market p e is rated higher we don't have the problems of the us so obviously what people are expecting is that the us market will really turn out quite strongly after some consolidation if that happens then that will be a kick for the singapore market now which sectors are looking good i think the construction sector which in the previous years has a very rough times is going to look very interesting this time i don't think investors can i think investors have to take a decision whether or not we are in this transition period if they are they should either uhm go in heavily in the blue-chips and expect to ride it up both the ups and the down alternatively they have to trade it the second is a much more speculative approach however if we are right that this year is going to be a vintage year for singapore then it's a question of timing rather than of risk i feel the cursory investor can hatch some of his bet there are around a few shares less than a handful in the market where the yield is actually better than the interest rate today i think if you buy those shares you won't go very far wrong number two i think in malaysia now some shares have dropped so much that they are offering very good two to three year type values if you're looking at that go right it the most conservative investor would keep some or quite a lot of money in some form of bond or cash and keep a small portion for trading in the market and this would be stocks lower-priced stocks and warrants  in my uh speech in parliament that you have referred to i used a very simple example comparing prices twenty years ago word  and i show that in terms of basic commodity basic prices like food the purchasing power of singaporeans has more than able to keep pace uh with the inflation on the other hand in terms of big-ticket items like cars and a nicer home i think the price increase has in fact out-paced uh the purchasing power and increasingly for the younger and better educated singaporeans those affordability of big-ticket items are in fact being used by them to gauge the standard of living they are enjoying in that sense yes well i think the cpi is a very blunt instrument in the sense that it uh collated all the statistical data of some many consumers they are probably one point over million consumer in singapore into one single digit so as such i don't think we can really count on cpi to reflect the actual cost of giving increases for every singaporean well i think uh the cpi is a measure of average change change of prices so uh the the problem of course is the cpi is the most uh obvious indicator of price changes it is not the only uh indictor of price changes there are several others use by economist and so on but yes so far as the cpi is concern uh i think it is worth noting that the individual component which make up the cpi are release by the department of statistics and if we feel that the consumption pattern is somewhat different it is uh quite possible for us to reconstruct our own price-index for instance uh a personal cpi something that would show my own change in the uh my own change in the cost of living personally experience by me uh this has been done for the expatriate community the singapore international chamber of commerce has constructed that so several price indices of several cpi could actually be constructed i think in hong kong they they actually publish a a several cpi three or four types of cpi well there's one that normally that stands out when you compare singapore cpi with say uh cps in the region and that is that although we are much more developed country the way that we get the food is substantially higher than that of say indonesia uh which has about thirty-four per cent rate compared to singapore's forty per cent or malaysia thirty-six per cent gain yes one would expect singapore as a more developed country to have a smaller proportion of its con consumption basket weighted to its food maybe as an explanation for that in amount the amount of cooked food that singaporeans eat but certainly that is one thing that stands out when someone observes the cpi well the point is the cpi is that measure an enriched price level and i think these product changes and all that really come in at the fringes affecting maybe point seven or point eight per cent of of the weights used in the index so i don't think it de detracts from the cpi measuring the average price level i have a point that dr soon mention that in hong kong there are different category of cpi so would you say that in singapore perhaps we can partition the consumer into their income levels and since in singapore most people staying in hdb flats perhaps we can look at the three- room flats and below the four-room five-room and executive and private and construct a cpi well consumption is possible to do that and i think practically is also possible so long as so long as we have the individual components but i think we mustn't lose track of the fact that the cpi is designed to be a measure of average price increases so in that respect if you if you look if you track the movement of the cpi with the gdp deflator which is often used to deflate the gross domestic product to get the real economic growth uh you find that the cpi and the gdp deflator in singapore has been moving fairly closely together in other words they show fairly similar trends the same with uh other price deflators such as personal consumption expenditure price deflator so so as a measure of average change in price the cpi is perhaps a fairly decent indicator but when it comes to an individual or to a particular segment of the population it is not so good because it's quite academic to me that the cpi doesn't go up by by say it goes up by only three per cent but the cost of petrol goes up or the cost of car goes up and i'm in the market for car so that to me maybe what is affecting my own perception of my well-being well the cpi and inflation derived from there is important in wage negotiations it's important in formulating policies so certainly true those mechanisms through wages through policy responses to inflation one could have quite a decisive impact on the economy for instance my people assume that uh uh the government here uses the exchange rate as an instrument to control inflation so whenever inflation show signs of accelerating one assumes that the government will allow the singapore dollar to appreciate and that's going to have an impact on our competitiveness and so on so obviously it can have a major impact on the economy well i think i would i would uh i would along with that i think we we must be quite careful with uh with in an indiscriminate uh criticism of the cpi and say that because the cpi doesn't answer this particular question it doesn't address this particular issue therefore there's something wrong with the cpi because if we talk about economic indicators we can only use indicators which are design for the purpose for which it is uh to design to meet the purpose for which it is design so for instance if we are interested in the problems or the impact on the poor therefore we would go about to construct a price index on the on the changes in the price of various commodities on how they would affect poo uh the the poor the living standard of the poor and so on and so forth  so there there could be a whole range of economic indictors that one could decide so we must be very careful and say that because it doesn't meet its purpose therefore we try to do away with it i have mention earlier perhaps it's better to construct a series of cpis where affecting the different household expenditure patterns and i have been talking using the various household living in the hdb estate as a measure to doing so if we can achieve that i think then general public would have a better acceptance of what the cpi meant to them 
Singapore	okay i think with that we can come to our studio guest suresh i know you're raring to tell us your point of view as well okay as a person who came up with the uh kiasu comic uh books and the kiasu character what is your reaction to the calls so far well first of all there were a couple of us that got together to do the book and i must say that uhm a comic book a kiasu comic book is not a promotion of kiasuism on the contrary it is suppose to make singaporeans more aware of the kiasu behaviours and that was what sort of uh inspired us to do the book in the first place we're in the humour business and we tend to look on the lighter side of things it is fine to say have a anti-kiasu campaign and we would probably support it but being people in the humour business we do it you know by looking at the funny side of it okay agnes is there a down side to this funny side well if they were to look at it the same way as suresh and his co-writer which look at it is uhm looking at humour and that we should learn to laugh at ourselves i think there's nothing wrong with it however you find that uh depending on the maturity of the readers then young children may think that well if that's the way of life in singapore and if it is being uh publicised so why not and on the other hand of course with this uhm capitalisation by commercial firms of using mr kiasu to promote their goods i think it can sort word in a way be blown out of uh view you see but i mean wouldn't wouldn't you say that the use of humour to convey messages even that uhm that are negative in this way that to discourage people from from emulating those that those personality traits it's always been done and i presume you are you are following that tradition yes i think uh people are bombarded with all kinds of messages especially in singapore campaign after campaign telling them what they should do and what they shouldn't do sometimes it would be effective to use humour because a person gets entertained and in the process perhaps some of the messages get through but if you were to tell him that he shouldn't do this and that he gets turned off and we think that we're probably uh more effective in getting the anti-kiasu message across than promoting kiasuism agnes would you say that that is uhm is there a cautionary note to that i'm sure you wouldn't disagree with that by saying how  word we wouldn't well no i wouldn't well as i said before you see you are trying to tell them not to be kiasu but you have no control over how they view it will they be taking it as a lesson yes it's something we shouldn't do or it's something that well it's something that we should emulate so i think we should uh sorry i think we should give credit to young people even children uh sometimes we tend to think that they get easily influenced by comics we all grow up by watching popeye the sailor and we haven't become started speaking like popeye okay okay thank you thank you very much i think with that we've come to the end of this part of the discussion and it's clear that kiasu promotions are meant to allow us to laugh at ourselves at least that's the intention and yes i think we we we need to do more of that but the problem is are we celebrating a behaviour that's not that funny that selfish inconsiderate behaviour well i know you're raring to tell us some of your own personal encounters okay the number to call is six nine one one three double zero that's six nine one one three zero zero just keep dialing that number we want to hear your experiences with the kiasus after this break(phone-in interviews) okay i think with that we will come to our studio guests again the the importance of drawing a distinction between qualities that are obviously bad okay like what we talked about so far and the good qualities like being diligent being hardworking being cautious do you think this is important to make a distinction between the two oh yes as a matter of fact i think that uhm when we first coin the word being kiasu is always very negative in terms of being greedy a selfish grabby so but when we try to link up that with competitiveness in terms of being prepared and being diligent i don't think it should be uhm come under the same term as being kiasu instead as a matter of fact it's a good strategy in terms of being prepared for any kind of challenges and that comes under the same strategies as shun zi ping fa so i think we have to be very distinctive about what we called the kiasuism and what is being called being prepared in terms of some kind of working strategies would would you say that uh some singaporeans are using this as a crutch as it were for lack of better way of putting it for their own inadequacies but blaming other people who are hardworking by calling them kiasu oh yes i would think so because as a matter of fact you find that the people have been using the word kiasu so loosely i would say that we have to think very carefully as what is their definition of kiasu because i think that there could be ten different definitions for kiasu according to what the person wants yah talking about definitions suresh did you take into account this this this point when you came up with the books our understanding of kiasu is someone who wants to win at all cost a person who works hard i'll give you an example perhaps the olympic games carl lewis and ben johnson karl lewis wants to win perhaps he trains twelve hours a day ben johnson also wants to win but he uses an unfair method uses drugs that is a kiasu you know a person who wants to win at all cost even unfair so if people can understand that difference i think a lot of these fears are quite unfounded but do you feel that that difference comes through clearly without being ambiguous in your books in our books uhm uh we make a special effort to show whenever mr kiasu does something uh bad he pays for it you see there's a situation where he tries to beat someone to it to to grab a taxi at the end of which he goes onto a lane gets run over by a taxi that's the kind of situations that we put into the book so you know last comment from agnes a cautionary note very quickly yes oh uh here i think that uh what suresh is doing is is something very positive but i have one word to add and in the sense that uh being kiasu children will learn not just from just the comics alone but from the behaviour of adults that's what i'm very much afraid of because if adults felt that it's it's quite a a fair game to be kiasu the young children because not all of them will read the comics but they will observe the important adults around them and that's my greatest fear words of wisdom really thank you very much thank you suresh thank you agnes thank you well with that comment we can quite comfortably wrap up this discussion i think thank you panelists for joining me in the studio well what can i say looks like we are living in quite a miserable country plagued by selfish inconsiderate kiasus hey but is that really true is kiasuism so rampant a trade that it is the hallmark of the singaporean as suggested by some of us yes we are kiasu and we should do something about it but are not being a little too hard on ourselves sometimes why do we have to swing between we are number one breast beating uh to we are kiasu brow beating come on let's give ourselves more credit we do have our redeeming qualities and we're not really that different from the people in other countries let's not be so kiasu thank you for calling in and remember if it concerns you it concerns us this has been talking point  alright doctor chua you've just heard uhm from a few calls do you think that that's a fair assessment that you know we stereotype people well uhm i'm glad most of the callers justify that there is a mi word a small majority of pe word  employers who are uh abusing their maids but uhm employers most employers are not stereotype neither are maids uh there are good maids there are bad maids so we shall concentrate on the bad maids uhm to stereotype i don't think it's a good uh point for a discussion because sometimes we have to recognise that maids if they are pushed to the wall they have no other way but to uh react the way they do doctor chung do you agree with uhm doctor chua's assessment yes to an extent i feel that the whole issue of uh employer maid relationship is actually quite complex because the word  the relationship between the employer and employee is actually quite different from that of any other work situation when you hire a maid you're actually employing her to undertake house work and child care for example these are actually very broad terms which can cover a wide multitude of tasks for example and therefore word it is difficult to draw parameters as to what exactly constitute the task that should be done so because of this there could be difficulties uh by interpreting what should be the parameters for her job i think additional another point to be made also is that in reference to a call that was made earlier on about how when you pay two fifty then you expect to get that much service out of her it it has got to be realised is and and this is a point that has been made by doctor nirmala purushotam who is research on the subject now actually what is happening when you employ your maid is that you actually moving from house work that was done for free by the woman of the house that is the wife and the mother to now uhm work that you have to pay for in other words you're actually paying two hundred and fifty dollars and and more because if if you take in consideration board and lodgings where previously it was serviced without a fee doctor chua do you think why do you think that kind of mentality arises i mean as a psychologist about uh employers abusing their maids no about the fact that because we pay a certain amount of money we expect this kind of uhm service that uhm there is a possibility uh possible uh explanation what we re generally referred to as transference uh theory whereby most employers they're working in a working environment as an employees employers who are generally bad to them generally they like to take this uh phenomena back home and transfer it to the employees which is their maid uh but uh we have to recognise that employers work in a different environment maids work in another environment the maids are most subservient to them rather than employee uhm employers themselves who are employees in the work place so it's usually a transference phenomena here  uhm alright thank you well we've just heard some different reasons as to why employers behave the way they do do you agree we'll also like to hear how you think we can deal with all this we're going for a break now when we come back your responses 
Singapore	hi i'm peter lim the sea games are almost here and no prizes for guessing the topic of tonight's discussion the making of champions we invited two people who are truly good sports their personalities who would take us back to the sixties race us to through the seventies and the eighties and get us talking about the nineties about living and winning in the fast lane meet pat chan hi pat hi peter who won thirty-nine gold medals in five seap games and now you're general manager and creative director of a publishing company that's right fast lane still well i word that publishing is still in the fast lane fast meet c kunalan call you kuna yes peter welcome to the studio thank you and you are the uh bullet man ten point three seconds you did that in singapore you did again in mexico at the olympic games nineteen sixty-eight was it sixty-eight yes you're now uh deputy-head coach of the uh male sprint team for the sea games and you're also instructor or lecturer at the college of physical education school of physical education thanks for updating me well pat uh you started when you were eleven can you still yourself in your uh mine's eye diving in and swimming across i can i remember bits and pieces of it i sound like i'm as old as the hills no i remember bit uh bits and pieces not uh not a lot because i think even then uhm it seemed like a lot to do how to recollect right it's hard to it so let me help you tonight okay okay we got some footage from our archives  footage  well pat wasn't that somebody else didn't you look great then i don't know you still look great now i don't remember looking like that can mum swim now mum uh my mother can always swim she've always been able swim she've always been able to swim oh i thought the commentator said she she's the only one in the family who couldn't swim oh they they say all kinds of things is that so ah ha kuna will you be surprise to know we have film of you when you're eleven years old too no i think when i was eleven there was no tv then really okay well maybe i got it i was ten years off okay watch this alohah kuna thirty-six years old tak kachi chance you were beating those youngsters yah do you feel great after that yes i i suppose i felt uh i felt good about uhm doing those kind of things did you feel bad walloping those youngsters uh no no no no i i uh no i never went out to wallop anybody ya i it was always uhm uh good feeling to be able to uh run with them uhm and and feel that hey i can still keep up with them that kind of feeling you were not keeping up with them you were way ahead we would like to talk about some secrets tonight so can tell about tell us about your re regime oh we uh because it was i guess as uhm exploratory as pioneering as it was uh we were doing crazy things like uhm well at the time we were living half a mile from the chinese swimming club and we were scaling the walls at five o'clock in the morning when it was pitch dark didn't they didn't open the gate for you they didn't understand what that meant i don't think even then i really did but it was fun scale the wall so you were trespassing were you we weren't trespassing nobody said anything they just thought well there goes those there goes those chans they're all crazy bunch that's part of the warm part of the warm-up right part of the warm-up part of the fun i think as children i think it if it haven't been that kind of adventure as well uhm it you know it's like not knowing what's coming round the corner will you do it again would i do it again not at my age no okay but i'd do it probably do it again uhm with a lot better technology we didn't really understand half the things we were doing you know we were just doing it because we loved it uhm because it's it's a very nice feeling to wake up in the morning you know if you're the only one doing this because you're half crazy nice feeling okay nice feeling i mean i think you have to be slightly different breed i take your word for it kuna at twenty-one you know you have to train as hard for the for the sprints yes you didn't have to scale walls right uhm no we i think we had to scale some fences and hills because you did wow full of trespassers on uh on uh on the weekends and public holidays the the track would be closed and the there were several occasions when we had uhm i think have words with the watchman but we we we got got by you two had very different experiences uh you started very young you started uh much later uh what's the ideal age to start well track and field they have to start uh being active from young how young uh maybe even from twelve onwards so there is a systematic development in their youth and then as they get into their late teens they can start uhm being a bit more serious about the training and then when they are in their twenties then they're they are prepared to train hard is there a a over the hill age at i think maybe at one time we we thought wasn't enough over the hill age but uhm i think some world class athletes are showing that it's not true carl lewis is already thirty and he he's he he still runs uh twenty seconds for the two hundred metres which is you know fantastic a lot of sport is mind over matter uhm i think in in the last sort of twenty years people have discovered that uh the winners have it in their mind to win anyway the the the power of the psyche over the body is something that uhm i think it's just has been really not been uh uhm utilised so you must have the will right what about the talent i think like kuna and and myself we were in in different ways spotted uhm i think you need to be recognised you you may want to do something very desperately may want to be a top ballet dancer for example uhm and if you don't have the aptitude then it's very difficult well that's a good point i like to come back to this point after the commercial break how to get talent spotted it may do me some good to know that yes it's time for a short break we'll be back before the break pat chan was telling us about the need for internal drive to become champions the need for talent and also the need to be talent spotted pat how does one get talent spotted there's one of those one of those things of uh being the right place at the right time most of time uh but to get talent spotted you also have to have a a a real group talent scouts people are looking for talent and maybe the trouble in singapore is that there aren't they that many people looking out no i think this is where the school teachers come in isn't it uh because i think the the physical education teachers are better trained uhm and so they are in good position to uh spot talent are they doing it uh yes i think they are doing it but i think much of our talent is being wasted why uhm talking about the system yes in what way you need you need a very systematic development of these youths uh but we are losing them at a very early age we are losing them at 'o' levels 'a' levels and then we're losing them at very crucial stages maybe at when the boys go to ns and when uh they also go to university we're not talent spotting either at at those crucial stages because if we can pull them out i'm not saying yes i'm not saying special privileges but i'm saying that if you recognise somebody has the potential they should be pulled out and put into special programmes otherwise you will never get the champions uh we could be sitting here twenty years from now and still be discussing these things so what can we do about it in singapore we cannot run away uh from the fact that they must get these uh academic qualifications or uh or uh or career uh qualifications uhm because we are such a small country we the the the society cannot absorb people uh ex-champions and put them in in vienna desk they have to have some kind of qualifications no they word they don't necessarily have to get those qualifications in the fields that we are accustomed to they can be sent out to get uh uh you know either in sports medicine or sport psychology or whatever it is and then we bring them back as specialists and this is something we haven't done they haven't had bursaries or scholarships to do that but uh of course now we have uh the bursaries and scholarships uh i think in our time uh they were very far and few in between but now there are uhm monies available scholarships are are available and it the ball is now at the sportsmen's feet are you sure of that but yah i'm i'm quite sure of that in the last how long have they had these things i mean how long have they have these bursaries and why haven't we seen real results i i think the last three or four years at the most but so you're saying that this is very in word  at the moment yes but yah it and so it is the the sportsmen now have to make a choice uh uhm should i go on a scholarship uh what are the obligations ah if i go on a overseas scholarship uh do i concentrate on my training for sports or do i concentrate on my university education but you can do both can't you you can slow down your academic training maybe take longer to get a degree you maintain your your sporting we we could that but if you're on a scholarship the expectations are a we send you for three years you do it in three years and come back please can't we stretch out the scholarship already we we should do that but then uh uh money is involved but uh maybe we can work out something like that but we can't do that kind of stretching out in in the local scene why not why not i mean that's university uh uh policy isn't it now if if the course is three years you do it in three years you can't stretch it out well this comes back to what i was saying okay so maybe uh uh that's something that you know uh our tertiary institutions can think about but i mean this this is the question uh do we have champions of any real real standard very few and far between the uh i mean the answer is there if you want to uh you can make concession for these people you have to everyone has to i'm not saying that they're concessions but it's just being able to think a different way  it's not a concession i don't think any athlete wants to be thought of as a concession yes i i agree with you pat yes uhm uhm maybe in certain areas we need some government uh uh intervention maybe in the area of national service uh some kind of arrangement has to be made there but there are many other areas where we can get uhm help and support name a few for examp for example i i said we are losing them at their 'o' levels 'a' levels why parents want their their children to do well in the 'o's and 'a's the the school can help them in that area 
Singapore	hi i'm peter lim and it's mother's day hi mom and all the other mothers out there happy mother's day it's a happy coincidence that we're discussing men tonight after all all men come from women men come in various guises there's a gentleman the new man and remember the old brute then there are those confuse guys who make the girls feel so sorry for them so what's it really like to be a man in singapore today take me for example am i the typical male are you the model man and if you're a woman what is it take you expect of your man the ideal man to help us define or redefine the singapore man i have a fair distribution in the studio tonight one woman and two man let's get to know them hi janice it's good to see you again thanks we used to work together yes janice you are a journalist a wife and mother so i put it in the right order yes i think so no well mother first right absolutely and you are the columnist too doctor robert balhetchet can i call you bob yes certainly please do you're a mor moral educationalist and like me a bachelor oh sorry i didn't realise i had company i've company too and anthony you are a family therapist husband and a father welcome to the studio tonight we're talking about men singapore men and what society and women and men themselves expect of the singapore male so can i start with you you must be expect on the men well i hope not well janice you took a year's leave from work to look after your son ryan who is now three three years old right almost three but why did you take twelve months away from work why not your husband a simplistic answer would be i suppose that's because i'm his mother and that's expected of me but uhm i truly do feel that it is the woman's role to be the mother and as much as my husband loves our son and everything i think women do give uhm women were meant to be mothers and there's a nurturing quality to women that perhaps uh i hope i don't get into trouble but perhaps doesn't come as naturally to a man anthony are you reassured to hear that i am not you're not ya because one of the problems is that we sometimes do not let the man become a human being to allow that nurturing part of him to surface i think a man can also express this gentleness nurturing spirits and so on let's let's try and get into the minds of some of the uh male viewers tonight but how many do you think will agree with what anthony said uh maybe not too many i've often said i'm not too sure whether it's process or socialisation i tend to think it is but i don't think too many men would uh for instance uh cry readily in public or in front of someone else wouldn't mind if i cry in private well i own up but the whole what's the point of crying in i mean ya but uh you know out of sheer sorrow for instance let's say they they lost their wife or lost their mother they cry out of sheer grief you know uh but they jolly well make sure that nobody's around to see that because they'd feel that that that's being soft you know uhm i think that's the mentality of most men and believe me they're probably brought up like that i don't blame the men so you blame the mothers do you i think so in a sense because uh you you you see this with with every mother if a kid falls down and uh if it happens to your boy and he yells and cries the mother picks him up and say come on you're a big boy boys don't cry oh that that is being told to the chap from very young if a girl falls down and cry then no problem sayang the chap you know it's it's it's kind of natural you know i remember being told that many many times when i was a little kid boys don't cry you're a big boy now you don't cry so you know you you you grow with the mentality i mustn't cry and i agree with bob here you see there's a reality that we define men in a certain way women in a certain way and in that sense we limit the men they say in my therapy room we find men having that privacy that uh permissional most you know to express their emotions when in pain due to they do or they don't they do they do due to difficulties in life or or problem with relationship and i see a lot of man crying you know ice-sin:s1b-031#> so it's it's like so sad you know that you you you have to pay somebody for an opportunity to cry i mean wouldn't he be better if he brought up to to to be permitted to express emotions and perhaps express them appropriately too so that we do not get some men who have difficulty expressing emotions and then they end up with a lot of aggressive feelings and some of them then end up beating up their wives or hammering things or killing themselves or you know bestrewn things altogether i think i they be allowed to to get in touch with this part of themselves society now says singapore at least that men must change right and the the then prime minister in uh july 1990 says that uh new attitudes have to change if singapore women are to successfully juggle their roles at home and at work so society is demanding that bob are the men responding or are they getting more confused or more reactionary uhm i guess it's a bit difficult to answer that outright in terms of uh equality lie for instance equal pay and treatment and that sort of thing everything else being equal uh then i think you know that's that that much change i suppose if it adds to a large extent but there must be some areas which are you know there is still that kind of a differentiation but on the other hand uhm i would think it'd be totally unnecessary i wouldn't want men to change uh in terms of uh the niceties that he shows to a to a lady etceteras etceteras etceteras you know uhm i've been accused of being male chauvinist because i open doors for ladies uhm because it seems that's an indication that i consider the other sex weak i don't know weaker and they can't open their own doors so do you still do it absolutely and i think will absolutely defend and when i teach courtesy to to kids that i teach them to do it uhm because i think it's nice i've been told to stop doing it sorry i've been told to stop doing it yes so have i i was told that in public in in a discussion once you know that i was being chauvinist i said what carry on but i like being chauvinist and somehow or rather the female friends i mix with seem to like my chauvinism in that area at least you know janice which is how i feel actually men are quite confused you know uhm on the one hand they're expected to now be sensitive and emotional and those are very good i mean those are the things that keep a relationship alive at the same time the woman also i think i think if if if i can be used as an example i'm just your average woman right we also want the men to remain protective we also want the maleness you know of the men to come through so while i want him to learn to share his emotions with me to learn to to to nurturing and everything uhm i think i also have a responsibility to in teaching him how to bring it out because you can't just say the man has to change full stop and i am a woman and i demand this i know i depend on my husband for all the practical things in life uhm he depends on me for the emotional support that i can give you know so it's it's a partnership lah you know i i come to think in the sense it's sad lah you know i don't think we should just focus on men's changing you know because men has to change in relation to something and it's in realism to the changing expectations of women as well of word even other men so i i agree with you in that sense i mean it has to be something mutual and i also agree that there is this confusion that is setting because with all the demands of men to change sometimes the man is not quite sure as to what he ought to be you see at the end of the day and that may add to the confusion i suppose but do you personally feel confused do you or do you what you should be i suppose i suppose that there's some point you can be because then you ask yourself what do they want you see so you're you're told for example okay you you you you must let the woman be more than that you know passive uh submissive person so you let her be okay but then the next moment you stand back and you refuse to open the door for her for example and then she just much in then then you get the snag remark that you don't want to wait for me first you know open the door i think there's a different issue between chauvinism and gallantry there's some confusion i'm i'm just it's a maybe a silly minor example but but there's a bit of confusion there so likewise with other areas to in just with what janice is saying you know what we're talking about letting the men express emotions some women cannot handle that because the moment you see that coming out from the man you think he's being less than a man when like i said before you said it's actually being more human you see so that may lead to the confusion well we talked about uh different demands on men which are causing confusion among men and you you of all people i'm surprise to hear that you too are a bit confused uh you mentioned maleness and after the break i'll like to ask you to elaborate on that it's time for a commercial break we'll be back before the break we are talking about how confused we poor men are bob and i have two things in common at least we're both bachelors and both of us have been scolded by women for opening car doors and other doors for them anthony in the other hand have has seen men being scolded for not opening doors for women so janice what do you women want i don't know uhm i think women want a balance and i think there's a difference between chauvinism and just plain politeness or gallantry old world chunk and i think if you if women want to bring it down to something as ridiculous as don't open the door for me because i'm macho enough to open my own door then it's i think bringing things to the extreme but there are different there're women with different attitudes right ya so you represent the middle ground middle ground i enjoy being a woman okay  but that doesn't mean i enjoy being trampled on by the men there are certain roles i think of the men has to play just as there are certain roles that a woman plays is just you know it's just the way of the world right and which is not so that if he cries he's being less of a man but there are certain things a certain take chargeness uhm a woman i think must feel that she can depend on her man you know not to fall to pieces in a crisis to be able to make decisions for the family if they cannot reach some somebody has to you know to to to be a leader to be to be the person that you can depend on he is the person that uhm there's certain male attributes that he should have lah you know is it that's that's not necessary that's not necessary being male you know i think i think it is and apart from that is it unfair burden to the poor guy precisely precisely you see so why should the man be burdened with all these responsibilities because the wife has to take care of the running of the household so that word him to but the man the man the man the man is also changing and and why can't the man uh woman be the provider as well so that the man can make a change too he can do other things that he wants to because if you do not allow the man to do that then you get to a position where the woman have choices you see she can decide that this is what i like to do i like to be a full-time mother i like to be part-time mother i like to be full-time worker outside i like to do this or that but the man has no choice virtually he has all the responsibilities of being the provider the decision-maker the take charge person you know word can't even out no no no i'm saying when it comes to the crunch you know somebody must why can't it be the woman if the woman can make up her mind sure you why why not i mean as a man i'll like the woman to do that too so that in a sense we then you know allow for this interchangibility because i these are not necessary static roles you see i mean and they can be flexible and there can be interchangibility between the man and the woman  
Singapore	i think it's true that uh in the market there is general perception that the prices may begin to to move down and the i think this perception is uh due to too many expectations one is that there seems to be coming on-stream over supply of uh residential property and secondly there seems to be a consensus that the economy may be weakening my own opinion is that uh the market will probably be stable for at least a few more months after which uh it may begin to ease but not very much martin  perhaps uh five per cent which is what i said before uh well i think uhm basically uhm everybody is now on the side lines waiting and personally i think the property market is really toppish because i think uh if you look between 1985 and now the prices have gone up probably close to three times so the i i believe the upside potential is limited and i think the prices should come down as uh dr amos said five to ten per cent well uhm from historical record in fact we have seen that the rate of increase in prices have started to drop since about end of 89 so even though there is an increase over all these months the rate of increase has been dropping so that seem to suggest that we are also heading also for downward uh uh movement of the price  martin  i think well it's anybody's guess it could be five it could be ten well i have a different opinion from all the other three uh we are more bullish uhm having crunched our numbers we realise that yes prices have gone up considerably since 1985 or 86 but then at the same time so has uhm income of singaporeans uhm so the actual affordability has actually improved uhm the other factors to consider would be the fall in interest rates here against that you've got relatively higher yield on rental of say condominium apartments and there's also foreign factor you've mentioned hong kongers but uh i think there's another factor to consider which is the shortage of local professionals in the work force here which means that there'll be a continued strong influx of expatriates to meet that short fall  martin  yes i'm bullish  martin  i think prices will remain at current levels for say another four to six months and there after people will start to come back again because the longer prospective buyers prospective cash-up buyers wait the more anxious they are about possibly missing the bottom of the market  martin  yes i think he is very optimistic uhm basically he mentioned about the increase in income well uh i think if you look at the increase in income versus the increase in property prices over the last five years uhm you know as i mentioned property prices have gone up by more than three times but certainty income didn't go up in terms of in that proportion so uhm uhm i think he is pretty optimistic well but the other factor to consider is capital gains from those who are now in public housing if you have bought a say five-room hdb flat five years ago at around five years ago at around hundred thousand dollars today you could sell it for easily two hundred thousand dollars so with that and the uh increase in income in salaries since then most couples should be able let's say a significant number of uh household in public housing would be able to upgrade to private  martin  uh i think i have to to step back a bit ice-sin:s1b-032#> uh assuming that we are at the peak it doesn't mean that the this is not the a good time to buy uh generally speaking prices are expected to move down uh later part of the year but uh assuming that you are careful in your choice of property uh if you buy at the peak a very good quality property in a good location uhm from historical trends we have seen that actually although the property market moves in cycles uh every cycle is higher than the than the previous and if you buy at the peak and you are willing to have a longer term investment horizon to hold on uh to say around the next peak uh in fact historically we have found that the rate of growth for capital appreciation has been quite good you have six seven per cent  martin  we are basing uh our projections mainly on the possible supply situation in fact we agree with yew boon that the demand is strong but the price being quite high tends to dampen demand because uh it acts as a ceiling from people's perception but uh supply is still a very fundamental uh component uh of of of factor of price and looking at uhm landed property as compared with condominiums the supply for condominium would be we estimate for the next two or three years about thirty per cent or above say thirty to forty per cent over supply compared to landed property of about fifteen to thirty per cent so looking at this just from the supply point of view there seems to be uh perhaps a greater amount of oversupply for apartments and therefore there maybe a greater down side for apartments compared to landed property martin  uhm well now it's it's uh let's let's look at the question from the point of view of uh uh growth right uh i was saying that the the the long-term trend is one of a growth in the property prices so if you if you are willing to hold long-term then you could say that even at the the peak it is not the wrong time to buy provided you are very careful in choosing good quality property alright on the other hand you say let's let's wait until it slides ten fifteen or even twenty per cent or let me wait wait until the market is down but we know generally that it is when the market is high that you do get people selling good property in good locality this which are perhaps with uh well secured tenants and if you wait for say the bottom of the market now you may be scrapping the bottom barrel  martin  well uhm i would say it depends on the type of properties that you are looking at certainly i think apartments you know i feel that uhm there is a potential that it may come down so uhm if you have a pro just now you were mentioning about the the guy wanting to buy the property when to buy and when not to buy it really depends on your time horizon as as uh dr amos said you know the other thing is uhm in terms of upgrading if you're buying it for your own owner occupation then you know the timing is less important because if you were to wait for the down turn you know you maybe never be able to get the property that you like so it really depends on your own personal what you think and the other thing that is very important is your cash flow you know whether your monthly income is able to service the kind of properties that you are buying at  martin  yah i think so  martin  for investment meaning that you want to buy to let out at the same time perhaps in a few year's time to sell for capital gain uh for budget say uhm hdb homeowner possibly if you have budget of say four hundred to five hundred thousand you'll be good to look at uh preferably uh prime districts which we we know nine ten eleven and in fact perhaps fifteen too because these are the areas which are preferred by expatriate management uh staff who require housing and they uh go for these areas and the rentals that you can get probably would would be quite like seven per cent yield uh advertisement at ten per cent yield seems to be really too perhaps exaggerated  martin  outside prime if you think for investment uh well uhm you may get a yield of six per cent which is not bad uhm but the there is perhaps a a little more difficulty in letting out i think if we look at the uh figures you would see that prices are actually becoming quite uh similar in various district outside the prime area and this trend will go on as the uh island decentralised in its development pattern so in a sense there's really a wide range of districts and areas to buy into what is probably more important for mr lim would be to uh make a very careful assessment of his personal needs the needs of the households perhaps accessibility to uh places or place of work uh the schools uh schools for the children and so on so that would be more important  martin  well certainly for investments we look at two things one is the rental and one you know is the capital appreciation well uhm i think in terms of investments if you are buying a property for investments location is very important uhm location is the important thing that you should be looking at because in terms of appreciation when the market goes up they are the ones to go up fastest and when the when the market they are the the ones to come down fastest and in terms of rentals i think you can get much better rentals and much better sup uh demand by the expatriates so i would say that if you are buying a property for investments you should look for prime location uh res uhm apartments  martin  yes i think so because if you are buying houses let's say for example in this particular person he's he's living in hdb he could opt for a terrace for example because i think like a terrace or semi-detached the prices have gone up much less than would the uh the condos uh in terms of the price increase i think the the uhm the landed properties have gone up probably about thirty to fifty per cent compared to condos which have gone up about three times so i think in terms of the potential for capital appreciation certainly i think landed property is a better bet but again you know it depends on your own personal preference  martin  i think until the uhm government particular the cpf changes its uh regulations uh the leasehold property would be a safer bet because uhm sorry freehold property i guess uh you know leasehold property uh i think after ten or or twenty years up to close to twenty years the property uh the capital appreciation potential isn't quite there but i think there is a psychological factor at at work because i think we still very much like to own a piece of the turf in singapore and if you look at the new uh supply coming onto the market that is in private housing than we have almost two-third of it in the form of uh medium price terrace houses but that obviously uh tells you that both the public sector as well as the pri pri private sector is targeting that particular segment of the market well i think if you have half a million you can easily buy in a terrace in a uhm not so prime location uhm and uh i think you can also you can also buy a small apartment if you want to so uhm there is still market if you have a half million there is still a supply of such properties in the market  martin  the only the the the only i think uhm semi-detached have gone beyond half a million except for really off-side locations or very old properties so i think it is really beyond the reach if you have half a million for semi-detached  martin well uhm we look at properties quite differently from the real-estate valuers because uhm we look we we deal a lot with customers so we know roughly the transactions that are going around we also look at what we think the uh longer term uh market is so taking things into considerations most of the time we would have taken the purchase and said that uh compared to say you know transactions that were going around in the last uh two three days or two three months and we would feel we would know that whether that is a good price or not 
Singapore	i think we should not start with by comparing with far larger countries with with far greater resources it's always a matter at the end of whether you finally make the profit so these are the first steps and of course there will be failures there are going to be many more failures but we should not be deterred by it but i was going to come back to mr onmae's point that uh we should concentrate on services which of course i think is an area that we should be in fact uh focus on but i do dispute the point that in manufacturing industry we are not competitive in all manufacturing industries if you if you try to uh examine various facets of it there are areas in which singapore will be competitive martin  i think selling out is not the uh right point here i think it's getting yourself a mesh or getting yourself a a group into a bigger base to go into the global market because going global is uh not something that simple as uh what uh kent said earlier that singapore can put itself uh together with the whole region as the capital city but the problem here is we have still this border despite what we talk about the borderless world nations are still nations so there are still barriers but the day might might come as we talk about the free trade uh area where singapore could actually be the capital and as what wee hock said earlier the infrastructure and all the pluses that we have could be made use of uh to our benefit so for singapore companies when we team up with larger uh companies or when you seek the path of a a listing for instance to get more capital is to equip ourselves for globalisation so when you companies uh teaming up or uh selling out to bigger uh group is because of the products that they have that they are ready to globalise and you need to take that path  martin  yah i i i tend to agree with dr onmae that you know there is a need to emphasize the other aspects rather than pure manufacturing if you look at singapore's history where have been good where have we been strong we are good traders we are good builders of domestic we have built a very good lifestyle for ourselves we are good infrastructural people no reason why we shouldn't continue to do these things but i think the more important thing is to emphasize that we are a city state we are not a nation in a sense of a nation having lots of hinterland lots of resources we don't have that we need to compete therefore in narrower areas i don't like the word globalisation i think that's too big a word but i would be very happy say one of our newspapers acquired one of the maxwell group newspaper tomorrow and there's no reason in the world why we shouldn't think about doing that kind of work i think singaporean within our culture there are certain products that can still be globalised i don't see why mcdonalds should be mcdonalds and pizza should be the only globalised food products chinese food noddles uh paos and uh even peking ducks uh singapore food industry has gone into the roasting of ducks for singaporeans let's hope that they go abroad and sell it you know to the russians lots of hungry stomachs out there  martin dr onmae martin  i i think it's a paradox about it in the sense that uh we've been around as a nation in a sense with a free independent identity for about twenty odd years therefore we cling to this need to keep our individualism we keep talking about our ethnic roots but the other point that i think that dr onmae is getting at which is perhaps more important is that we are a city we are competitive with many other cities in the world to do that you begin to move into i suppose this word globalisation where our bankers for instance some of our bankers among the best bankers in the world one of the world's top traders in foreign exchange resides in singapore is a singaporean we have got good accountants we've got good lawyers what we have to do then is to draw the line and say what is needed to keep our identity as singaporean i think our prime minister mentioned you know 'char kway teow' might be the emphasis to what makes us feel singaporean we need to draw the line between what is singaporean and what is the need to keep us competitive as a global city the more we develop this idea of a mobile international urban elite where people move in and out across countries the more we will capture good people coming to singapore and no reason why a a good film director might not one day come to singapore because he likes the lifestyle here and uses this as a base from which to do his business for the a marketing man  martin  i would advise you when you want to globalise to go into that country and hire a bright young guy there who will probably be cheaper and i can still achieve my objective as an entrepreneur  martin  not necessarily within a globalise country and a globalise state come people work for for international companies people work for for salary for word for career goals and so on so long as you manage him properly and there are companies in singapore who have got a lot of offices and operations abroad who hire the locals nothing wrong with that i think there's nothing wrong with that except that we want to give our younger executives more exposure abroad so that hopefully they in time to come may lead other companies may break out on their own and perhaps this is where the contacts of name national values against international competition comes into play partly our singaporeans feel comfortable in singapore but the the common problem that is being state stated is the issue of say things like bilingualism if my child must learn mandarin if i am posted to china i suppose that's not a problem or taiwan but if i were to be posted somewhere else and if my child doesn't pick up enough mandarin then there could be very serious for his future i suppose so i think we have to make a trade-off here in singapore i'm not say that by by reason of this we should give up bilingualism  martin dr onmae martin  i'll like to raise a point that you know for instance our students who go to a country like say the states they do very well there and also many singaporeans do move outside singapore i think your generalisation might be for country as a whole but if you think of singapore as a city with clusters of people i think we can make our executives move a lot out of singapore the policy is less orientated towards elements such as say the educational issue which is linked with national values so i i believe that there are many opportunities for singaporeans to go abroad and that they can survive in the tough competitive world many of our bankers have lived outside and they have done quite well when they went out  dr onmae martin  i think finding the money is one thing the the thing to look at might be that you are talking about two groups of uh business one is for starters so for starters probably you really need seed money where the risk is higher the other group will be for what you said about the 'pao' uh sellers who has already a business going has proven some success and wants to first regionalise so i think that group is where the venture capitals should come in and the at the current state they don't take such big risk probably to look at it and take a bigger risk and actually help them out uh via a packaging a franchise road uh that would might involve uh lesser capital or actually finding them a business partner and i think the thing for singapore businesses to do now is probably to look at alliances look at grouping themselves together and then the seeking the market out because the market place outside is not uh as simple as what kent said earlier during the japanese days where they could uh sell a poorer or more inferior product because the market place at that time is freer the uh market demands for the goods are much larger than today today the competition is different so we should look at singapore now going into the next lap the first twenty-five years is pretty simple  martin  oh during our times as i have said earlier in the early seventies we started in seventy-one the demand is greater than supply and you just need to work a little harder opportunities were plenty today the situation is different at that point in time to start a capital you need to start a business you need very low capital you could actually pass your hat around and get started today you're talking about millions of dollars we started off with uh only twenty thousand dollars so it's a different ball game so we could see that opportunities are no more the same the uh stage of uh development is totally different now i agree with kent we are such a small population base hardly three million so we cannot be champions in everything so maybe  martin  well i i think the test of an entrepreneur is finally his ability to find the money sure bankers have to be conservative i think that and stock exchange have got to abide by its own rules and sure it's going to be very difficult you know but the poor pao maker just have to keep on going around passing his hats and badgering his relatives and looking for companies to buy-out sell-in or whatever i i uh agree with wee hock because at the end of the day the businessman must find his own market must find his own business but can we as a small state make it easier make it uh create the opportunities create the avenues so if i was talking earlier you have this people with bright ideas university students who come out with fantastic projects so entrepreneur in the making now where do they go so maybe in in the singapore's context we have to look for alternative maybe the setting up of an entrepreneurship fund might be useful martin  well when if we have a group or or a individual who has an idea and feel that he could sell coming to this uh committee that's managing a fund for instance  martin  can can i just cut in because uh within the edb during my time we had a lot of experience trying to set up funds hundred million dollar two hundred million dollar the problem is always administering it who do you give to the criterias and the risk of failures i think it should be singapore as a group or the government or the edb or whoever should provide the necessary incentives to overcome not to overcome the risk but to make the risk worth taking so some incentives must come for globalisation one particular one will be to implement maybe a a reverse tax incentive ten years since we give ten year pioneer status for companies to come here why not give ten year pioneer status to companies who go abroad if they are taxed abroad then that tax should be deductable against local word  it's a reverse pioneer status  dr onmae martin  i think that uh the attitude towards failure doesn't sorry i think kent's trying to come in  dr onmae martin i think he's got a point the point is that uh for singapore to grow bigger and the government having played a very large role in singapore you'll find that the more you want to go into the international competitive area the smaller the role the the government plays or should play or should be playing and maybe this is an important consideration we have developed a host lieu of government-linked companies 
Singapore	i think i agree with dr thurow that uhm entrepreneurship isn't is to a certain degree i think irrelevant to discussion of the singapore economy uhm i think what we need really is not so much more talk about entrepreneurship per se i don't think you can actually legislate entrepreneurship you can't uh bring it about with more management programmes uh i think what we need more is to talk about whether in the next lap we will have the kind of creativity the crine of kind of independent thinking that uh the whole population needs to achieve if we are going to achieve the next lap and if that is the case i think entrepreneurs will will come out and uh the mncs will also benefit better so i'm not too sure whether by focussing on whether entrepreneurship is dead or alive we are really focussing on whether the economy is going to do better or not  martin  well i think we need more creative thinking in the next lap whether the creative thinkers are going to be entrepreneurs or working in mncs i think we need more of that in the next lap because in the next lap with more emphasis on brain services if the type of people we're going to have in singapore are are not going to be more creative in their thinking then they're not even going to do well in mncs  martin  well uhm yes i think singapore do need entrepreneurs and uhm if you want to be an entrepreneur you ask yourself or let's say you have an idea and you say well i decide that uh i don't want to work for mncs anymore and that i want to be my own boss uh is that the only reason you want to be an entrepreneur ask yourself uhm if the reason is that uh perhaps you want to uhm have greater freedom okay as some people do or perhaps you want to see the result of your own achievement in terms of seeing the growth of the company that you set up or you would want to uhm have recognition uhm there are number of reasons or perhaps you want to be very rich one of these days okay  martin  well if you become an entrepreneur or try to become an entrepreneur because it's glamourous or because everybody else seems to be doing it i think that's the reason to be to be one uhm perhaps you are not so focussed that's that's quite important to be quite focussed in what you want to do  martin  yah i think you have state entrepreneurship already existing very much in singapore  martin  what if you have to ask yourself whether you are needed in considering whether you you want to be an entrepreneur or not than i think you shouldn't be an entrepreneur to begin with  martin  i think there's room for you in the domestic economy i think singapore is a tracheotomized economy you've got the mnc sector you've got the large uh government link companies and the large public listed companies and then you have a rather small domestic sector i think there's quite a lot of room for entrepreneurship within the domestic sector as to whether you can make that jump from being a small time essentially city oriented economy as dr thurow said whether you can make that leap to becoming even more national regional entrepreneur i think that is a very good question to ask  martin dr thurow martin dr thurow martin  well my view is that uh the government's stand on the role of the entrepreneur or entrepreneurship in singapore is not explicit and if you look for the clues the clues are there in terms of where they gonna be allocating resources in the next lap you know with regard to uh singapore's economy but unless the stay is made more explicit it is very difficult for the other tier in the economy to response ie the institutions uh aided professional bodies the organisation and so forth  martin  dr thurow  if i could add to that i think i think uhm in the problem of entrepreneurship really is like when you mention failure it's like dealing with the problem impotence it's dealing with the problem of failure in that sense and it's also problem of attitude you've got to be more relaxed about your failure you've got to be more relaxed about the overall environment the social culture environment the educational environment the regulatory environment well it's very uh it's very odd to be on one hand very anxious about failure and be very anxious about and very uptight about uh whether we've promoting entrepreneurship enough or not and exatly like dealing with impotence you just got to be more relaxed as a society as a whole relaxed about failure relaxed about many other things that we have including regulations and when that kind of attitudinal environment exist then i think entrepreneurship will arise on its own accord i don't think you can structure it and and mandate and and order it to come about  martin  well i think a lot depends on the individual alright if you are strong enough alright and uh that your inclination and your ambition is that you want to make it and that you take that important step and all you see is that you want to make it and the very thought of failure should be right at the back of your the far end at the back of your mind okay take that plunge here i would agree with uh with rachel totally i i think in the singapore context this is gonna be very difficult to change the environment in terms you know the low tolerance for failures at the end of the day it has got to be with you the entrepreneur martin  now i i would disagree i would disagree with that view totally i think we should not take it as a given that singapore society is going to have this high level of intolerance for failure we should take it as a given and therefore we just praise uhm and try to nurture those entrepreneurs who have made it i think history has shown that a lot of entrepreneurs will finally become successful were not successful initially and i think the the the the crux of the problem really is with the educational system uhm an educational system which on one hand i think we should certainly we should certainly promote meritocracy we should give a lot of attention to achievement orientation but there should not be that collorary stigma attached to failure i think in educational system today we have a lot of young people who at a very age already think they're washed out and they're failures luckily i think educational system is changing today so that those people who are not like to word that much uh to do that well in in grades and academically now probably can find other areas where entrepreneurial flair can be developed they can go to fashion school they can do a lot of other things which previously they could not do but you know i think a lot of it starts from young if you're going to be risk averse when you're young if you are scared to try things because you think if you fail your peers are going to look down upon you uh society is going to look down upon you and that happens to you when you're a teenage what are you going to be like at the age of thirty there will be very few rachel swees around  martin dr thurow martin  well i guess uh you have to do a number of things you know first is you got to sit down and think through it and uh i would advise uh you to think about uh where you are right now and give due consideration to the best case worst case scenario and uh you know if it makes sense to you uh after due delineation have been exercised push on with it  martin  well i'm talking about okay thinking about things like you know how are you going to market it i'm thinking about uh you know who who will who will buy your you know your new uh product  martin  crazy absolutely crazy  martin  well maybe if you were a phd in zoology first okay and genetic engineering and everything else maybe i would say okay i'll take a little look at it but i would say i'll be a little bit doubtful that you could hybridise the chicken and the duck anyway  martin  good good for you  martin  it'll help a little bit  martin  have you done a survey of the market as to whether people would want to consume products like that that's right who likes eating chucks you know what i call due word   martin  alright what are the potential what are the potential market i mean who are your target audience so to speak and uhm what kind of return do you expect of it  martin dr thurow martin  you need resources  martin  i think there are a lot of them  martin  i think there's a difference i think that the example you took of entrepreneurship highlights i think a misconception of what successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurship could be i think that for every one chuck inventor like you there are probably ten thousand other people who have think they have designed a better mouse-trap a better hair-styling lotion or whatever these are the the product entrepreneurs that thinkers and the inventors i think the ratio of success for these people actually is very very small but the other kind of entrepreneur which is likely to be able to succeed i think a bit better is probably the more practical kind perhaps people who work in an mnc an not one person three four people from an mnc come out of mnc and then provide an word already existing type of service or product probably at a cheaper price with an improvement so you don't have that uh that sort the rather more romantic idea of the entrepreneur the thomas addison who invents the lightbulb i think that's really too romanticised what i would call organisation sponsered  martin  uhm i think you should go to your uncle your grandfather every other rich relative you have because seriously if you got a chuck idea uh especially that has got to do animals which is another big problem altogether because you're dealing with a lot of other intangibles and even creating a computer uhm i don't think any venture word is really going to finance you so hope you have a rich uncle and or marry somebody very rich that's the only way you're going to get your money  martin dr thurow martin  but i think there is a very fundamental quantitative difference between this chuck and ben and jerry's ice-cream because the ben and jerry ice-cream is an incremental innovation it's providing a product that's already very well-known with manufacturing processes that are also very well-known it's creating a market niche for itself within an already very large market the us ice-cream market and it's creating a different kind of product so in in that sense if you didn't create a chuck if you found a new way of making hainanese chicken rice that was better quality uh then i may be willing to finance you but my concern is that this chuck is quite different from ben and jerry's ice-cream it's a totally new product that has never been tried out before martin dr thurow  i think there're two ways one would be to look for venture capital funds that are purely venture capital funds  now the one problem with that is that many of these funds have very high uh hundle criteria for return on investments and they also have a short pay back period they've got to be able to cash out of your investment within five years or so so there's a lot of stress on you if you get a pure venture capital fund on the other hand you've also got very large companies insurance companies some of the glcs operating enterprises that have got investment arms and i think these investments arms are in many ways better partners uh on one hand they bring to you not just money nor just professional expertise in terms of pretty professional expertise but they also bring to you a lot of connections that they may have in their own operating ventures uh and in this respect i think one should consider not just getting money from banks nor just pure venture capital funds but finding an actual operating partner to go into business with you 
Singapore	but first singlish on tv with me tonight the people who featured prominently in the recent debate elaine ong an undergraduate elaine wrote to the press last week to say that singlish should not be used on tv sidney wyse a newsletter editor wrote in to agree with her jacintha absheganaden entertainer and presenter of mum's not cooking she disagrees with both of them they have slug it down on the papers now we'll get a chance to hear their views direct on tv the question is should we say can we use singlish or singlish can or not in any case you're wondering why we're talking about this night here's why  footage  fairly provocative comment from kerpal that's a good starting point for our discussion this evening elaine let me start with you some people who read your letter to the press to the paper say that uhm you come across as someone quite ashamed of slinglish is that a fair comment uhm firstly i like to say that i don't believe that there is such a thing as singlish what you call singlish i would call bad english because a a term like don't shy uhm do you consider that singlish or bad english what's the difference who's the arbiter here of of uh of that i mean uh are you saying that don't shy is you're saying don't say don't shy is it is it bad english or is it singlish or are they the same thing does it matter it does actually why you see when you say don't shy but if i said to you uh sidney if i said to you uh join me join me don't shy well that's different now when you say don't shy it's it's uh it's not correct it's improper and you let you have not actually word  but are you considering that the context in which i'm saying it well then you may have to explain that to to the viewers i am an entertainer and i am the presenter of a show well as as an entertainer and a presenter you have two things to think about one children two adults as adults we are quite comfortable with that such languages but as as language language i meant uh but with a child you have a serious problem no it's not my problem sydney i'm just an entertainer as an entertainer i'm allowed to suspend belief okay because i may not be acting or presenting as myself jacintha i may be presenting a persona now that persona within the parameters of the show uh is allowed to uh take on a certain things which are part of entertainment now entertainment is about magic it's about uhm there are a lot of children now in singapore who believes that if they go on the living room carpet uh they will fly but i don't think so i don't think so is is it about gibberish sorry is it about gibberish is it about gibberish sydney yes yes well let let me put it this way sydney may i may intervene yes uhm i think your concern is really very much uh whether children will misunderstand will be misled misled is that is that your i don't think children can make the difference they can't they cannot differentiate okay growing children would have a a problem there because they will take it as the correct english will children take it to be the correct english yes they will uh what would be the role of parents in trying to direct them accordingly but can you imagine the parent spending every other second correcting their child and say don't follow this don't use it this is incorrect than what the word show there are many informal situations in the home where singlish is used you see i feel very much that this discussion is kind of passe really is uh we're we're being a bit old-fashioned here in discussing discussing singlish in the first place no i think there's a time and place where i use to speak there is a time and place precisely okay okay let's let's take about that time and place for discussing it the context uhm so you talk about context and perhaps you can also talk about motivation you know uh why is this person using singlish and why using this particular thing programme or uh as or or or discussion live discussion as a forum let's discuss that what did what is appropriate who decides what's appropriate uhm that was my question to you yah elaine when you said appropriate what do you mean by he asked the question yah yah i mean for whom is it appropriate who decides whether this is permissible or not maybe you should have a body that actually regulates another body to regulate not another body i think before you even initiate you i don't think we're talking about language here you see i feel very much that singlish is not about language it's about a subculture okay ja jacintha maybe we should let uh sydney complete his thoughts yes uh i think before we actually initiate uh a programme we have to seek uh the opinion of the majority how they would react and if you if they feel uncomfortable or they feel that the programme is not suitable for the general public don't feature it if this is the way we're thinking about most things in singapore then uhm you know it might be very very hard to launch many things because we are very kiasu as uhm as kumar said just now you may be kiasu no no no no but i don't think the majority of the people are kiasu i think there are people how do we do this poll you know nothing will get started we must be spontaneous we should be we should just try you see we don't have to we don't have to put ourselves in an incorrect situation no we're certainly don't so you're agreeing with me that singlish is is i am not okay perhaps perhaps we we may not be getting anywhere if we use terms like incorrect because incorrect is really subjective incorrect in what sense uh if you're using grammar as a as a yardstick yah perhaps in it is it isn't correct but if you are suggesting that oh if we can agree that it is something that's been evolving naturally in singapore then i have to suggest that we have to see it from a different point of view let me just put it to you this way if we your concern is children are impressionable they could be misled yes but there are many other ways perhaps that children could be misled media is one way so do you think we could end up cloistering them and over protecting them which was my point in the newspaper that perhaps you know we should be able to learn to laugh at ourselves a liitle bit more and that uh but there should be a time when you have to stop but not like this but not yes but not laugh at the stupidity of ourselves i mean if that oh no no nobody is suggesting that we're being patronising by using singlish that's what i mean i don't feel that singlish is about language and sometimes it's not what you say it's how you say it if i said you as i was saying before uhm join me join me don't shy you might forget that i didn't put the be in it you know but if i said to you join me join don't shy uh it sounds singlish so sometimes it's the tone in which we speak uh or we use singlish but you can't understand one thing you are an en an en an entertainment as you mentioned earlier you should understand that alright and being an entertainer you could easily influence especially the growing children not so much the adult you won't influence me but you will influence the little girl the little boy now who's responsible for bad english it's you sydney if i may come in on this now uhm some people feel in fact quite a few people feel in singapore that it is closely linked to a to our national identity it is not the national identity but it's closely linked uh in your letter you did end by saying that treat singlish as nothing more than a joke uh were you serious about that i'll be very serious may i set a language example that a hundred years ago a word like perambulator was the standard form usage of what we now know as pram and you know you might a hundred years ago it would be absolutely correct to say excuse me but could you please move your perambulator but now we say excuse me please move your pram okay okay if that's what you're saying ah what was slang what was considered slang it's what you are saying now it's just it's just like a typewriter it's just like a typewriter okay my dear friends my dear friends if if we go this way i don't think we can come to any agreement not that we should come to an agreement but let me put this question to you is it possible at all for us to come to some form of agreement on this issue some form of agreement and what would that be let me let me have a very quick comment from each of you let me start from elaine elaine i i don't think so i don't think there's a middle line where you say yes sometimes you use it i mean on the media sometimes you don't in the media but so you feel that there's no way we can agree there's no way we can compromise either we use it or we don't in the on the media yah jacintha can we agree on something on this issue i totally agree that the use of singlish has to be taken in whatever context me uhm and therefore uh when you say it's use in certain situations it's absolutely correct to use certain in a court i wouldn't say to the judge uh i wouldn't speak singlish to the judge we have to use why not uh if you are so proud about uh no no i'm not talking about the two faces of the use of language quick comment okay can we just wrap up your thought please we're running out i want to communicate to my fellow singaporean and in many situations from me to communicate in a friendly are you underestimating the the ability of the singaporeans you certainly sound defensive and uncommunicative now in your formal okay thanks sydney your word your thoughts please do you think we can agree on something here i think that for as long as you want uh i mean for example if if you want to speak english speak it the correct way now there are times you might why should you be so pretentious you you might fumble there are times you might fumble but that does not in any way uh put you in a very bad situation but if you deliberately speak singlish then i think that's bad because you are encouraging improper english okay well looks like we really cannot come to any kind of agreement it's an age old debate age old discussion uhm perhaps we should just let it evolves naturally without perhaps promoting it or forcing it 
Singapore	good evening and welcome to talking point your weekly forum where you can give your views live on air here on channel news asia i'm ida bachtiar tonight we are discussing a very real dilemma for many married couples in singapore having children population experts are already warning us that we're just not producing enough babies to replace ourselves but more couples these days are choosing to stop at just one or two or even none at all is it their fast pace lifestyles a demanding career money before family it could be any number of individual factors but a common one could very well be what prime minister goh chok tong recently suggested childcare concerns now how much does this stop couples from having more children do take part in our discussion by calling 6910028 so are you in the same boat do you think better support services will help after all grand parents aren't available to baby-sit and you can't afford or you are not comfortable in hiring a maid what are your options really please share your comments and questions with us by calling at 6910028 and here to give their perspectives we have in the studio nominated mp dr jennifer lee and associate professor ngiam tee liang from the national university of singapore we'll be back with your calls stay with us welcome back to talking point our focus tonight what's keeping singaporeans from having more children are childcare problems the issue and what more can government authorities and companies do to help to share their views and answer some of your questions is dr jennifer lee nmp and ceo of kk hospital and associate professor nigam tee liang from the nus social work and psychology department thank you so much for coming into studio before i begin our discussion perhaps i could read to you some of the emails that we have gotten seems to be quite a heart-felt topic we have uh an email here from daphanie chng she says i'm a full-time working mother of a six-month-old baby girl the financial status of my husband and i don't allow us to engage a maid plus we don't feel safe leaving the maid alone with our baby so my mother currently looks after her during the day but she's not willing to live with us so we have to travel about two and a half hours everyday and in the end we don't get much we don't get to interact much with our baby we're also worried my mother's surroundings might not be giving my baby best influence we believe as parents we should give our best and we'd like to have more kids because of this we are now thinking twice there's another email also from kenny and kenny says here i believe the drastic drop in fertility rates can be attributed to an increase in well-educated highly qualified women unlike a decade ago our globalised economy has forced numerous women to venture out of the home as the traditional stereotyped of wives carrying a baby in one arm and a mop in the other is eradicated we are seeing more cases of singapore women holding top jobs in mncs well clearly times has changed and right you know most people are not looking towards having children to look after them i their old age women don't need to have children to prove that they are worth something what then are we looking at is singapore going to see this uh as an increasing trend of women not wanting to have children what is what's your feelings about it uh well i think the uh figures are there for us i track them very closely because uhm you know more babies are good for us talking about kk hospital uh very purely selfish reasons but yes uhm you can see that the trends are the fertility rates has gone down and despite all our efforts it continues to be that way uh it's a multi- word problem so i don't think there's any simple answers and i think what we'll be talking about childcare that's definitely one of the issues but not the only one yes we have two callers already waiting to join us in studio if you may i'd just like to go to them too hi you're with talking point may i know who is that please hello yah good evening hello good evening yes i am raymond yip hi raymond what would you like to say just want to comment uh thing is that i think the uhm of course everyone knows the problems uhm that you know uhm that prevent people from having more children one of the main concerns is uh is the childcare issue which is very important to families especially families wanted the best of their children the other thing of course with childcare expenses is not cheap so it's very high for those who have two or even three children uh uhm how many do you have two two myself are you planning to have another one uh very concern about the financial situation right and the help uh in fact nowadays the in-laws and parents are very reluctant to chip in to help right so uh i'm concern more on the financial aspect where even uh i know of friends who having three children even uh the mother herself have to quit the job for three to four years to stay home okay  word that is really taxing on the husband right raymond thank you very much for joining us thank you we have another caller on the line hi you're with talking point may i know who's that please hello yes hi could you speak up a little bit hi this is joanne yap i'm calling about this third child issue because i'm currently expecting my third child and she's due to arrive already in january but up to now i'm quite surprised to find out that the government is not supporting us with any maternity leave at all so i really hope that the government body would try and impose this rule so that word because knowing that if nobody should say it's a compulsory thing no companies would give it to any mothers this is a fact so if the government can look at it it's like a  word thing like uhm if a women having a third child goes away on maternity they can somehow get some kind of maybe like rebates from the government or whatsoever then word encourage women to have more children i guess okay thank you very much for joining us thank you so we've a situation where the government is saying this there's just not enough people having babies so like scholars said you know it's like national service at the same time we're facing two issues here uhm financial concerns and childcare concerns what is your feeling about the way the policy are instituted in singapore is there enough being done it is true that the policy so far that's been implemented by the government has actually to meet sometimes what we called multiple conflicting objectives because on the one hand you would want to have more birth but it is how you try to encourage so the tax incentives are there no maternity leave for the third child but uh you could have your tax breaks but that is only for those who are paying income tax so it is a concern for those who would like to have more but they don't seem to be in that income bracket that the government has in mind and this is where we have to turn to other measures other than just a physical incentives and uh it does mean relooking at the whole package of childcare subsidies for your children to be in childcare centres uh the operating costs and of course more importantly the community support system i think so far we have not touched on this area where in the past it has been quite uh accepted traditional way in which you have uh child-minder in the neighbourhood you have got uh local babysitters uhm that is a big issue that we need to actually address i think uhm i think three parties need to get involve in this we singaporeans are firstly we always think of government pitching to help in one way or the other but i think also companies in terms of uh family friendly policies and i think also individuals uhm if we talk first perhaps about companies uhm i think in developed countries there is an awareness of uh the need to retain women in the workforce and uh there are quite a few companies now more and more who have put in who pay a lot attention to having family friendly practices and the there are there is a whole range of of these but the most important would be uhm two things one is flexibility in working arrangements so that it's easier for people to manage working moms to manage flexi-time part-time you know tele working things like that uhm the second big thing is of course would be onsite childcare centres so if you have a combination of these that would help but i think we also have to be realistic about uhm you have to convince companies to do this and uhm i i personally feel and for kk hospital especially because we have eighty-seven per cent women and it is very important for us to retain you know women in the workforce working with us even after they have kids uhm there are things that you can do but you need to be convinced that it make sense ultimately to the company that you are not in any way going to affect productivity or word  but uhm what people don't realise i think is the cost of losing a well-trained experienced skilled person the the is not just a matter of going out to interview you know to advertise interview and recruit is that whole cycle of training someone uhm of the drop in service uhm levels as you are having some new young person onboard so i think if we could have some work done that could convince local companies that this is something that is important for them to look at then that would be very good i'd like to go into that a little further we have another caller though joining us hi you're with talking point may i know who is that please okay i'm chandra from telok blangah calling hi chandra yes my point is that uh you know there are so much emphasis on children and all that nowadays and if the mother is not at home to look after the kid i think i'm afraid there is this problem of latch-key kids coming up here so uh this is very much seen in today's scenario in singapore especially so i think uh parents are very afraid to have another child coming to this world when there is no one to really properly care for it you know in terms of real parental care and that's the main problem that people are facing in having another child right and having the wife not work is not uh a solution either yes exactly okay thank you very much for joining us chandra thank you thank you bye bye so even if we solved the problem by getting your employers to uh somehow you find a way to lobby that uhm you're still spending time away from work uh away from your child at the same time you also need to work because you need to earn the income for your child what are we looking at then you know we have this conflicting uhm aspirations in in women nowadays you know they want to work and want to have a child do you see this as something that can be resolved 
Singapore	the committee however recognised the limitations of using the c p i to measure the cost of living it proposed two key refinements one to have three c p is for different income groups and two that imputed rentals used for measuring housing cost be brought more closely in line with market rentals now to elaborate i have uh deputy director with the institute of policy studies economist doctor lee tsao yuan and nominated m p mister chia shi teck good evening why don't we look straight away at this question of uh how housing is computed and put into the uh c p i because this is the one area that the committee uh specifically mentioned and one might say even criticise now why is this such a difficult issue it's a very difficult issue because one wants to actually capture in some ways the consumption that one gets out of housing rather than housing as an investment per say so actually one of the best methodologies used is really this imputed rental concept the difficulty though with that in singapore is that eighty-seven per cent of households in singapore own their own homes so then the question is how does one then impute rent to actually a house which is actually lived in by its owners and that is the difficulty for public housing so that is why the committee has recommended that actually the imputed rental computation be improved okay how are they gonna do this uhm i mean what is the real problem that uh according to the report you used h d b prices rental prices uhm for housing rental price yes but the thing is that these rental prices actually are applicable to those flats which are actually rented out which are smaller flats like one-room two-room flats they're not the three room four-room flats that the majority of singaporeans live in nowadays so while private housing i think it's fairly well taken care of because there is actually quite a good rental market for private pricing but when one comes to public housing then i think there is some difficulty so it is hoped that actually the authorities can do something about improving this measure okay now i thought the committee sorry did uh look the private sector's uh rental prices and try to compute it and the uh effect is rather small but here we we must add because of the eighty-seven per cent the home ownership in singapore it is unique in its own right and we are looking at the uh investment side of the housing taking the fact that the property values will go up but what if the value comes down i think that would be uh how would it be taken as a consumption i think that is the point okay that's one issue now are there any other limitations with the c p i as an index shi teck yah i think the c p i is a general uh indicator it doesn't a a person or a family at any point in time say if you're buying a house or if you're buying a car your c your car is due for new c o e then the impact on you will be higher or you are you have aged parents or you have students that go to universities so your feeling of the cost of living that has gone up is much higher than the general indicator so the c p i should be take taken as a general indicator and it has its limitations now i think uh david if i may add to that i think that the the one important question that we need to settle here is what does the c p i actually measure right i think most singaporeans are really thinking of a cost of living index for example if they take a bowl of noodles in a hawker centre and then they also take a bowl of noodles in a noodle house where the c p i is concerned those are actually two different items altogether and therefore it's not so much just the price change alone but also a quality change which the cost of living index measures but a c p i measures very strictly only the price change and not the quality change okay now one other issue is the whole question of weightage uhm in a separate minority report committee member lau teir kiang uh said that the c p i is deficient in some respects because the weightage given to some key items like medical care education housing and cars and and private transport does not reflect recent changes in government policy now have these changes had a major impact on household expenditure i think we will really only know when we get the result of the ninety-two ninety-three household expenditure survey having said that however based on past experience in comparing the eighty-seven eighty-eight expenditure survey with that of eighty-two eighty-three there were only minor changes and it really resulted in just small changes in the c p i now does that as i said the impact on the particular family or person is dependent on the person's uh spending pattern or the person's habit at that point in time if you have aged parents that need to go to hospital and all of a sudden you are hit well does this therefore render the current weightage irrelevant no the weightage is relevant but the person that is affected at any point in time may not be the time you you're talking about general indicator and that's why the committee actually dealt in the four key e area to to zero in on what actually is uh worrying people okay but then why do you want to to go to the ninety-two ninety-three uhm survey household survey because that will that will probably have weights which are more relevant to the current period but having said that however my own call it suspicion or intuition as it were is that i think that there were only result in small changes in the c p i increases but but you will make it more you'll bring it more up-to-date now very quickly in in writing the report as you were one of key uh persons in writing the report were there any issues in which uh you had difficulties sort of gaining consensus yes i think we had difficulties with regards to housing and i think shi teck had a lot to say about housing for instance just housing i think more than housing yes i think you were saying earlier we we must not take c p i to represent everything the basket must be there because we spend on all kinds of things and the weightage is given to the kind uh to to the importance but what affects us may be one particular item and that we we have forgotten we just look zero on our item and thing that the cost of everything has gone up in in that particular okay we'll come back with further discussion on on the report we gonna take a break now when we come we look at the committee's findings on cost increases in housing education health and transport higher expectations versus higher costs singaporeans want more of the good life which does not come cheap in a country facing scare resources how can two seemingly opposing factors be reconciled uhm shi teck want do you think i think first and foremost we must accept the fact that there are limitations and there is a price to pay so the government's role basically is the lower income group is the affordability so to make sure that people can afford to buy the roof over their head and they can afford to fall sick but uh for those who are looking for a dream homes then they would have to work for it and the that is where we have to accept the fact that there are limitations yes now you i think the key question here is the extend to which government uh policies and government actions actually raise the cost of these items to what extend does this happen i think of the four factors mentioned if i were to actually order them in terms of priority i would think that the two most important would be first scarce resources rapid economic growth if it were not for the recession i think in eighty-five eighty-six i think cost would have risen much more so rapid economic growth is very important second i would think that expectations upgrading the desire for a better quality of life if you add to that the fact of the timing of the fee increases that bunched everything up together it doesn't mean actually though that these cost increases would not have occurred and also the reduction of subsidy rates i think is also another important factor but that is i think a much more fundamental ideological question and i agree with the government's stand that we should not adopt hefty social welfare policies but even the limitations uh da david cost must go up so now the question is what kind of policies we must adopt to ensure that the cost don't go out of the reach of the people because it's not just the lower uh group of people there are people who want to aspire it will it would be the dream that actually motivate them to work further imagine that you you can never own a house then nobody will want to work anymore so i think it is the the control and maybe certain kind of a a assistance should be uh looked in in the kind of the policies we have i i don't buy that everything should be left to market forces because given the limitations there's just no market forces to determinate the land is scarce you can corner up the land or the people in the car industry must buy up the c o es because they got to sell cars so that itself is already uh clear that it's not a open uh market forces so with that in mind we have to move and uh uh manipulate a little well what can the government do about the rate of these price increases i think one of the main things is still back to productivity increases there no way around it or else we will definitely get a wage price spiral higher prices higher wages leading to higher prices and so on i think i agree but on the other hand is government departments should not be run as business corporations their job is to facilitate their job is not to make money so if if taken off their head then i think the cost itself need not go up uh that quickly for instance we accept that the land is scarce and that it should go with the market price but remembering that we acquire the land or the government's cost of land is much lower so and land is a big factor to to uh the cost of housing so whether the land need to be pushed to such a high price are we asking people to lower moderate their expectations yes we have to accept the fact that there are limitations and we must work it's alright to want to drive big cars and live in big houses but you got to work for it i think that part we have to accept and the government is not here as a santa claus no government can continue to be santa clauses is it legitimate for people of the lower or the middle uh classes to fear that these costs will increase to such an extend as to make them unaffordable i think that we examine actually this question in detail and i think that we did come to the conclusion that in terms of affordability that basic housing basic health care basic education and transportation et cetera are indeed affordable but if you want that bit more than as shi teck has pointed out you've got to earn it  there is there seems to be an inevitablity in uh the rise of of prices of some of these scare commodities especially things like housing and cars which are the two things that that most people aspire to is it do we just have to throw our hands up in the air and say well this is evitable we can't help it no i think the the alternatives are important as i mentioned earlier if the public transportation is improved such that it's so efficient on or the other hand if you live with no road control system the roads will be choked that nobody will want to drive anyway so you either leave it you know and and let the natural course take its place or you have some uh regulation some control so it's it's not a a and or kind of thing it's all in our mind you know if you go to hong kong big tycoons are taking m r ts so it's a livestyle so i think we we can uh improve alternatives are important or in a health care do you need to go to a one-room with television air-conditioned and all the frills or is it more important to ensure that the proper medical attention is given and that itself can be made affordable now which of these uh items did the committee consider to be of most concern education housing transport uhm all of them i think all the four all of them equally equally uh important yah yes but i think that it is also important they want to consider cost increases to think about income increases as well and if you look at the perspective of let's say the last ten years i think incomes have risen faster than cost standards of living have indeed improved and i think that that's one thing that the singaporeans must uh pay tribute to the government i mean all of us have actually improved in the quality of life uh shi teck yuan thank you very much for sharing your views with us and for being on moneymind 
Singapore	the telecom share offer at two dollars a share its total value is a staggering thirty point five billion dollars that's more than twice the value of the all time favourite singapore airlines so just how can you make the most of this offer or to discuss this i have in the studio t k yap director of peregrine securities and fong pui leng investment analyst of r h b cathay research thank you for joining me this evening now two dollars a share is this reasonable yes certainly i think if you look at their p es twenty-seven times p e uhm by it all judgements uhm it is within the range of expectations the market was looking for a launch of uhm something even above thirty times p e do you agree with that yes i do agree it is reasonable i mean it's very much i mean the offer of valuation is very much in line with uh the world market valuation of telcos uh i mean telecommunication companies uh though it is on the high end of the twenty-two twenty-nine times uh p e range that the all these telcos are trading at okay now for the singaporean investor who's eligible for all three categories a b and c what strategy do you think they should take t k well obviously uhm category a group group a shares are now uh uh good value i will suggest this uhm going for the maximum number of shares one is entitled to under a and and for c the number of shares one would apply for would depends on one's uh financial background okay now and group c is the main question is what to bid what should people be bidding for group c well uhm even though it's at a high end of the uh i mean the range that the uh world type communication companies are trading at i'd say there's still a lot of upside uh given that you know the market condition here is a bit different we have very low interest rate very mild inflation and there's a lot of liquidity in the market uhm my gut feeling is that it can trade more than thirty times p e up to probably thirty-seven times they will put the evaluation at the two-sixty per share two-sixty a share well let's say i think if you look at forty times p e uhm three dollars that's what the market has been talking about that's what the expectations have been for foreign investors who want the stock they have to bid and they would put up the price so therefore you do want the share you have no choice but to join the bidding process not not very different from the way the c o es have worked and it really comes down to whether you want the share and how bad you want it uhm telecom issue adds about thirty billion to the market capitalisation institutions will have to increase weightage if those are tracking the market on the market cap basis in the region and so for that reason either they buy the other shares in singapore or they put in the bids for telecom so you've talked about foreign interests what do you expect foreign institutions to be bidding i would say that uh they would bid in excess of three dollars that's just the general feel that's been going around the market today uhm they obviously feel that the premium would be worth paying for uhm but the there is quite a wide diversity of views amongst foreign institutions okay now what about the upside potential in the shorter term couple of weeks what do you expect uhm trading to open november first uh that's a very difficult question to answer if you can tell me how how the market will be trading by then i would the market uh perhaps can be looked upon as being supported by a base of fundamentals and on top of that you have two pillars one's liquidity and one's market sentiment if sentiment excuse me remains liquidity is there i think you're gonna see uhm a very very firm opening price in excess of the cut off price by then what do you say what will the price be in november first well uh matters word by t k say to the lot depends on the market condition there uh i think it will still be very firm this sentiment in the market uhm i won't be surprise if it opens at uh above the two sixty i mean given that there's a lot of interest among the uh oversea i mean as well as the local fund managers uh in this issue i mean is is going to be a real heavy weight of i mean singapore telecom listing uh it's going to raise the market cap by about twenty per cent to account for about sixteen per cent i mean it's something that you know they could not miss out on if they were to uh be i mean their portfolio were to invest in singapore stock i think they they will come in you know uh drive the share price up by bidding it at a higher price to make sure that they do get a portion of the uh offer how much how much will they bid probably three dollars okay now are you as optimistic in the longer term for singapore telecom share prices i would say in the longer term a number of different factors will come in uhm one obviously would be how the global environment changes given that the word singapore telecom in intends to move uhm towards the global arena uh deregulation changes a lot of caveats uhm so at this point in time uh the bet one has to make is whether the match will be able to sustain the continued growth now thirteen per cent is i think uhm what would be towards the longer end of general market expectations although most do feel that sixteen fifteen per cent uh for ninety-three is what uh telecoms will be able to comfortably deliver okay we'll be discussing more about longer term growth later well if you stay on the short-term outlook for the telecom share issue we'll take a break now when we come back find out if singapore telecom can deliver in the longer term pui leng t k a small and fast maturing market at home and question marks at the end of the monopoly can singapore telecom maintain double digit growth pu leng well as i've said uh well i've heard the singapore telecoms uh is still faced with very bright prospect well let's say with the home front uh if you're merely talking about just connecting lines to new subscribers well i should say the singapore telecoms has done a very good job uh we have what two to three one in two to three uh people having a a telephone line uh but then if you were to look at uhm i mean if we're to compare it with let say the more advanced country like the states u k japan uh we still have a lot of room to grow but i i felt the for the domestic side of the business uh for singapore telecom the greater growth potential will lies in more providing more enhance services like probably dial-up uh videos and information retrieval uh which is becoming uh a i mean a reality with the increase use of optical fibres so i said at the home front there'll still be a lot of growth potential of course in the medium term uh well the growth to account from you know rising international calls uhm increasing use of uhm you know uhm mobile phones with increasing mobility of people as well as uh increase data communication traffic what about after the monopoly ends well after the monopoly ends uh i think singapore uh telecom will still be the main provider uh it's difficult uh for you know another operator to duplicate the massive infra-structure that uh singapore telecom has uh invested in it would take a bit of uh time t k double digit growth well i think that's certainly possible they were in word one wants to make big money or any stock uh you have to take bets and big bets these bets will centre around the quality of management and the bet is that the management will continue uh to be very profit driven generate a lot of extra business and the case of s i a we've seen that being done extremely successfully now in the case of singapore telecom uh it will take time uh for them to be able to demonstrate that growth at this point in time i think the bet that one has to take is that the management uh will have enough drive uh to ensure that the double gi digit continues to to come through now judging on the past track record it seems that there's no reason to doubt that it would not be able to but uh the asian pacific region is extremely fast growing region that means hea very heavy competition at the end of the day uh the competition is going to come from people who see the same opportunities okay what about overseas expansion singapore telecom are relying a lot on that where's that going to well any overseas venture is gonna have to take time to nurture and mature so i think uh you're really looking for cash cow  word domestic business to feed the growth in the overseas expansion how well you manage that growth and how well you cultivate it uh would determine how well those overseas opportunities are turned into cash cows so very iffy it is very iffy because uh it really depends on one two years from now how may deals telecom will land uh one two years from now what the cash flow and the profitability of those ventures are gonna be like uhm obviously there will be a learning process okay what a what about long term for the singapore telecom share price what are gonna be the critical factors for its continued growth from a point of view of the foreign investors uhm the asia pacific region holds tremendous growth potential they therefore would be looking at the individual telecommunications place in the different markets p l d in phillipines for example hong kong telecom on hong kong market malaysian telecom uh in in malaysia uh as far as the growth potential is concerned uhm many of these i think would be looking to expand outside the domestic market on top of the growth they can see their own domestic markets in ten years singapore telecom will be at will it be ten fifteen dollars i think there's every possibility you could see that but for that to continue every growth company continues to evolve continues to develop and for that to happen uh we certainly would need to see singapore telecom continue to land major projects major deals uh that will increase profitability significantly do you see singapore telecom ten years ten dollars well is this possible i mean there's a possibility always uhm well longer-term growth will be from their globalisation drive i mean they have invested quite a lot in their overseas ventures and i expect this uh to be uh paying back in in by the end of this decade and it would be very significant when the pay back comes in okay what impact is singapore telecom issue gonna to have on the local market uh well as we have seen you know by today's market well it uh sort of uh you know drive up i mean uh uh interest in the singapore uh market will it increase the price of other g l cs t k  possibly i think there're two ways to look at that one is that singapore telecom is a fairly large-sized market kept stock uh for that reason investor who invest in singapore on the basis of market capitalisation within the reason within the region will have to increase weightage in singapore they do that by buying the other uh proxies of the singapore market or they can buy singapore tel word telecom directly for that reason i think a number word of them would go on to bid fairly aggressively to lock in a fair amount of shares in initial process of tender for the c shares okay well thank you very much we've run out of time thank you very much for joining me on moneymind tonight well if you're all excited about the singapore telecom share offer it opens tomorrow and you have until the twenty-eighth of this month to apply 
Singapore	now you were interviewed sometime ago uh by the business times i believe i think it's called the conversation at raffles and you made some very very that's right uh shall we say very remarkable statements if i might say and the pardon me for putting on my glasses i would like to quote from what you've said you said that there are three priorities for the malay muslim community in singapore to develop a singapore brand of islam to become active and even proactive players in forging an enhancing religious harmony in the country and to maximise the community's economic potential and you went on to include malays to become must become more self confident to reach beyond the community and to want to do better uhm i suppose these are fairly self-evident truths and they are very logical and non-controversial but what made you to put those principles in such stirring terms i mean is there a need for that uh uh uh in malay community you know while we've as as a community the malay muslim community in singapore has been through difficult times i saw it first to know that in in in in three decades actually post independence we first started off by feeling that you know that almost like everybody else owe us a living that's rather strong oh boy yes and we thought that uh we're sort of sons of the soil we and and it's true actually not only of singapore malays but also practically of uh many developing countries achieving independence particularly in this area we felt that you know yah we we started this pointing special yah we started pointed fingers at others you owe us this you need to do this for us and i i'm reminded actually when i was in jakarta last week i had the same example i used i was reminded by a javanese that you know when you point a finger someone it's only one finger but with three others pointing pointing yourself yes yourself well i was told by this javanese that in in the malay or indonesian way of pointing a finger is this way where you point one finger at others but four inside fingers pointing at yourself and i and we start thinking that you know is that really worthwhile every time pointing fingers at others but let me quickly add to say that the malay muslim community has never been uhm short on uh self-help activities but uhm it took sometime before we felt that we must work within the national framework yes and and in the eighties when we felt we formed mendeki in fact it's a combination of many years of social activism which bought the various groups together and i think uhm mendeki has shown what we can achieve and what we can do if we sink our differences put our shoulders to the wheel and mind you hard work real hard work must come with it and and i made an example may may may i cut in yes may i cut in on this one you mention one phase which caught uh which caught my ears sink our differences are there really significant differences or superficial differences within the community well our history has been filled with that and fortunately we came to realise that you know we just cannot go on uh with all this differences and i think unity is i think is uh critical and i'm glad we have that now more than before and that way we can actually maximise our resources i would like to sort of uh put something to you which may be a misconception uh on the part of many people in singapore including myself that's that there is a perception of the fundamental conflict between religion the islamic religion of the islam and modernity if you agree that adjustments uh and accommodation have to be made between these two factors whether it is in fact uh possible to make successful uh uh integration in the long term can i uh preface my answer to that question by adding a point to my earlier answer and to say that there are problems i hope i have not painted a too rosy a picture about uh the process of upliftment and to say that there are problems and one of the problems is this question of reconciling differences in terms of perception yes i think there's a serious gulf of perception between the malays non-malays and muslims non-muslims and the it's not because of religion but it's because of how muslims practice their religion if i may cite an example i was in libya in nineteen seventy-three i was a student there and i was invited to attend an international conference and we went there happily looking forward to a model of islam a simple answer yes looking for a simple answer in fact in fact it was proposed that uhm communism had failed capitalism had failed and the answer is the third international theory called the green book islam oh yes yes i read about that yes and uh but i must say that we came back very disillusioned very disappointed because even at that very conference we saw those contradictions we saw those uhm weaknesses and mind you that's within the fold of islamic brotherhood within the fold of islamic conference youth conference full of hopes and expectations and i that made me feel why is it that we muslims in singapore must always look to one particular area be it middle east or somewhere else yes for that reference points i agree that the cradle word of islamic realisation was mecca and for a long time middle east was in fact the reference point but we are different we are urban we are industrial we are global but i'm not saying that we we don't have those cultural and religious pools whether in the region or in the context of the international omma the muslim yes but i think uh with our own uh needs and our own challenges we must find new reference points which will provide us those kind of answers where is more relevant to our need i'm not saying that uh they are so many islam there is only one islam yes but let me also add to say that why is it that we have differences in in practices in all over the muslim world but okay okay we got to take a commercial break now but i like to leave something with you uh we can chat about it uh later on uhm perhaps what i'm trying to to to put to you is that surely there is not a zero sum game as far as this is concerned i i would imagine that even within the the boundaries of the islamic faith uh one doesn't have to consider that if you in fact uh exist and succeed in the secular society you do have to trade off something uh we'll come back to you later on and don't go away now we'll be back and where i'm gonna put that question to zainal once again see you later welcome back before we took the commercial break i was putting the question to zanial as to whether religion and modernity is a zero sum game may i have your views on this one zainal let me say that it must be a win win situation for us there's no other way there will be difference some matter of perception some reality and uh i think we got to learn to manage those differences i say a win win situation because islam calls for modernity islam calls for progress and islam calls for tolerance you know islam is a very multi-cultural society in fact and i think uh i'd see no reason why islam cannot uh succeed in a secular state like singapore and i would like to say that singapore gives us all the challenges to be good muslims it's not gonna be easy but the challenges are there and it's up to us actually to work this is a very interesting set of uh facts why is it that the people in general don't seem to know these i mean from appearance anyway and from what one hear as in these these not the issues that are often front-ended to any discussion uh one tends to see much more uh uh back to the nature sort of thing but why why is that so well i think uhm there is historical baggage we can't deny that whether for cultural reasons racial reasons or religious reasons there have been those there have been those times where it it really does not help but uhm i'm optimistic and i'm confident that we will be able to make some headway we have been making headway and i think there's better willingness on the part both or both malays non-malay muslims and non-muslims to reach out and learn from each other let me site one another example if you don't mind bob please please do i went to a forum yes and i was on the panel and i was uh a chinese gentleman stood up and say you know what the problem with you all is that you are muslims if you are malays you are alright can you imagine that does he really know what this is i i mean i thought at first it was very uh facetious but i thought and thought about it and i thought that this it reflects a very serious problem because i think quite a lot of non-malays here see malays as very gentle very easy going people but how did they look at islam how do they look at muslims perhaps overseas fundamentalists radical militant they're the guys who grab the headlines problems everywhere i mean they're the guys who grab the the headlines you see but there could be a certain amount of concern a certain amount of uh ignorance uhm perhaps this is the gulf that m u i s uh uh would you see this to be uh uh a gulf that m u i s should attempt to address you know i if i may again uh site another anecdote you know i remember when the debate about g r c was on and i remember if i'm not mistaken that captain ho who had made a submission and was saying that we should not go for g r c because it gave the malays or the minority groups a certain political leverage and i remember senior minister or prime minister then you know prime minister you ask him where do you live i think is was hougang if i am not mistaken and he said do you have malay friends do you know the malays and the muslims and he said no and i think that's the point and i feel uh the more of muslims reach out to understand what the others feel and similarly the if more non-muslims try to reach out and understand how muslims and malays feel i think there can be that greater uh understanding zanial if i may out to push you a little bit on the last comment that you made i would like to share with you perhaps rightly or wrongly two perceptions first is that the malay community uh has been marginalised in the development of the singapore society the other thing is that ever since singapore's independence some thirty-eight odd years ago the rest of the society has in fact moved forward do you think that the last thirty years have been wasted marginalised may be too strong a word you know i remember that quite a number of malay friends of mine who were very upset when uh we say that the malays were not in the mainstream they feel that the malays have been part of the mainstream yes 
Singapore	welcome to the programme mister david marshall thank you may i sort of begin our conversation by drawing on one of the uhm the comments that you made in the short video clip uh just at that before it concluded have the years indeed mellowed you well the fire in the belly is embers now but it can always be fan to flame by injustice i have a deep emotional desire for human justice uh a deep feeling for respect for my fellow human beings that has not altered my capacity to seek to develop these ideas into a practical improvement of conditions of course is very much less and with age a few windows closed you have held some very strong views of what you feel singapore and singaporean should be and the if i may uh take the liberty of quoting an interview from an interview you had in nineteen eighty-eight uhm you said and if i may quote you mister marshall we have not come of age we are adolescents we have ability but no grace we exaggerate our importance and forget that we are no more than a pinpoint on the globe we have a long way to go and i heard that we go that road in humility i think these are sentiments word  what drove you to express those opinions in nineteen eighty-eight well the the realities of the situation then i was seeking to tell our people look this is how it is today but because there are defects this is how it can be improved whether i was right or wrong is irrelevant i was honest about it and let's be fair in the last eight years i think we've taken a giant step i was until thursday i was dean of the commonwealth ambassadors in paris and there were every month we had lunch and i meet about twenty-three twenty-four ambassadors most of them from the third world and the respect for singapore was a joy a real joy so we're no longer an uh irrelevant pinpoint we are a very relevant a global city that's a long way to go as for graciousness in my embassy i get officers constantly changing and my impression is that the officers who have come to paris recently are far more sophisticated with a a growing sense of the graciousness of living uh my minister wong kan seng gave me a dinner to farewell me he and his misses wong brigadier-general yeo and his wife heads of government depart all the departments of the foreign office and a beautiful silver word to farewell me ten years ago eight years ago that would not have happened spending public money on a function that produced no money but he understood the meaning uh and the worth the worthwhileness of a gracious act that's important yes yes but but sorry for interrupting but would this be applicable generally to all singaporeans i mean we still see a lot of grabbing out we still see many manifestations of self-interest and surely that is that goes against the uh the the perception of gracious to be honest uh not self-interest self-interest is part of human nature you know mao zi tong tried to change it and failed no no no let let's get our picture right yes we are the new ridge okay uh yes we haven't got the sophistication fully yet but we are getting there our people are a very decent people and a very reasonable people and frankly i'm delighted to be born in singapore i like them they've been wonderful to me so when you talk of graciousness yes there's a lot of uh scrabbling for money yes it's it's a i think it's the fault of the government they keep insisting on merit and and and uh uhm merit is uh expressed in uh the medals in my chest and the money in my bank account but uh let's be fair again you know the other night community chest centre i had goh chok tong speak of compassion and solidarity we're coming along i mean george yeo last week was it uh he put forward uh uh a very heroic plan for uh development for cultural activity of our people so i see these glimmers uh of our understanding that now we have filled the rice bowl we must move on to the quality of living beyond our physical needs and frankly as i see our people they enjoy they like they appreciate and they accept uh tendencies to greater respect for the human individual for the graces of living for the grace of human relations i'm i'm i'm not uh i'm not pessimistic i'm much more optimistic today than i was eight years ago wouldn't there be any pitfalls that we have got to be worried about there are two challenges one is racial harmony and look i i'm a critic of the p a p but in fairness they have done a wonderful job of softening antagonisms of fair play for all communities and so long as this tradition lasts of respect for minority groups and there is respect for minor then we're alright there is an emphasis too great an emphasis but then maybe i'm unsingaporean in this on money values for me you know i say after eighty-five years of living i believe that human relations are far far more satisfying than the money in my bank and the medals on my chest and there i have them yes i'm afraid we got to go for a short break now mister marshall but before we go i will just like to uh leave you with a thought that in view of the present stage of development of singapore we are subject to more open influences and one of those uh influences that are now prevade that is now prevading the world is this question of human rights and human freedom individual freedom but uh we'll take a break now and we'll come back and take up this question don't go away now we'll be back to discuss and continue with this conversation that's a global question welcome back before we took the break mister marshall i raised the point of human rights and personal freedom i think this is a point which confronts a lot of those of us in singapore when we read about the sort of word that go on internationally but what exactly how do you see this question of human rights that's a global question affects more than singapore as i see it historically the asian approach is founded on confucian thought mainly two thousand five hundred years ago confucius had such giant task of trying to bring order to a chaos across the vast country so he evolved a philosophy which is quite essential for the time to bring order is a philosophy of primacy of the community's welfare yes respect for authority legitimate though it was for the time and place it has led to imperial repression it has led to communist repression it is the father of dictatorships because of course who is the judge of the community's welfare except our bosses and they love the idea respect authority and uh if they don't have opposition as because as these majesty uh they they they lose a sight of the real individual's welfare and it therefore emphasis on community's interest exclusively is unhealthy at least to dictatorship and authoritarian rule on the other side of the world the western nations were leaven by the pseudo christian concept of respect for the individual and from the concept of respect for the individual flowed democracy and democracy gave freedom to grow to his full height and what a magnificent achievement compare the result of the two culture but let's face it excess of individualism has meant fragmentation it has meant uh egoism run word riot uh it has meant uh uh quite unpleasant results in many parts especially in the united states which are so high so openly advertised i see the picture as one where we must marry the two concepts there must be both respect for community welfare as a framework and respect for the individual and perhaps more respect for the individual than emphasis on the community's welfare and frankly i i i i see this government rather uh you think it's coming together here there is an attempt in singapore it's slow-moving uh it's hesitant but there's a slow-moving away from excessive community emphasis on community welfare to movement to respect for the individual yes i'd like to live longer enough to see the result of this experiment maybe we can show the world how to do it you feel that all the necessary ingredients are in fact in place we have an intelligent government we have reasonably perceptive government even if they sometime seem repressive and authoritarian they're not stupid uh they know what we're about and uh frankly it's more than a question of vote getting i believe they're totally sincere in seeking our welfare i mean they're integrity shows it and uh yes i think that the ingredient are here the evolution may be slow but maybe a cautious approach is a wise one of quiet evolution yes yes of course one is evidently influenced by the accesses one could see in other societies where this thing has gone a little out of hand but perhaps we can uh uh sort of uh uh come down to the next level or so to speak of of of uh individual freedom which is of course uhm another difficult uh area to touch on mister iau when my friends speak about that i say tell me where are we lacking in freedom what freedom are we lacking in wow they say have you become p a p i said look i'm not pro p a p i seek to have a sense of balance an honest balance look every time i come back to singapore i feel like rig and wrinkle asleep for decades and suddenly i say is this colossal city my singapore are these vibrant dynamic people with vision and courage my fellow citizens how is this happen here in forty years you know why do we have to emphasis the pimples on our face instead of looking and praising the magnificent rippling muscles of our olympic athlete's body you know i won't to refuse to kiss a beautiful woman if she has a pimple on her face if i can have a government that is honest and they are honest if i can have a government that's able look around you even benjay ratnam will have to confess they are able if i can have a government that's caring and i think it's moving that way beyond the caring for the general welfare and uh rice bowl caring for the human individual and his own weaknesses well i'm a very lucky man look i'm not perfect i mean i've got sort of applying for a halo why should i expect my ministers to be perfect sure they make silly blunders i mean for for me that's business about chewing gum honestly that embarrassed me acutely how could they how could these very able people discern to such an absurdity how could you use a forty pound hammer to crack a walnut uh okay so they make mistakes they make uh blunders but what is the overall picture like the overall picture makes me proud to be a singapore unfortunately the publicity is all on our the pimples on our face and i would frankly uh to have a session with our university students who complain in the dark you know uh ruthless uh whatever okay tell me where do we lack in freedom we've got a declaration of human rights by by by the united nations which paragraph have we transgressed have we violated yes  let's have it openly don't be afraid for heaven sake what are you afraid of if you're honest what are you afraid of has any honest man gone to jail 
Singapore	good morning i am christina eng in am singapore today conservation by private home owners a new constitution for south africa and consultancy work in the library services if you think your home is of historical or architectural importance you could get help to conserve it the urban redevelopment authority or ura is starting a scheme called conservation initiated by private owners basically this means that if you're if you own a building which you think is worth preserving the ura may offer help such as reaping redevelopment charges usually conservation projects are initiated by the ura so why then do they want private owners to make the first move now koh eng jin manager of the ura conservation and urban design unit explains to loh wee chin no we all know that uhm besides the that areas that has been gazetted for conservation and the additional areas uhm announced today uhm throughout the entire island there are other buildings either in groups or in a on a street block basis which has architectural and historical merit worthy of conservation now we would like to encourage owners who own such property to come forward to ura and say i have a building i think it has merit and it it is worthy to be considered for conservation and i like to participate in this conservation scheme and we would help to facilitate to make an assessment and evaluation of the building and if it's found worthy of conservation we can then facilitate the owners to go through the process of having their properties gazetted for conservation but many owners might not even realise that their buildings are worth conserving after all they might just think it's a dirty old building how would they know if uhm what they live in or what they work in is worth conserving now we have a pamphlet that has been published and within the pamphlet the we gave an idea of what has been our past effort so that will in a way inform the public to you know in a way they can look at all the buildings that has been gazetted and in fact we do have a good number for numbers of building that has been restored so i think the owners could use that as a point of reference to to evaluate in fact whether their building is worthy of conservation so you mean just like say walk around singapore and see what has been conserved already and see if their own building matches up yes i think precisely they can walk around town and they can see the buildings being beautifully restored in fact uhm i think most of us would not be able to realise that how beautiful the buildings are because they have not been maintained over the years they look very run-down but if you look at those buildings that has already been restored you will discover that the beauty that you have never you know realised before how many people have uhm come have offered their building for conservation so far voluntarily up to date we do receive a lot of enquiries each month we get about a hundred enquiries to enquire whether their buildings are worthy of conservation uhm and we do have instances where the owners came forward and they say i think my building is worthy of conservation and we have encouraged them to conserve in fact there is one such case it at mayer road a bungalow house victorian style bungalow the plot of land under the master plan is allowed to redevelop as an apartment now the owner has conserved the bungalow and next to the bungalow he has uhm proposed a block of apartments and he can use his bungalow for communal facilities or even redesign the interior of the bungalow to make them into apartment units koh eng jin on the conservation of private houses still to come on am singapore proposal for a new constitution in south africa and a look at the new shell marketing centre south african president f.w. de klerk has proposed a constitution that will for the first time in the country history give blacks the right to vote it however denies them political domination instead it ensures black-white par sharing through all levels of government the plan will also see the creation of two houses in parliament the first house would be made up of elected representatives proportionate to their party's share of votes the second house which will have veto powers over the first will be made up of an equal number of representatives from south africa's nine regions the south african i'm sorry the african national congress south africa's biggest black political grouping has rejected the model claiming it would result in a weak parliament they also believe that the system of power-sharing would effectively give whites the veto but are these things valid or is the anc simply piqued at the prospect of never having majority rule a short while ago sansita badachajee was on the line with saer govinder a journalist based in johannesburg shia asked him first whether there was any significance in the timing of the proposed constitution you see over the past uh few months the right-wing in south africa has been carrying out a uhm an intensive campaign against the national party accusing the national party of selling out to white people in the country and of a giving in to majority rule and of giving in to anc and so i think de klerk in order to in order to try to uhm you know dilute or defuse the the opposition against him uhm you know as as reveal the constitutional proposals which uh which in a way what you call tries to provide some kind of security for the white people and and and the he hopes that in this way that he will be able to soothe the nerves and the fears of the of the white minority but of course you know the conservative party has also rejected the de klerk's constitutional proposals and has once again accused him of uh leading the country to uhm to black majority rule so you  laugh so you see that uh de klerk uhm uh you know while while trying to win the support of the right-wing he's he's still being you know criticized and condemned by the right-wing well de klerk doesn't seem to have much luck with the anc either they've rejected his proposal but why have they done so and what are they looking for in in this new draft constitution the anc believes firstly that it it wants a word  parliament whereby what you call the first chamber will be elected on a one-person one-vote system which which is also uhm you know proposed by the national party and that uh the representation in the first house of parliament will be by proportional representation and the both the national party and the anc support that but the only difference is that the anc does agree with the national party insofar as the second chamber the devolution of power to the regions and the the uh granting of more power to the people who own properties rather than people who don't own properties uhm the the anc believes that these are all mechanisms being contrived by the national party in order to deny the the majority party in any future and free elections to to form the government and to what you call operate freely without any uh restrictions uhm president de klerk has said that not all blacks supported the anc and that he claims that millions and millions of blacks bet his party in preventing too much power in the hands of one party or one leader is this claim an empty one well that's what he likes to believe i mean uh for instance uh i i mean he uh the the the the incata zulu party does not support the anc but the incata zulu party uhm is just to uh achieve popularity and the and some of his people i mean they don't have the majority support of all the zulus i mean uh president de klerk would like to believe that uh millions of blacks support him but i mean the only way that uh uh we could uh we could come to a situation where where political parties uhm registered and supported by is is through free and fray elections and this is what uh the anc and other progressive organisations in south africa are calling for mr govinder on the demands of the african national congress regarding the new constitution yesterday the congress of people's deputies and the ussr rejected a draft of the union treaty sending it back to the drawing board for more discussion this came about after russia and the ukraine submitted further amendments to the original bill russian president boris yeltsin in the last minute move surprised law-makers with an alternative proposal for setting up the much debated confederation yeltsin claimed that the proposed legislative body would leave russia with a minority voice in a transitional parliament dominated by conservative governments of other republics but why has yeltsin made his proposal at such a last minute just when congress was set to vote on it a question pek siok lian asked civitologist tron gilberg earlier this morning  tg  but how do you think the congress and the republics will respond to his proposal what about gorbachev then how do you think he is likely to react tg  well uhm the russian republic word has also threatened to secede should the full-scale legislature not agree to their alternative proposal how great an influence will this threat have on the response of gorbachev and the other republics do you think  tg  so civitologist tron gilberg bringing the time to three nine minutes past seven here on am singapore with the opening of its hundred and fifteen million dollar marketing centre oil company shell has a three billion dollar stake in singapore the installation takes over the inland distribution function of products like petrol and diesel it's linked to the pulau bukom refinery by submarine pipelines which makes it possible to transport 2000 tons of oil in 6 to 7 hours an operation which used to take a whole day the centre also boasts of being environment-friendly shell's marketing director sim siok lim describes to jane ong some of the technology employed to achieve this such as double bottom tanks all the tanks uh sit on a a second bottom which is made of a a thick membrane uh of plastic material and this thick membrane is actually laid in the ground uh beneath the foundation of the tank themselves for the tanks are built uh and there are the membrane is so designed that should there be a leak of any of the tank the oil does not seep beyond the top of this membrane so that from that point of view it is it's safe you also have uhm an equipment called the total ball plate interceptor which cost more than one million dollars what does that do as you know in uh oil in installation of this nature before any water flows out of the installation uh all the drain water and surface water uh has to be channelled through uh an approved uh design of interceptor to make sure that any oil that's present in the water is separated from the water before the water is allowed to exit the installation now for this installation we have actually incorporated into it a the latest design of such interceptor and that is called a tutable plate interceptor the feature of this filtable plate interceptor is that uh it has the capability of uh streaming off as it were uh the oil so deeply that the effluent water that eventually flows out has has got an absolute minimal amount of oil present in it if any at all  you also have uhm bottom loading siligentries what is that supposed to do how safe is that for the environment the bottom loading of tank trucks is the uh the latest method for loading tank trucks the advantage of bottom loading as uh against the uh more conventional method of loading uh tank trucks via the top is that in bottom loading we are able to construct a vapour return line to the storage tanks and in that way as we load the tank trucks no vapour escapes into the surrounding atmosphere are there any other safety measures that you've built into this installation to make sure that it it is environmentally friendly yes indeed uh other safety measures uh would include the way that the submarine pipelines are are designed and constructed for instance and uh the pipelines for instance are are laid well below uh psa's reserved taps uh for the channels through which the pieplines pass uh the pipelines are also protected by a very thick layer of of rock armoury uh which is designed to prevent uh accidental uh dragging by anchors and uh this layer of armoury is designed to withstand accidental dragging by anchors of ships up to a quarter million tons in dead weight sim siok lim talking about the environment friendly measures at the new shell marketing centre many private organisations have a need to develop in-house libraries for their own specific needs but most try to do it themselves using their own unqualified staff salary turner a library service consultant does not advocate such a practice she gives her reasons why so what services does a library consultant provide and how can these small organisations get started and that was salary turner once again we've come to the end of our programme so on behalf of  i'm christina eng seng bye for now 
Singapore	in am singapore today president bush intends to send planes to iraq we ask if he's over-reacting and more varied eca programs for our schools what do the principals think all these and more in the next twenty minutes hello i'm shanji dabaracharji disbelief outrage and anger that's how iraq has reacted to the news that president bush had authorised us military forces to escort united nations' team inspecting iraqi weapon sites the forces are now on alert ready to be sent if iraq shows no flexibility over conditions over which un teams can be allowed to inspect the sites the american leader however has said that he did not expect action to be necessary against iraq the announcement came amid confusion about whether the united states had definitely decided to send additional air forces to saudi arabia president bush had said that the aircraft could be used to provide cover for un inspection teams searching for weapons of mass destruction however as no one had expected the iraqis to hand details of their security forces over on on a silver platter did president bush then exhaust all possibilities or were there other options he overlooked durik kipper is a research scholar specialising on us-iraq affairs with the american think-tank brooklyn institution  dk  well according to the un secretary general the iraqis had been showing some signs of flexibility and only last week they had backed down over the use of their helicopters do you think that perhaps president bush has over-reacted  dk  the un inspection team that has been in iraq has discovered that iraq's weapon capability is at a much higher stage than anyone expected do you think that this this discovery has influenced america's decision to some extent  dk  well the iraqis have been rather creative in hiding their military equipment even if force was to be used do you think that iraq can be stripped of its military potential durik kipper of the brooklyn institution on the line from america and from the possibility of fighting iraq team once again to a country split by a long-running violence in yugoslavia the warring factions appears to have ignored the cease-fire which came into effect at six o'clock yesterday in fact fighting is reported in many areas the broker of this present cease-fire former british foreign secretary lord carrington has asked for twenty-four hours before writing off this attempt adrian ong asks professor adney berlonski on whether they should write up the cease-fire or whether they should give time as lord carrington suggested  ab  croatia's defence minister has just resigned today uh presumably because there are some differences in lieu do you see a split in word over how they should deal with the serbians  ab  how much longer do you think the croatian army can hold out against the yugoslavia's federal forces before giving in to serbian demands ab  you spoke earlier about a split in zagreb is there a similar split in serbia  ab  this is the fourth attempt at cease-fighting croatia has the past relationship between the croats and the serbs been so bitter that they simply cannot trust each other  ab  professor adney bolongski on the line from london and the time now is seven twenty-three coming up next here in am singapore investing in germany to encourage investment in the five eastern states of germany the german government is providing a high level of financial support while the federal government gives incentives through taxation and the price of real estate local governments provide support through local structures and facilities this same support is given to all investors both domestic and foreign but wouldn't this put german companies at an advantage given that they speak the same language and share a similar culture doctor henning forsherald president of the word  or the other house of parliament agrees but he gives but he gives christina eng the reasons for doing so  hf  well we have had uhm previous calls for investment in east germany but so far no single singaporean investment has been made what do you think is hold singapore investors back  hf  well you're trying to promote uh german investment in the eastern states but you're also trying trying to promote german investment in the asian pacific why  hf  doctor henning forsherald president of the word next on am singapore eca programs for our schools four hundred principals gathered at the eca seminar yesterday to examine the policies and future directions for extra-curricular activities in singapore schools they hope to develop a rich and varied eca program that will add colour to school life and help students build character and achieve personal growth dr tay eng soon senior minister of state for education was the guest at honour at the seminar yesterday karen won asked him wouldn't that wouldn't putting more emphasis on eca be adding pressure on the child i don't think so uh my observation is that those students who really do well uh in life are people who have uh good academic certificates but who also have a good eca track record uh they manage to do both and in fact some of them tell me that because of their eca activities uhm uh they are able to relax they're even able to do better in their academic work you know they don't become stale in other words what about the slower students who are already having problem coping with their uh formal curriculum well i think the balance has been struck at every level but it is possible even at for average students to pay attention to both and do better uhm just imagine a student who is not very good in his studies and you do nothing but lock him up in a room to do his studies right do you think that student will somehow improve in his studies i think he will become very bored very stale his mind will be switched off but if you allow him daily to have a little bit of uhm uh healthy sporting activity his mind will be refreshed i think he'll come back to his studies with more interest what would you tell parents who think that eca is robbing their children's studying time i would advise them that uhm they should think of the total development of their children uh there are many examples of children who do extremely well in their academic studies who later on in life do not do well uh in the sense that their personalities are incomplete they lack self-confidence uhm and even though they may have got good grades they are not effective as adults and that's a real pity if they had uh balanced programs in school where studies on one hand is important but uh at the same time they give make effort in eca uh in eca activities and develop their character their personality i think they make more successful adults and that was dr tay eng soon talking about the importance of eca his view is shared by two principals mr jumaat mazdawood of clementi town primary and mrs pearl goh from ping yi secondary school in this report zainal abidin they will be implementing this new vision of eca in their schools mr jumaat mazdawud said that the suggestion of offering a wider exposure of eca is especially best for primary school students he believes that these students should be exposed to a variety of eca so that they could make a more prudent choice of what to specialise in at the secondary school level and this means opening up the extra-curricular activities to lower primary school students as well however in this case there would be some restrictions it is quite obvious that uh if we were to allow the lower primary pupils access to eca it must be some kind of activity where it may not be too strenuous for them 'cos uh their body structure i think limits the the kind of activities that are available to them but i do believe pupils at primary two or even at primary one if they do have the the the uh need and that that interest uh together with parental support uh in eca activities such as uh music uh dancing uh and a host of others which uhm may be of interest to these younger pupils they should be given all help and all assistance to participate in these kind of activities the range of activities and research will include the more specialised ones such as mountaineering ballet sea sport and music that's very much in demand now in such cases professional help would be necessary and this would mean a definite increase in the cost of running eca programs who'd pay for this increase in costs now hopefully with the release of medisave parents may now find it a little bit easier to group together via the school system uh to employ maybe specialised instructors uh which may be available outside uh the school system and which we can more or less work together uh to garner these resources for the benefit of the pupils at present the schools are subsidising almost all the activities that are provided in the schools but if they were to engage more specialised instructors it would imply that or rather it would mean that the cost of instruction would go up and uh for a school with limited funds to embark on such a project i would expect uh some input uh to be allowed uh from on the part of parents to subsidise or part of the the training program for the pupils in ensuring that cost of the eca program do not go up unnecessarily mrs pearl goh principal of ping yi secondary school said she would rely on a wide-ranging skills of the teachers in improving her school's eca programs this she said would also reduce the undue stress of the teachers if they have to learn and instruct new skills not familiar to them what we do in ping yi is to exploit potential within our teachers they come actually loaded with gifts and skills it's a matter of finding out and deploying them so what we try to offer the students uh areas that the teachers could offer in terms of let's say an enrichment program uh teaching japanese or teaching the boys how to cook and manage a home uhm plastic making artifacts these are some of the things that my teachers have so i've not gone to any extra expense of having them trained we pick out these and then we try to structure program for the students but pearl admitted undoubtedly there will be an increase in the eca expense if we are going to provide a more generous spread of activities to the students according to her eca expenditure that exceeds the 500 dollars a year given by the ministry of education is covered through her hard work of getting donations from organisations like the shaw foundation and when i ask her what more she thinks the ministry should offer she said well i feel that the ministry of education could provide some of the more expensive items for example in some health clubs they've this very sophisticated machinery where you could have a a group of students at the different posts uhm keeping fit at the same time i would love to have word and this machinery and support uh machinery for the children to do to keep fit on rainy days for example when they can't do their p.e. outside they could go to this room and the teachers and and and i could also enjoy it finally when asked if she foresees any problem in implementing this new expanded eca program she confidently replied you give us the machinery we will schedule it i think principals are known to be very very creative and very innovative mrs pearl goh so it looks like students at all levels can look forward to a more enriching eca program in the years to come and with that we've come to the end of today's program on behalf of my producer adrain ong i'm shanji dabaracharji join us again tommorrow at seven fifteen am over radio one till then have a nice day 
Singapore	on am singapore we'll be exploring the approach to this year's speak mandarin campaign five ways to save the environment and a french minister's view on trade and tariffs good morning i'm elynur nair but first patriotic missiles have been deployed to saudi arabia from the united states along with one thousand three hundred soldiers trained to use them this comes at a time when tension is high in the region where iraq continues to detain the un team hunting for evidence of its nuclear programs so far only two of the us-gulf war allies have responded to the situation the british and israeli prime ministers have both called for the destruction of iraq's nuclear capabilities other allies especially the middle-easterns are keeping quiet on this issue to find out why christina eng calls dr paul rogers of bradford univerisity earlier this morning  pr  but by keeping quiet can they defuse the tension it doesn't help any does it  pr  well saudi arabia is getting ready for a major crisis by accepting the patriot missiles at this time does this mean that uhm it is taking sides with the us  pr  well if them no eastern allies don't want to take sides can they be relied on to rally around the us once again should force be decided on by the security council  pr  that was dr paul rogers on support for the us from its allies the time now is nineteen minutes past seven and next we look at news occurring on the home front speak mandarin in mandarin well it's that time of the year again to brush up on your mandarin that is if you're a chinese singaporean and haven't been speaking mandarin for the twelve years the campaign's been on if you're one of them the organisers hope that this time round chinese mythological figures a lighthearted approach and even some humour will convince you to speak more mandarin and through it better appreciate chinese culture for the theme this year is that mandarin is more than just a language this is a change from last year's slogan if you're a chinese make a statement in mandarin that raised quite a few eyebrows with that in mind how careful have the organisers been to avoid another issue deputy director of publicity and promotions at the ministry of information and the arts henry ng explains  word in this year we're taking a different approach the approach we take is a light-hearted approach it won't be offending anybody we want to appeal to people's urge to learn the chinese culture and chinese heritage through the use of mandarin that means if you know mandarin you speak mandarin you appreciate chinese culture better have you taken soundings from the other committees to see if the they feel that this year's slogan is perhaps uhm as sensitive as last year's i think uh in the committee to promote the use of mandarin we have uh members who are english educated their views have been sought and they have given an input uh in coming out with this slogan so i think that this year's slogan won't be as controversial as the past year where have you consulted uhm members from the other committees i think we do uh we have consulted uh other mps uh and also through the mps to tell uh community so i am confident that this year's slogan should be acceptable to all this year's campaign like that of the past couple of years has tended to equate the learning of mandarin with the learning of chinese culture uh it there a danger over the years that the mandarin campaign has lost its initial objective of replacing dialects instead of replacing english i think our basic aim is still the same uh we try to get people to speak more mandarin instead of dialects then how do you explain some of the activities during the campaign like encouraging government office to speak uh mandarin to chinese singaporeans regardless of whether they uh whether they can speak english or not as the the survey uh reveals we have more and more chinese singaporeans speaking uh man mandarin in fact even though the chinese singaporeans may not uh completely speak fluent mandarin but they'll understand it and uh they can speak some of it but only that uh they may not feel too comfortable in doing so uh again i'm not uh saying that we are trying to replace english with mandarin but if they are already familiar with the language and they know a little bit of it then if they practice more they will speak better that is the idea the prime minister said last week that the government will begin to pay more attention to the chinese educated segments of society uhm has this new policy affected the way in which this campaign will be carried perhaps with more intensity i think the budget uh of the campaign is fixed we have people uh sponsor activities during the campaign month but all in all we won't be able to uh spend too much uh on media because campaign budget is fixed that was henry ng of mita talking to adrian ong about this year's speak mandarin campaign that'll be launched this coming monday night ambassador-at-large professor tommy koh has said that singapore will continue to rely on oil and gas until further energy becomes commercially attractive addressing the seventh asia-pacific petroleum conference yesterday he gave five suggestions whereby singapore can use energy more efficiently and thus help the environment professor koh who's also chairman of the preparatory committee of the united nations conference on environment and development told jane ong what his five ideas are first i will like to see the ministry of the environment working together with the national council on the environment and the consumers uh uh association to promote green consumerism what i mean is to educate the public so that the public will behave in a more environmentally responsible way such as switching from ordinary light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs and uh buying fuel efficient cars fuel efficient refrigerators air-conditioners uh second i will like to see our architects design buildings which are more suited to our climate you know buildings which are not intended for air-conditioning should have more shade and cross ventilation then third i will like to see uh the air-conditioning engineers do a better job than they do now at the moment many of our indoor spaces are over-conditioned uh the other thing i want to suggest is that uh the pub should see how it can increase the thermal efficiency at their power plants which at the moment is about 40 per cent which means that 60 per cent of the heat generated has been lost finally i would uh like to commend the government for making provisions in its concept plan for bike way but i want on behalf of the cyclists in singapore to make the point that at the moment our streets are unsafe for cycling and i think there is no better way of transport than uh the bicycle because it's a non-polluting uh vehicle how do you think we can actually put pressure on uhm the concerned for these and parties for example the cyclists' pathways and in encouraging people to rely less on air-conditioning how do you think we can actually move these things on a much faster pace well the ministry of the environment is intending in fact to uh initiate the campaign on green consumerism uh and i think that the non-governmental organisations you know like uh the nature society the national council of the environment uh the ministry education uh our junior colleges or schools i think that and and and an environmentally jour journalist you know that was recently uh formed uh a forum of uh environmental journalists in singapore i think that these people should come together to educate the public i i don't think you know it is helpful in singapore to take a confrontational attitude towards government and if it's unnecessary anyway because the ministry of the environment is in fact taking the lead in many fields you know so i think what we need to do is work together with the ministry of the environment the ministry education on an industrial level how do you think environmentalists or an environment concerned people in singapore can work with the oil industry for example which is so important here to ensure that uhm we have a safe a good clean environment i think that the national council of the environment uh should and the nature's society should have a dialogue with the leaders of our oil industry uh and uh i would myself like to promote such a dialogue are you happy with what the oil industry has been now uh i think the leadership of the major oil in uh companies we have are in fact uh very responsive to the environmental concern so i would say yes professor tommy koh on saving energy and saving the environment the french minister of trade for foreign affairs mr word  said that france is committed to the success of talks under the general agreement on trade and tariffs along with the other members of the european community france has has been accused of snagging the five year word round of great gatt talks they've been criticised for refusing to cut back on subsidies to its farmers with gatt talks resuming next month many of its members are not optimistic that a conclusion would be reached before the end of the year jane ong asked mr who was here for a two-day visit if he holds the same view so will france's conviction for this uhm talks to be successfully concluded will that conviction include even giving in on the issue of the farm subsidies which has been described as the stumbling block so far and that was mr the french minister of trade for foreign affairs who left singapore for paris last night and coming up next on am singapore making a phone call from the air singapore airlines passenger will no longer have to wait before landing to make a phone call sia has just launched a new air to ground phone service called cetestial that can be used by its long-distance passengers we join shangi barachargi on her first attempt at making the celestial phone call hello i'm shangi barachargi i'm calling you from thirty-five thousand feet above south china sea through celestial sia's new service for its passengers able to reach anywhere in the world the service will be available on all sia's long-distance flights by 1994 now sitting next to me is sia's marketing uh director of marketing services mr joseph chew good morning mr chew now mr chew celestial looks like a rather ordinary cordless telephone but how does the system actually work well the celestial is the high phone service from sia and it works quite simply via satellite you make a call from the cabin word via the satellite through to the ground telecommunicative system through three outstations like word in the uk word  in norway and sentosa in singapore now this phone call is costing us about 15 singapore dollars for every minute even this rate's rather steep for the average uhm passenger well we have looked into this cost but really the element of cost uh does not arise because this is a service that we are providing to passengers uh and we believe that this is an integral part of service that we want to extend to enhance our service how many people do you see using this service and who will they be we do not know exactly how many passengers would like to use it but we figure it would be very popular among the business people business travellers and even the family man who's travelling on board  now only a fifteen singapore dollars is rather steep is there a possibility of introducing an off-peak pricing system at the moment we're not sure whether there will be an off-peak uh rate uh all we can say is that the rate is calculated word a very nominal basis now uh i understand that this is a first of sia's uhm new services to to developing a total visit centre for its passengers now the other thing is back and the date transition centres when do you see this coming on line well celestial is the first uh first at stage next we believe we will introduce the fax services and real time uh news financial services and health services probably in two within two years uh it seems that we're running out of time at the moment so we have to end the interview there thank you very much mr chew for your company and so with that i'm here on sq 888 with elnor nair and chirstina eng back in the studio and that was with how you could sound like at thirty nine thousand feet in the clouds well with that it's time to come down to earth i'm alna nair with producer christian eng and we'll be back again tomorrow with am singapore if you happen to be at one of those flights at seven fifteen am why not give us a call at 3503676 that's 3503676 
Singapore	good evening the people's action party led by mr goh chok tong who assumed premiership just ten years ago was returned to power when nominations closed at twelve thirty p.m. today it's the ninth successive victory for the pap in the general election our special report tonight give detail gives details of the walkovers and fights in the constituencies the major statements of party leaders at their press conferences and finally an analysis of the issues by three political commentators no one could have expected the general election so soon in fact the opposition calls it the snappiest of snap election but mr goh says he wants an endorsement now for his style of government and his program he says he is the issue and the ground is sweet well who will be contesting who has already won what's the score like at the end of nomination day the pap has a lot to cheer about its mr goh chok tong's first general election as prime minister and he says this is word  number of candidates since 1980 by the time the nominations closed at noon today the pap has fielded eighty-one candidates and the opposition parties thirty-eight seven independents will also be vying for a seat in the new parliament making a total of one hundred and twenty-six this election of the five opposition parties in the red this year the singapore democratic party has nine candidates the workers' party thirteen the national solidarity party eight the singapore malay national organisation or pkms four and the singapore justice party four the total number of opposition candidates this election is forty-five down from seventy-five in 1988 and fifty-one in 1984 this turn of events has given the pap a large number of walkovers forty-one in terms of wards ten out of the fifteen grcs and one out of the twenty-one single seats have been captured by the ruling party even before the hustling have begun in other words almost fifty percent of the registered voters do not have to go to the polls as pre-nomination speculation had predicted the opposition parties have avoided putting up a strong challenge in the grcs with the new requirement for four candidates in each grc one of whom must be a member of a minority group it looks like the opposition has decided they'll have better chances in the single member wards instead twelve ministers were returned unopposed they include senior minister lee kuan yew for the first time he's running with three other candidates in the expanded tanjong pagar grc deputy prime minister ong teng cheong also had a walkover in toa payoh grc we're disappointed i'm sure all our supporters here are disappointed we're all ready for a fight for a contest yes ang mo kio grc has now gone to the people's action party and the hundreds of supporters here are just screaming over with excitement bg lee who picked up one of the highest votes in the last election is positively elated i'm going to try to break through the crowd to get a response from him i'm in a midst of uh disappointment we have hope for contest but election is not over and we're fighting all of the seats the pap supporters have been going absolutely wild for the past few minutes the reason the newly formed kampong glam grc has gone uncontested i ask the minister for defence dr yeo ning hong if he was relieved he didn't have to go up against any opposition this time but a little disappointed the uh supporters are all geared up to uh uh fight a good fight ah there won't be any contest the four constituencies which make up kampong glam has uh in 1988 uh given us better than average uh votes so we are in a sense disappointed that uh we will not be able to uh pull in the extra votes another minister with a walk-over was environment minister dr ahmad mattar who's now returned to brickworks grc well i think we feel happy but at the same time we well especially our our activists feel a little bit disappointed in the sense that uh they were all prepared for a contest the only single-member ward with a walk-over was kreta ayer the seat for finance minister dr richard hu among the new mps the walk-overs were kenneth chen where in 1988 lost to sdp chiam see tong in potong pasir having captured more than half the eighty-one parliamentary seats the pap still faces a fight in the remaining forty seats five grcs and twenty single-member wards five ministers will be facing opposition challenges professor jayakumar lee yock suan mah bow tan seet ai mei and the prime minister himself prime minister goh chok tong arrived at eleven thirty cheered on heartily by his supporters from marine parade grc expectations that the opposition would contest marine parade grc have been fulfilled candidates for the singapore justice party filed in quietly at eleven forty a.m. word supporters dominate outside in the car-park cheering and waving banners and there don't seem to be any supporters for the opposition well there certainly an air of excitement here where a keenly contested fight for bedok grc is expected once again the pap is being led by a strong team by professor jayakumar dr arthur beng mr abdullah tarmugi and mr tan soo khoon who has been moved over from brickworks for the last from the last fifteen years but the opposition is undeterred by this they have once again decide to fight against the pap however with an entire new team can they do better this time i agree that pap has put up a very strong team here and i'm not afraid of that and i'm looking forward to the good fight i've just uh seen the names of the candidates uh i don't see that any of them has been active in bedok or has done anything for the residents in bedok uh we are looking forward to a fight and we are confident that with our team of four my colleagues arthur beng uh tan soo khoon and uh dullah tarmugi we will be able to put up a good fight and get the support from the voters among the mps who will be facing contest in their wards are dr tan cheng bock in ayer rajah who's challenged by mohamed aziz bin ibrahim from pkms in bukit batok dr ong chit chung will face kuan yew keng from the sdp one closely watched constituency will be tanglin which for the first time since 1963 will be contested pap's liew sim pao will face jimmy tan of the sdp and m g guru an independent well i'm excited about it and i think my voters are equally excited because on my walkabouts many of them expressed to me the uh their wish to cast their vote they've not excise their right for a long time and i am glad that this opportunity has risen for them to cast their vote and i hope they will support the pap government one of the most keenly contested areas is expected to be potong pasir where sdp leader mr chiam see tong has been mp since 1984 the mood here is electric sdp's supporters are here and so are the pap who are out in full force to support new candidate mr andy gan but the question is will mr gan be able to reclaim potong pasir for the pap chances are good even though mr chiam has been working there for a long time because uh all pap candidates stand a good chance and furthermore i've worked in the constituency for eight years also and uh people know me and i think they will give me their support these two who have probably got great positions uh for them in the government have been moved away from potong pasir and now they are putting a a candidate which they have not announced in uh to have any positions so you can decide for yourself what what do you think is my competitor this year the opposition is scaling back the size of its challenge to the pap part of the reason is that one party the sdp has decided to use the strategy of treating this year's polls as a by-election they're hoping that by fielding fewer candidates the pap would be able to form the government on nomination day this will make it easier for the opposition to win more seats on august the thirty-first however bg yeo has this to say i don't quite understand the by-election strategy you know i think they are making a virtue of necessity because they have great difficulty getting candidates i mean to have good candidates you must have people who feel that there are strong rallying causes which make it worth their while to jump into the fray they've not been able to get very many good people so they decided to concentrate their effort and therefore to say that it's a by-election strategy in other words it is making a virtue out of necessity this year there seems to be a greater measure of co-operation among the opposition parties their strategy is to pool their candidates together to form grc teams strong enough to challenge the pap in eunos grc the pap faces an opposition team which includes the former member of the sdp mr mohamed jufrie mahmood he joins npmp lee chiew choh wee han kim and maurice yeo from workers' party it is at this constituency where the pap won its closest fight in 1988 this time round they're again fielding senior minister of state for education dr tay eng soon and he's also joined by his colleagues sidek saniff and chew heng cheng and charles chong one must not be too too self-confident in this matter you know uh i think we still have to work hard to win the elections but uh we've been uh talking to various groups of people and uh trying to see whether there are any major issues that and unhappiness they have uh so far they have brought out very few what do you think of chance your chances of becoming a full mp this time around well we've always been optimistic what makes you think that this strategy of moving into workers' party will work i mean uh instead well i cannot tell you for sure that it'll work but i think it gives us the best chance and i being in touch and having close close rapport with the leadership of the sdp and the wp i think i should be able to bring these two parties together the opposition has concentrated its efforts on the single-member wards for example word of the jurong junior college nomination centre are being contested these pap supporters have come out in full force to cheer their side on and it's this kind of support that the pap will have to count on word  for the second time running sdp chairman mr ling how doong will be up against dr seet ai mee dr seet won by a narrow margin in the 1988 election when i met mr ling in 1988 i was not completely not known to singapore and uh very and had very little exposure even in the consitu the new constituency of bukit gombak in the last three years i have worked hard to be a good mp to my residents and have tried to develop facilities which the residents needed and have gained great rapport with them so it is uh it will still be a hard fight uh but it will be a test of the residents' appreciation uh and whether and that their support for me to carry on the kind of work i've done with them in the last three years i expect those who supported me at the last general election in 1988 would support me this time round and then i would expect those who supported dr seet they would turn round and support me because of all those very harsh policies of the government  another closely watched constituency will be ulu pandan where the pap has fielded mr lim boon heng to take over from dr dixie tan mr lim faces sdp's ashleigh seow who in the last election contested aljunied grc of course i would uh have to work hard to uh meet them and uh explain to them uh what i have done in ang mo kio and how i can uh translate the ideas which we've implemented in ang mo kio into ulu pandan what do you think your chances are well it's always an upward battle against the pap they are entrenched they have all the assets at their disposal all the means financial and otherwise so it's always an upward battle for the opposition today the pap introduced two candidates khoo sai kee and harun abdul gani those have walk-overs within the first two hours of being introduced for the pap the total number of first-timers is eleven the party usually fields between sixteen and eighteen new faces but as the prime minister has said because of the early electionit couldn't meet its usual quota this year's new pap candidates eight have already walked in without a fight one of them khoo sai kee who's in the tanjong pagar grc team together with another new face lim hng kiang commented on their walk-over we are we are we are mps and uh we are a little bit disappointed because uh we have no opportunity to uh to work the ground so this means that hng kiang and i are virgin mps uh so which means we've to work even harded to get to know the people new pap candidate for the walk-over is ho peng kee sembawang grc i'm a bit disappointed at not having had the opportunity to go through an election i think that's uh for me as a first candidate a new candidate something that i would learn a lot as for the rest of the new pap candidates it will be the first time they're campaigning for a seat in parliament on the opposition side there are about twelve candidates fielded for the first time among them are ong teng kui and sari hasa from now till august the thirty-first eighty-five candidates from the six parties will go on the campaign trail and they'll be appealing to some eight hundred and fifty thousand voters who'll make their choice known on polling day 
Singapore	with nine days to go before the votes are cast the political parties are losing no time in stating their campaign platforms just this afternoon four political parties held press conferences mr goh chok tong defined the issue for the pap i call this election so i remain the issue in the constituencies to be contested i am con campaigning on the basis that my style of open consultative government is a right one you know my program they are pub it's published in the next lap my principal programs within the next lap are edusave medifund open university assistance program to help the bottom ten percent of those living in hdb flats whether we are in government now or not that's the issue in which we will be contesting now i take on questions from uh the floor you talk about seeking a clear mandate from the people what do you exactly mean by that  well it's a matter of public perception i've been following the papers quite a few people thought that uh a clear mandate means i must do better than the last election some raise some mention figures of sixty-five percent others sixty percent so it's a question of how the public perceive this clear mandate to be for myself i'm looking for an improvement over the last el election's performance how does the pap have to return to power going by what the opposition has said this is how they see that fighting the election as in effect a by-election uh how would the pap pass its response to that particular strategy well whether it's a general election or a by-election how they want to fight it we are fighting on the basis that i'm the issue so you can call it a by-election the fact remains that i am i am still the issue my judgement is being now put to the test i judge it's a good time to call election i judge that my leadership style is right for singapore at this moment i believe in the program which i've announced so that's the issue and it's something which i'm campaigning amongst the electorate to support now i think we should use the word mandate quite carefully because the pap is now in government so we've got a mandate to govern the right term to use is endorsement before the election i was looking for a mandate now i'm looking for an endorsement we're looking for a clear signal one which the voters themselves will look at and say yes unambiguously this has expressed our will when you say you already have a a mandate a majority now you need you want an endorsement and uh you need something better than last election's performance would that be more than sixty-one point uh percent of the votes well in the last election we did sixty-three percent of the valid votes cast so i'll be looking for performance in terms of something better than sixty-three percent but uh you just can't pinpoint the figure because perception is like love and if you have been loved how deep or how deeply loved are you how do you measure it you see so it's a public perception whether sixty-three is considered a strong endorsement and uh number of seats won or lost i think there's a combination of factors the quality of the results but when you see the results you will know whether it is clear or not clear if you are in love you know whether you are in love or not and if you have to measure it you can't be if you have to measure it yah you can't be in love you pretend to be in love if you do not get the endorsement you're looking for or how will that how will that affect your plans specifically your plans for calling by-elections within twelve to eighteen months well uh first let me clarify you know 'cos some reporters thought that my last statement at a dialogue session at moulmein was a bit of a threat when i said that if i receive a weak signal i may have to go a little slow on uh medisave and ed medifund and edusave now i believe in the program so even if i get a weak signal i will still campaign with my colleagues with the public to implement the pro in the uh the program it must be i believe in them uhm there was a bbc interview earlier uh last week which said that if you won by a narrow margin there would be a groundswell within the party for bg lee to take over uh would you like to elaborate on that well i think the foreign press they would always like to play one against another which is why i have bg lee here today to show that uh the swell is with me mr goh i don't mean to be ? ? if the public would be interested worst case scenario if let's say the pap does lose all remaining seats forty seats you say you would consider or should step down if that's the case if that happens do you have a narrow parent who is he and is he ready i have not contemplated such horrors it must be because my judgement is that this is a good time to call for election and i'm seeking you know a strong endorsement for my program so that thought hasn't crossed my mind at all furthermore the pap has not had its steps it's one team and if you will do that it's a rejection of the whole team not of one man could you explain your approach to spending the reserves uh and is it very different from the approach of the old government now the spare reserves means to use up to consume reserves that's not what we are going to do what we have in mind is to use reserves for particular purpose now we are not going to use ten billion of our reserves we start off with one billion for edusave and thereafter the funds must be accumulated from economic growth and future surpluses we didn't want to wait to accumulate the one billion because we thought education is a good thing start off immediately now this is using reserves it's not using up reserves it's not spending reserves it's taking out one billion which is under the control of finance ministry put aside into a dedicated account called education endowment fund or edusave and that account will be managed by the board of trustees concerned with education the revenue from that account will be used for the students not the principals in other words we're trying to rear two golden geese one called the edusave goose the other one uh medifund goose and you don't slaughter your golden goose that's to prevent anybody from cutting their necks some more that's to prevent others cutting off the necks of the geese but the eggs will be distributed that's what we are doing this is just a follow-up question uh if you're not using uh the reserves as it were uh why is it important uh for you to to get a clear mandate from from from the people well uh it's not just just a mandate for a change in the way of using reserves it's a mandate for the whole program and the program is a major program it is a very big uh program a major initiative on my part in aimed primarily at the pocket of population to level up the population over the last few years our program was aimed primarily at the able the talented in society independent schools gifted program for very able children income tax uh deductions for the professionals so i'm trying to level up our society by having this program aimed in at the pocket of population i want to have an endorsement on the way i think on my philosophy on the direction i'm taking and that involves using reserves for the two funds but not using up reserves i will repeat that the next lap is not just about uh edusave or medifund it's also about the arts how do we have a more vibrant cultural environment uh for singaporeans to express themselves george has been thinking quite deeply on this issue so maybe you may want to say a few works on this we want refreshing aspects of mr goh chok tong's leadership is that he gives us more space to exercise our initiative to do the things which we want to do and therefore to make more creative contributions to the larger process one important aspect which we need to overcome is how to increase our charm at all levels it may seem facile it may seem trivial but i would say that the ability of the government or leaders of singapore as a whole to be more charming it's very important it affects our ability to be creative and to create to market and to encourage others to make use of our facilities to encourage others to come to singapore to encourage others to settle here so the arts the creative industries are essential parts of this new singapore that we're talking i mean charm is very important it's not just edusave it's not just medifund it's not just the scs because in this world that we are going into power is more diffuse soft power is as important as hard power and our ability to woo to charm to enthuse is very important and mr goh's leadership in the next lap ushers in such a phase for singapore are you happy with the majority that this party asks for are you concerned that it could be perceived as a majority by people because voters in the walk-over constituencies will never get a chance to exercise their votes no personally i would have preferred more seats to be contested because we have so many new candidates and there's nothing like uh putting a new candidates through the paces but uh that's over so there's no point talking about uh what it should be or should not be we will not take we will not take our voters for granted no we should not we'll work very hard we don't take them for granted we will not take them for granted we'll work very hard to win their votes uh that's correct because if you take your voters for granted then uh they would also tell you that you have taken them for granted in a very painful way right thank you the workers' party on the other hand ask why the elections are being held so soon its main spokesman was j.b. jeyaratnam who's disqualified from contesting this election why are they necessary at this particular point of time is the country facing an economic recession that the government has to bring in drastic measures and so they think we'd better go back to the people and explain to them or is there some na national you know calamity that is staring at us in the face and for which the government wants to be prepared and therefore wants the people to back to give them a mandate we had you know i'm sorry to say just shibboleth from the pap on the need for this elections as far as the party is concerned and particularly my concern is to bring down the pap's share of the vote now come on they're clearly going to be in the government and there's no question of we taking over and i hope that on the first of september we will see that the pap's vote has slumped from sixty to fifty six fifty seven mr jeyaratnam also touched on medisave and edusave those are of course important issues and we will tell the people that these all this medisave edusave are not really designed and meant to help those who are unable to provide for themselves  for the singapore democratic party chiam see tong repeated his call for a strong opposition as the pap has been returned to government he's confident the sdp's strategy of contesting this election as a by-election can work we believe we have succeeded in fact we have completely succeeded we cannot have a better uh pronouncement on nomination day what can we expect forty contested seats that's the maximum we can have it's beautiful it all works to our advantage at this point of time so up to this point of time we are taking the sdp and the opposition are taking the initiative not uh people's action party in the past they've always taken the initiative they've introduced issues and we were all led by the nose and get dragged into arguments with them on the issue which they have chosen in other words we have gone to contest with them on the grounds and in the circumstances uh in which they have chosen of course we get slaughtered we get defeated but now it's it's different it's no harm failing but we learn from our failures from our lessons so we are taking them on now on our terms not their terms and i believe the people of singapore are behind us well that's how the strategy for some of the parties has been shaping up 
Singapore	can i have your first question please kube from wan san news agency my question is to you clement de souza now in your interview with the sbc radio on election morning you are quoted as saying that you wouldn't mind losing one or two single seat constituencies now four opposition candidates have come in is this because the opposition candidates were better qualified than the pap candidates or is it a sign that singaporeans want an opposition in parliament well i have decided that singaporeans have uh taken up mr chiam's argument that you need to have opposition in parliament to check the government it's also a sign that uh the candidates there are comparable to ours and the electorate have returned those candidates who in their view appear to be good mps whether it is indeed so will be seen when these mps take up their duties we are convinced that we have had good candidates and we fielded the best team we could find the electorate felt that the opposition candidates were plausible that they spoke well and they presented themselves well and decided to give them a try well we'll see what they can do  question in chinese  uh i'll try to understand the best i can in english and if i miss out on some points uh either teng cheong or loong can answer you possibly in uh mandarin uh you wanted to know uh what is this work of psychology frankly speaking i find it difficult to understand good economic growth no difficult issues programmes which have benefited the people not just over the last three years but over the last 26 years and that this should be the outcome i also thought that the belief in this open consultative style of government and that they were encouraging me and my programme and yet the percentage has gone down and we've lost uh 4 seats but for those 4 seats which we have lost if we going into details perhaps there are local reasons it is understandable if there's this mood for wanting to have some plausible opposition members of parliament so i can understand why we lost uh hougang bukit gombak of course potong pasir and uh yishun central but uh i cannot understand the results in eunos there is not a case of 4 strong candidates against us we have two ministers of state in eunos dr tay eng soon sidek saniff and two very good mps charles chong and chew eng chee chew eng chee has been working on the ground for many years and it's eunos which worries me not bukit gombak or hougang because if i'm sure if we look into the reasons in detail we can find an explanation but eunos as of now i just cannot understand and i'm fearful 'cos i cannot understand i've challenged uh jufrie openly on the use of religion and race to win votes pkam pkms candidates also invoked religion and they had had a good votes too so i think the signal has been given to many people outside that the use of communal and religious pulls can win you votes that's what i'm more worried about tonight apprehensive about the future that the loss of 3 or 4 seats where there could be an explanation now whether there will be any change of government policy well i think we would have to review what we want to do uh obviously i would not see moving my programmes so decisively so quickly it's not possible i got to try to read the message do they support the programme and i would have to modify the programme if necessary whether the grassroots are still strong in touch with the ground oh ah our grassroots are still strong they're in touch with the ground i move around too uh i could sense this time to see that the mood was good people are friendly they wave to me as i drove uh along i i looked up the flat and they waved to me malay indians chinese all very friendly and yet this is the result so i got to try and understand what they are signaling us two questions sir first looking deeper at the election results do you see some signals from the chinese voters especially the chinese educated looking at the results in hougang in nee shun in yishun do you see some signals that they are not happy with some of the government policies i can't come to a conclusion uh now but uh low thia kiang is a bilingual candidate speaks good english speaks good mandarin communicates effectively and he's a teochew hougang has a lot of teochew i believe that could be a factor because in his in his rally speeches he used teochew to reach out to the population over there tan guan seng is also a bilingual in english and mandarin but he couldn't speak to them in teochew so that's one obvious factor but there could be other factors that i'll have to look into yes how would this effect your calling for a by-election well i've said i would hold by-elections within 12 to 18 months i would still plan a by-elections uh let us have one more and it'll be quite complete uh mr goh eunos factor how much of it could have been due to feeling amongst malay voters that you've came up too hard against him for instance the use of inshallah and so on in the speeches by jufrie you see that's what worries me because if i don't come down hard on a candidate using communal line then they would have gone even much further in this election and because i came down hard that put a stop to it i do not know about this use of inshaallah whether that annoyed the malays or not uh i mean i don't quite understand fully uh the proper occasions to use such phrases maybe it's annoyed quite a few people uh wong kan seng's remarks could have perhaps caused some misunderstanding on on on a the use of such religious phrases but could you imagine when the crowd is excited after listening to a to a to a rally speech and then the use of religious phrases i think that could evoke very strong gut feel in the malays i'm not saying that the use of the phrases is wrong but i'm saying that in the right in the wrong occasion it could lead to more problems so far as we can tell because we brought this out into the open and took a strong stand against jufrie the ground move in our favour the ground meaning both the chinese voters as well as the malay voters if we had not done it i think we would clearly have lost eunos and the consequences would have been even worse for singapore i agree with that observation we would have lost eunos had we had not moved strongly jufrie's line of politicking can i say a few words on this yah when i commented on jufrie's use of uh inshallah and halam durillah one reporter asked me whether it's really wrong i said that when used in the right context when used in the right context it's really the nothing wrong but in a rally when you're appealing to the gut feels the emotional fulls of the malays and using a rousing speeches talking about religion talking about appealing to the communal feelings that's a very dangerous line to take i did clarify that point  question in mandarin   laugh as i've said in the campaign you cannot have your cake and eat it a vote for the opposition is for the opposition is a vote against my style of government because as i told them in this election i was the issue and i was contesting in every seat i wanted to have this clear mandate from the people for my style of government that's very clear we joined issue over there mr chiam campaigned on the basis that they should return more opposition members into parliament i was campaigning on the basis that if you do that you are not giving me support and i did put it to that that you cannot have your cake and eat it you got to choose and they've chosen more opposition mps so i have to review what is it that they are signaling me and more important whether my style will win the pap more votes in future no matter how popular it is to the people there is such a thing called bottom line this style has caused me 4 seats this time will it cause me another 4 seats in future as i've said both during the campaign and earlier on when i made my introductory remarks personally i'll be very reluctant to change this open consultative style it's part of me i believe in it i still want to involve people in government but to say that i would go back and reflect upon this and modify my style i think would be telling you a lie i certainly would    19 mar ' 92 fm 90.5  from the first games held in 1968 in chicago usa the special olympics movement has grown to include over eighty countries today started by eunice kennedy shraiver on the belief that intellectually disabled people can be trained to enjoy and compete in sports the movement provides year round training and athletics competition but the movement relies entirely on volunteers and private organisations so does it face a problem with getting enough of either jane ong has been talking to the chairman of special olympics international sergeant shraiver??  sergeant shraiver  so are you saying that since 1968 when the movement started you've never had any problems with volunteers coaches helpers to help train the these people  sergeant shraiver  what about the participants themselves you have no problem with volunteers but with the participants are the people willing to come forward to take part  sergeant shraiver  what so why do you think that has changed why do more uhm men mentally handicap people come forward now to join in the the movement  sergeant shraiver  do you think the special olympics uh movement has anything to do with this change about changing perception of what an an intellectually disabled person can do and cannot do  sergeant shraiver  well singapore has been sending representatives to the games since 1983 jane ong also talked to the president of special olympics singapore robin chua to find out whether volunteers are as easy to come by as sergeant shraiver said at the moment uhm have problem with getting the right kind of volunteers volunteers that do has a specific knowledge on a certain sports we certainly would like to have volunteer in this area volunteers uh in the other areas like uh administration management uhm we do not have any difficulty getting such volunteers so what we have been uh doing uh at the moment is that uh we have encouraged more people from the school of uh physical education to come forth to help us and we are uhm quite successful in that area what about the response from the intellectually disabled uh children here are they coming forth to take part in the games yes at the moment the bulk of the training uh is given to students who are already in our special schools uhm what we are trying to do uh uhm is to reach out to those who have already gone out to work uhm but there are certain constraints like uh getting uh time-off from uhm employers uh fitting into their training schedule with their their work schedule uh so there are certain constraints in it in that area but we have already lot of few of them who has already gone out for open employment to come back for training and we're able to do that say in on on a saturday afternoons on sundays  so the response has been good you would say yes definitely uhm it it has caught on uhm we are really encourage by this especially uhm those athletes that has gone to many place when they came back we noticed a certain subtle change in them they're becoming uh social competent they are more friendly they make friends very easily they could make friends to passengers on the plane you know you it's really fantastic robin chua on the change in special at at olympics participants well on that encouraging note we end this morning's am singapore tomorrow we'll be having bonnie hicks into the studio to talk about her latest book discuss disgust so don't forget to tune in from producer karen won and the rest of the team i'm pek siok

Singapore	in cuba politics of staying of alive and watching television how it may be the best thing for malay students all these and more in the next twenty minutes hello and welcome to am singapore i'm shanji dabarachaji the latest ceasefire the eighth in the croatian conflict appears to be still holding out and well this may have given the negotiators time for both sides to broker for a more lasting peace that time may be running out although the yugoslav armed forces have agreed to lift their blockade of seven ports in return for an end to a croatian siege they haven't however agreed to withdraw from croatia also at six o'clock this morning there were reports of mortar clashes in the eastern croatian towns of word and  word  given such ceasefire violations peck siok lian asks steven  word whether the people who put their names to the agreement actually had any control over the forces on the ground  sp  well the ceasefire agreement seems to have avoided a major issue by not making any mention of the croatian demand for a total withdrawal of federal troops from the republic does this mean that there will be uh negotiations leading to a re-drawing of the internal boundaries of yugoslavia  sp  but uh by not going along with the croatians don't you feel that uh the serbians are in fact adamant on making uh herself the dominant republic in yugoslavia and therefore uhm working towards what has been called the greater serbian nation  sp  and that was steven pavlovich from the university of southampton socialism or death well that rather ominous question was fidel castro's defence of communism but when a country hold its fourth party congress later today the question is one of survival the survival of a dying breed of orthodox socialism and the survival of a castro regime when the two thousand or so delegates meet today their main task is to draw up a blueprint for the island socialist system rather than dish out magical remedies for the crumbling cuban economy  word is chief of a hispanic division at the us library of congress in washington d.c. producer tan yong meng asked him how the recent announcement of possible cut in soviet aid to cuba could affect its economy as well as the congress proceedings  cb  so in the light of this how closely do you think the cubans will be watching for changes in the party congress that's starting later today  cb  do you expect fidel castro to institute any kind of reforms if uh to just satisfy these uh expectations  cb  but is there a serious challenge at this moment to his leadership do you think  cb  so given the rather severe economic conditions at the moment how long do you think that fidel castro can hold off public discontent  cb  col blazier on the future of fidel castro's socialist cuba in a moment spending too much time in front of the television we find out why malay parents may approve in november last year teleview launched the first supplementary material and revision tutorials better known as smart and the aim to provide comprehensive syllabus of revision materials for primary school students the first smart lessons were in english mathematics and science then about six weeks ago the chinese smart lessons were launched yesterday the malay smart program was introduced this has paved the way for the implementation of smart lessons using teleview's new interactive learning system or i uh or ils the malay smart will be the first to use the system mrs goh kwan kwan teleview's resident product manager explains to  word just how interactive the system can be in teaching languages these systems allowed some the computer to mark the answers keyed in by the students and it will keep the scores that means immediately after you finish the lesson it will tell you whether the answer is correct or wrong if it is correct they'll be given one mark for the questions and at the word at the end of the lesson they will give you a total score and give you the ranking are you say that the students can be ranked using this system how are they ranked with whom with all those who have locked in the teleview who have tried the particular lessons all those people who sign in the system know who you are okay so they will know uh this is your first attempt of this the questions or this is the second attempt of this of the of the set of questions so let's say you score ten out of twenty very likely your score will be in the fifteenth fiftieth position it'll provide some uh motivation for some of the students maybe not all that want to be always on the top and uh at the same time it provide convenience that means you can stop anytime at their own pace so let's say if you uh this lesson have ten questions okay you have finished until six question and you have to you know have to stop for some reason and the next time you come back it he knows that you stop at the tenth lesson and he will give you the eleventh lessons for you to continue to complete the lessons can the system tell him where he's gone wrong so far the malay lessons that we have uh uh prepared uh didn't show that because uh the teacher think that it's not necessary at this point in time because it's a little bit simple maybe for the future lessons we will uhm have another uh page to show them uh if you're wrong why you are wrong and what is the corrections uh in a classroom situation when the student finds it very difficult to learn a language in what ways can this interactive system encourage him to learn a language the teachers that uh write this particular lesson uh they are experts in this area okay and they know they know how to use interactive uh colourful graphics uh sometime even crossword puzzle to attract them uh we also give bonus to the student who complete the lessons now in language learning pronunciation is very important how does the system help a student pronounce the words properly we have another package on teleview that has voice respond voice output in fact it is the digitized word human voice all the teleview user can download this program and get a voice card and they can have a voice output and it will be very effective for learning uh language spoken language mrs goh kwan kwan teleview's resident product manager and from acquiring a language to learning love acceptance and responsibility find out how pre-schoolers here are gaining these values next on am singapore  tc  that was tan chuen a four year boy with cerebral pulsy singing a song he had just learned in school tan chuen is one of the six disabled children who have been integrated into regular preschools with the help of assisted integration supporter or word  the two year uh the two year pilot project is set up by the singapore counselor of social services it hopes to study the feasibility of integrating physically disabled children between the ages of two and five into existing pre-schools at present word is providing consultative and therapeutic support word preschools it hopes to however to involve more centres and to have a total of forty disabled students in regular pre-schools by the end of two years karen won ask judy hills the project director whether such a setting was the most conducive environment for a disabled child  jh  but in a regular pre-school teachers are not trained in working with the special needs children so uhm will this actually hamper the handicapped child's learning process  jh  will the lessons uh have to be adapted with the presence of uh handicapped child in the school  jh  but the teachers will have to pay more attention to this uh special needs child so will the other children uh actually get less of a teaching time  jh  can you be sure that when the child moves out of this preschool there will be actually uh kindergarten or even a primary school who might be willing to take the child on  jh   word is a teacher in one of the pre-schools under word  according to her bringing the two groups of children together has had a positive effect on the behaviour of the pre-schoolers ah the rest of the kids at first they are very uhm they more they tend to fight more and with wan yi around they tend to help and i see their other side of them you know the good side all that instead of just the naughty side they are very nice they play with wan yi very well and i saw that they are they can talk to her and they play with her very well and they help her whenever like if she fell down they help to pick her up and if let's say she cannot colour very well they try to tell wan yi that you're supposed to colour this way you're supposed to paint this way they help her they become very helpful and they're very responsible kids now he's more vocal he's able to relate stories to me what he has done and uh he's uh more independent in terms of social behaviour he does things on his own uhm prior to that when he was uh at the uh uh special school he was not that responsive responsive i've to do things for him i guess the children there they don't talk very much and uh uhm so right now when he's uh in this school he plays with the kids the kids they talk to him and he picks up words from them uhm and i guess the uh the kids benefit too in terms uh you know when they interact with handicapped child with the children like tan zhen they are more caring helpful and uh i guess the it it remove the stigma that people have uh you know uh uh towards handicapped to towards the handicapped and that was mrs shuen tan talking about the benefit of integration for her physically disabled son that report was compiled by karen won and on that young note we have to the end of today's edition of am singapore join me shanji dabarachargi with with producer peck siok lian and tan yong meng tomorrow for more of the stories behind the news till then have a nice day    28 june 1992  and sport tonight starts with results the national bowling championship and congratulations are in order as grace has taken the title in the women's section i believe it's the first time you've won the title since taking up the sport eight years ago yes indeed and i'm absolutely thrilled i've often been teased by my fellow bowlers to be only interested in uh major the tournaments abroad should the troupe be told that i actually faced a lot of home ground pressure uhm bowling in singapore and i guess the big pool of talent out there uh adds on more pressure and it also probably stemmed from the fact that i won my first tournament in nineteen eighty four six months into the sport uhm was there any particular reason why you were doing so much better in the international titles than in the national games i guess uhm psychologically i was better prepared and being a local tournament uhm i i have not prepared myself well enough over the years and having four years of experience behind me and international exposure there's no reason for me not to do well any more locally but uh uhm what are your plans now well i'm looking forward to the asian fiq which which would be held in august in in perth and also the major uhm big event south east asian games next year and singapore will be hosting the sea games next year and i'll be going for my third masters title so hopefully i will be prepared then 'cos i have a whole year to do that  good luck thank you 
Singapore	on am singapore this morning what australia looks for in president bush's visit singapore australia tie up with an arts and food business during the holidays hello i'm zainal abidin president george bush arrives in australia today the first stop of his twelve day trip to the asia pacific countries which includes singapore south korea and finally japan  word was the mission he meant to be a good move visit is now said to be more of a trade mission with creations of jobs for americans at home as his primary target to the countries he's visiting he carries the firm message that free trade is a two way street by this he hopes to gain greater access for us goods and services into booming asia pacific economists the message is primarily aimed at the japanese with whom us has a trade deficit of forty billion us dollars and seventy five percent of which is attributed to the high export of japanese cars into the united states without reciprocal openness by the japanese automobile market but during his talk in australia the top issue on the agenda is likely to be america's defence commitment in the region but is this the only concern of the australians with some insight into the australian's view of the matter i'm joined on the line now by political correspondent in australia mike  word  good morning mike yes uhm so will regional defence or regional security be australia's key concern uh during bush's visit there no what are the specific trade issues that will be raised by australia so what do australians generally feel about bush's call for a free trade and greater access for us goods in the asia pacific market now something has has it that us agricultural surplus with australia goods into a very high figure of about about one billion dollars actually but will be australia's request on on this matter to the us for this now you know since the whole matter concerns the farmers do you expect the farmers to go on a demonstration to show their displeasure of uh us agricultural subsidies policy uhm uh now with a with reference to the defence uh commitment of the us in the region what do you think uh would be australia's uh particular expectations of bush's trip well thank you mike for joining us this morning political correspondent mike word of melbourne  word on the line from canberra a corporation of the artistic kind between singapore and nanyang ac academy of fine arts with an australian university will give art enthusiasts the opportunity to get their fine arts degree locally in the past getting a degree in the fine arts often meant studying in a foreign country this prospect will now change students can now pursue a degree course at the nanyang academy of fine arts under a joint campus arrangement with curtin university in australia starting july nineteen ninety two the academy will be adding another year to its normal three-year diploma course students taking this additional year will be eligible for a degree awarded by curtin university but what's the advantage of having a paper qualification in a field such as the fine arts where it's the work that counts a question shanji dabaracharji put the academy's president dr gwee ee hian the work of course comes in most importantly in fact it's also based on the work that they will be awarded degrees also when an employer employs an artist he will look at the work rather than at the paper you have so you are quite right in that regard but on the other hand uh there is a tendency in singapore as elsewhere for people who have completed tertiary education to receive that degree as a sort of a benchmark of their uh educational uh uh progress you know so i think there's no reason why people in art and in design you see should be deprived of that opportunity and be on par with others who study the traditional disciplines i think the satisfaction to the people who are in this area is also very important so it's basically a self-satisfaction in getting a degree uhm that's the main purpose of going for this uhm this course offered by curtin i think it's more than that it's also recognition that your work you see has also reached a standard which is on par with other university studies well you talk about standards uh i understand that curtin university will be determining the academic syllabus for this course but how will the local asian flavour be retained in this course because you seeing how curtin is an australian university oh the uh development of the curriculum for this fourth year will be done in fact jointly the uh students will be taught by us and therefore the asian flavour would still be retained and for the theoretical studies i think a little bit of uh australia input you see in fact would be very very useful but the bulk of the teaching being done in singapore by our own staff and the environment is such we are pretty sure you see that the fourth year as far as the style as the content go you see will be a continuation of the first three years where the students were trained by us so there will be some retention of the local asian flavour even if they even if the degree is conferred by curtin university uh i think it will be more than retention the local flavour will be there in fact that's one aspect where curtin is very interested they also want to see that uh our work here would also have some influence on their home students in australia later on it's a two-way exchange it's a two way exchange so what exactly will our students be learning from curtin university if it is uh will it be basically style technique uh style technique yes but i think they would also inject a stronger element of theoretical studies than what uh we have been accustomed to could you get elaborated than that i think uh the training in nafa had been studio-based so uh the australians would probably come in and provide uh academic studies like psychology of art history of art aesthetics and so on and also they will bring in some australian influence and background which will interact with our nanyang influence to create something that is even more interesting than you know what we have been doing on our own dr gwee ee hian uh principal of the nanyang academy of fine arts you've just tuned in you're listening to am singapore and coming up next how the food business is faring during this festive season fancy dining on the top of the world feasting on juicy lobsters delicate ascagoes and popping champagne to welcome in the nineteen ninety two at midnight tonight well sounds infinitely tempting doesn't it well if you're willing to splurge a whopping a hundred and eighty eight dollars on fine wine and exquisite cuisines then treat yourself but for most other singaporeans the traditional new year's eve dinner tonight may be a less elaborate affair but an affair nonetheless singaporeans may not have shopped as much this christmas on new year's season because of expected economic slowdown as recent reports suggest but the feasting and partying seems as feverish as ever in fact when tan yong meng made a check with three major local hotels all reported an increase in sales volume in their food and beverage outlets word executive assistant food and beverage manager of hyatt word  eric golding manager of goodwood park said the hotel also registered an increase in business this christmas daniel chia director of operation at smi hospitality services which manages the pinacle attributes the better sales this year to more sensitive pricing strategies well compared to last year surprisingly there has been an improvement of about five percent uh i said surprisingly because uh when i took a walk around around the uhm shopping centres there appeared to be uh a lack of uh activity compared to past years festive season it is our new pricing strategy that has uh enabled us uh to reach out uh much more patrons since october we have a pricing package which allows the patrons to choose three four or five courses uh on a run of the menu basis at uh a minimum of sixty two dollars plus plus i believe that this is the uh main factor which uh motivated people to come to the pinacle  word of hyatt one of the hotels' main strategies in filling restaurant seats is direct selling to an identified segment of the market one food chain that did experience a slowdown in business this festive season is the tung loke group of restaurants its managing director andrew chew it is satisfactory in general but uh we do experience a drop in sales in uh some of our restaurants but this ah could be due to uh more rainy days this month than uncertainty about the future of the economy andrew chew expects harder times ahead especially when singaporeans tightens their belt in economic slowdown to make things worse he expects keener competition from new restaurants expect to to open next year eating is a national hobby but most singaporeans eat out less especially when one needs to dig deep into one's pocket in leaner times the three hotels that tan yong meng talked to weren't too concerned about the prospects of a slowdown so the heartier your word appetite is next year the more mouth mouth-watering the takings will be for hotels and restaurants in the meantime if you're planning on dining out at some pricy joints tonight it's fine wine glorious food and wise company to usher in the new year bonapetit and a very happy and profitable new year and on that festive note we end this morning's edition of am singapore we'll be back again tomorrow morning to bring you more stories behind the headlines on new year's day until tomorrow then on behalf of producer tan yong meng this is zainal abidin wishing you a relaxing holiday   moneymind 28 june ' 93  christopher good evening good evening david welcome to moneymind well we've seen the market already take a fall and comeback intraday we've seen it stop at seventeen twenty-one is this the correction and do you still think that we could test seventeen hundred uhm it is part of the correction but i still think we can test seventeen hundred uh though of course uhm since realism has been built into the market uhm a lot of the bad news if you like is now being discounted in the market you see you must understand david that much of what has been attributed to us uhm i think hasn't been probably over exaggerated the main argument that we have been putting is that the market moves on perception and many people had been concerned about overheating in china so hong kong has they've been taking money out of uh they have seen the malaysian second and third liners go through the roof so they're weary there and well basically most word investors have been losing money in thailand so they know there've been a problem in the bangkok market but they see singapore as being terribly safe and and i think that's the principle concern okay when you made this prediction you looked at certain indicators would you like to take us through some of this yes i'll like to take you two very si simple ones the first one is our leading indicator for the economy as you can see there on the yellow line uhm the economic indicator is suggesting as least one if not two quarters of week gdp growth now i'm not saying that there's going to be a fall out but the point is that many international and local investors had assumed no uh uhm hiccups in gdp growth and consequently you know this small problem the second is the timing problem  we are expecting the market to improve very dramatically but as shown in this second chart which has earnings versus the market now the yellow line is the market changes and the red line is the earnings change as you can see there is actually a very strong correlation between the two theory suggests that the market does anticipate changes in earnings as we can see in 1981 and 82 now in 1983 and 84 the market over-anticipated and was pulled down if we go to 1992 and look at that the market is anticipating a rise 
Singapore	this is am singapore with the stories behind this news singapore gets a precinct of five museums and france of his masters in business and engineering good morning i'm peck siok lian a national heritage board will be set up next year to manage a precinct of five museums stretching from the old saint joseph institute to fort canning the five centres include the singapore history museum and a fine art museum to be set up at the old sji and an ancient civilizi civilization museum people's and children museum to be housed in the former tao nan school expected to take twenty years to develop the plans for the museum precinct was announced yesterday by the minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo opening an ex exhibition on gems of chinese art at empress place the minister spoke on the government's attitude towards museums we have not actively promoted the national museum in the past because museums were not high on our scale of national priorities we were more concerned with more basic issues more basic requirements in the past for many years the museum lacks space and expertise and because we did not seem to welcome donations enthusiastically a few singapore collectors chose to give to other countries instead this was a great loss to singapore and i hope this will now change we are now embarked on a program to create more display space and to systematically build up our museum expertise and in the next lap of our national development we must give much more attention to culture and the arts while calling on individuals and corporations to make donations the minister also challenged museum managers to persuade these private collectors and organisations to come forward the modest annual budget the national museum has for acquisitions is hardly enough we'll therefore have to rely heavily on loans and on donations loans can be by private individuals like the word  exhibition which we're opening today all by foreign governments like the tang dynasty exhibition which is now going on at empress place we must also encourage more individuals and corporations to make donations we have received valuable donations in the past but we need much more we need to encourage both singaporeans and non-singaporeans the minister envisioned the museum precinct to be a lively part of the civic district he outlined the challenges ahead in achieving this in addition to good curators we need good entrepreneurs who understand what will draw in the crowds we need a whole area of facilities for the young and old for local residents and for visitors for the serious and the not-so-serious we need good restaurants we need good museum shops and in this way we will be better able to recover a part of our operating costs and to make the whole atmosphere a more lively one the minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo with the challenges spelt out for them what action are our local museum managers likely to take shirley loo-lim is deputy director of the national museum she told shanji dabaracharji that although it's possible to recover part of the museum's operating costs they'll never be self-sufficient the revenue generated will never never be sufficient to support uh all these museums uh earlier on we were saying that all museums in the world are dependent on their respective governments for funding for support there isn't a museum in the world that is totally self-sufficient perhaps there is one in switzerland i believe and that is the transport museum uh but then that museum is totally supported by a very very wealthy individual whose passion is to uh have a a communications museum so that's a separate issue alright but other national museums around the world are very dependent on the state for funding support so you don't anticipate our museums national museum and the empress place museum to become commercially viable independent of government support it will continue to be dependent for government support because i would say about seventy percent of the expenditure would go towards collections' care we have to conserve and preserve the collections we have to maintain we have to have the right environmental standards and controls so these are expensive now the minister has also set down the challenge to the museums in terms of its expertise he's mentioned that the curatorial expertise should be improved and that we should have some entrepreneurial skills also you see coming into the museums correct correct yes how do you entrepreneurial in the sense of uh uh going into some business activities for example uh we plan to start museum shops museum gift shops if you were to visit other museums in europe and in the united states invariably there is the museum gift shop you know and the purpose of this museum gift shop is to retail heritage-based products in other words out of the collections that the museum has we will manufacture things based on our collections for sale not only on the retail basis but also on the wholesale basis we hope we hope well at the moment national museum does not follow up on this trend uh when do you see this actually coming about well we are in fact renovating a corner shop at at armenian street can i leave some surprises up my sleeves because if i tell you everything that we are going to manufacture it might affect our competitive edge you know another another challenge thrown open by the minister was in the sourcing of donations from individuals and corporations how do hope to go about uh achieving this we hope to set up an endowment fund uh when we say donations by corporations and by individuals we don't confine just to to cash donations we are thinking in terms of uh private collectors who have their own private collections of treasures whether they are ceramics bronzes paintings whether chinese paintings contemporary art uh artifacts that private collectors themselves treasure and they may want to share their own collections with other singaporeans and our foreign visitors by lending or donating to the national museum for display this is obviously going to be a challenge for for yourself and the empress place museum uh managers because private collectors are reluctant to still to share their pieces with the public i own out you'll have to leave that to us to our discretion alright something that it's best uh not to talk about in public shirley loo-lim deputy director of the national museum holding her cards word her chest there the time now is seven twenty two next looking abroad to the latest in the middle east it's been threatened used as a bargaining chip and nearly caused the end of a long and sweet friendship but the issue of the american loan guarantees to israel appears to have been finally settled as both countries reached a compromise yesterday in return for the us two billion loan to resettle jewish immigrants in the occupied territories israel will word the construction of new settlements but this is only until those already under construction are completed so how significant a compromise is this on the part of israel earlier this morning dr word from the televiv university in israel gave me his assessment well given this reality will the palestinians talk peace with israel in the next round of talks then if israel will continue building in the occupied territories anyway but how will this compromise affect both shamir and sharon in the next elections given that sharon his hardline housing minister vows never to stop israeli settlements dr word from the televiv university if you have a bachelor's degree and looking to get a masters one country you might want to go to is france local graduates with a basic degree can enter the second year of french word word or prestigious universities and get their masters in two years this is just one of the many educational packages offered by representatives of french universities and graduate schools they're here for a three-day seminar that's jointly organised by the french embassy and the ministry of education although a wide spectrum of different disciplines was introduced emphasis was given however given to engineering and business management studies karen won met up with the director of research word he told her that france is no longer a place where one only goes to study arts and design when a student go over to france to do a degree perhaps in business or even in engineering how marketable are their degrees right could you describe in a very practical uhm way what the differences between the french education in terms of like you mentioned engineering and the american university a common concern most locals have about studying in france is the need to master the language  word director of the centre for applied languages doesn't think it'll be an obstacle ya when you talk about perhaps uhm courses like uh designs or art language may not play such an important part but now you're promoting business and engineering courses uhm in such courses language may play a very important part so will foreign students without a strong mastery in the french language be at a disadvantage are there any preparatory courses or some supports um given to foreign students who may not know the french language very well  word on the learning of french if you want to know more about studying in france you can visit the seminar at the relc or call the french embassy the number is 4664866 that's all for am singapore this week tune in again next monday for more stories behind the news producer shanji dabaracharji this is peck siok lian wishing you have a good weekend    12 mar ' 92 fm 90.5  we have got a good salary package for

pocket and still works after a four foot drop its weight less than a paper-back novel the company thinks its new micro-tech tool will make it the lead in the market  perhaps its number one position is because of the time and money spent on r and d and knowing what the customer wants david keller is the vice-president and operations manager of the asia-pacific cellular subscriber division at motorola david keller jo: but your handphones do not come cheap this new micro-tech tool costs about five thousand dollars obviously you don't think the price is a factor in customers' consideration for cellular handphones psl: the cellular telecommunications market is a fast growing one in the asia-pacific and with so much development in this area how would manufacturers keep up? david keller gauges the trend in the market jo: what would be your projection for the cellular telecommunications market here perhaps compared with the other countries in the region? i understand that thailand is really fast catching too jo: what is your growth projection for this uh market here? david keller talking to jane ong about the potential of the cellular telecommunications market well that's all for

Singapore	on am singapore this morning how will the hisbollah retaliate israel's assassination of its leader but why did israel do it in the first place and asia's upcoming tiger vietnam assures its commitment to foreign investors good morning i'm eleanor nair iran has strongly condemned israel for killing the leader of the pro-iranian hisbollah movement sheikh masawi in lebanon the sheikh his wife their young son and bodyguards died when israeli helicopters attacked the convoy of vehicles in which they were travelling as tens of thousands attended the funeral of sheikh masawi the foreign ministry in tehran has called the killing a terrorist act and has also accused the united states of supporting israel's action most of southern lebanon was reported to be tense and hisbollah has vowed to take revenge but what are they likely to do earlier this morning pek siok lian spoke to james o'connor an expert on terrorism from bradford university part of the reason for the israeli attacks has been the feeling of frustration in israel about the lack of progress on the issue of the missing airman ran ahrad is it fair to say now that his fate is now sealed  jc  but is it only israel which is likely to be responsible for the death of sheikh habas or will the us also be blamed because of their continued support for israel  jc  so you don't think that american installations could also be targets for possible retaliation  jc  but to what extent is the hisbollah free to retaliate on its own as opposed to getting its go-ahead and direction from tehran  jc  but iran has clearly been trying to improve its international standing over the past couple of years so do you think that president rafsanjani do you think he'll be now in a dilemma in that he has to show support for hisbollah and yet not do so at the expense of angering the west too much  jc  but do you think that iran will only give the impression of supporting their muslim constituencies since it was not much appreciated by the west during the gulf war as well as when they stuck out their necks in working for the release of western hostages  jc  so how will israel respond in the likelihood of an hisbollah attack but first how did this whole vendetta start but why did the israelis do what they did at the expense of the peace talks and what fate will that ultimately spell for the middle east peace process daud kutap a journalist from the middle east international talked to peck siok lian from jerusalem but apart from the pride of the military being hurt do you think that the attack was a deliberate israeli attempt to scuff the peace process  dk  so you think the peace process can survive despite this obvious upset  dk  the israelis have warned that the army is also to strike back harshly should hisbollah retaliate now how how fast and where are they likely to first strike back  dk  and that was daud kutap of the middel east international you've been listening to am singapore it's now twenty five minutes past seven vietnam's efforts to move foreign capital and technology into the country has paid off handsomely so far since nineteen eighty eight there's been a three-fold increase in the volume of foreign investments by the end of last year more than three hundred projects were in excess of us two point five billion dollars have poured in now one of the factors that's led to this inflow is its liberal foreign investment flaw which was amended in nineteen ninety it allows for private companies to establish bus business ventures with foreign investors of the thirty four countries putting their investment dollar there taiwan hong kong australia and france are the main contributors and more asian and western countries are rushing in to get a piece of the action despite a us economic embargo so in view of its western-styled economic reforms how important is it for vietnam to normalise ties with the us now  word zainal abidin spoke to madam ngoh ba tan vietnam's parliamentarian and chairwoman of its local mission at a business conference yesterday she's here to promote investments from singapore now surely uhm we understand that the americans' trade embargo is tied also to the uh the fact that uh excess of funds from international financial organisations are not able to reach vietnam and these is important for vietnam because of its lacking of capital so ah is the vietnamese uh side doing anything to to ensure relations get normalised soon  nbt  so in other words you're saying that you're putting aside the uh matter of uh normalising relations with vietnam and looking forward to extending relations with other nations perhaps with uh asean you know how important is asean to uh vietnam's effort to stimulate its economy right now nbt  so when do you think you'll be ready to join asean  nbt  but what about the capitalistic system that is operating in the asean economies i mean uh which is still very new uh or vietnam is still learning about this system so how long will it take for vietnam to to get into this uh market economy or capitalistic economy so to speak well the economic process in vietnam has been going on since nineteen eighty six when it first introduced its own concept of economic renovation or better known as doi moi and to further liberalise its economy the vietnamese national assembly will next month pass a new constitution to protect foreign interest from political interference this will guarantee any legal assets and properties belonging to foreign investors from being nationalised but will the new constitution be binding madam ngoh ba tan  nbt  and that was ngoh ba tan chairwoman of vietnam's local mission speaking to zainal abidin on its commitment to foreign investors and that's all on our program this morning am singapore will be back again same time tomorrow with more stories behind the news from producer peck siok lian and i eleanor nair goodbye    12 mar 1992 fm 90.5  the british general election will be held on april the ninth this has been much expected after chancellor norman lermon presented what he called a budget for recovery for recession hit britian this will be one of the closest election campaigns in britian since world war two britian's economy is at an all time low since the recession in the nineteen thirties so who will win will depend on who can best fix the economy the conservative party led by mr major is also under pressure to win a historic fourth term in office but it seems to be going into the campaign trailing labour the latest opinion poll shows the labour party stealing a three point lead with forty-two per cent of the vote against thirty-nine per cent for the conservatives to find out more about the british election karen won was on the line with alan beatty of the london school of economics earlier this morning now over the recent months mr major has brought the conservative party very much to the centre away from the extreme right wing will this accommodative style actually work to his advantage or disadvantage you think  ab  if indeed economic issues would take centre stage in this election is the labour party able to come up with an attractive counter budget tailored for the ballot box as the conservative party has done  ab  but what about the personalities of the candidate do you think that uhm that would become an issue for example will mr major be able to move out from under the shadow of margaret thatcher to win a sizeable amount of votes  ab  now uh looking at the polls recently it does seems that uhm this is going to be a very close and exciting fight between the two parties now do you think that a coalition government will become a possibility  ab  so what role do you think uhm the liberal democratic party will play in the process  ab  and that was alan beatty of the london school of economics and the time now is twenty-three past seven we turn to home next for a visit to the careers exhibition home of opportunities that's hall three at the uh at the world trade centre where the career ninety-two exhibition open yesterday there students and young adults can shop for a job at any booth set up by the many industries which will offer information on what it takes to make it in most if not all careers for companies too it's a golden opportunity to recruit some urgently needed staff from the show's heavy turn out and some of them even handled out on the spot job applications but for some sectors getting the right staff means giving or doing a lot more than just participating in career exhibitions as zainal abidin finds out i'm now at the career ' 92 exhibition here at the world trade centre there's quite a good spread of industries that are represented here everyone equipped with their best possible paraphernalia and the promotional gadgetry trying to compete or capture the mostly young hearts in mind that have come in large numbers to see what's in store for them in the times to come but the question that comes to my mind is how do the essential services such as the police force the health care and the teaching profession compete with other private companies which tend to be considered more glamourous for the best minds and bodies to come into the profession well first uh i spoke to mrs tan siew kuan whose the spokesperson for the police force uh you'll notice that we we have a very large crowd today here and uh year by year we have in fact been if i may say the most popular booth uh one of the reasons is because basically the inherent nature of the job of the police is in itself very interesting very challenging very varied so because of these people are attracted by the the job the job itself secondly our salaries are very competitive in terms of its uh entry points in terms of uh its uhm i would say salary scales yah we are very very competitive but it's to my knowledge that the police force is also facing a shortage of staff or difficulty in recruiting the right staff into the force now how does it attract uhm or how does it compete for the uh brains to come into the police force instead of going to other companies like the singapore airlines or the the tdb or any other large corporations uh i would i would say that in terms of the people who wanted to join the police we have no difficulty getting the numbers uh neither do we have difficulty getting the right type of people in fact uh last year we had uh for junior officers we have four thousand six hundred and fifty-six applications for senior officers we have about hundred and forty-six applications uh it is not that we are shortage of we have uh we are shortage of staff it's more of the fact that our uh our resig uh our retirement rate is very high alright over the next few years in fact this year we will have four hundred jos who will be retiring when they reach their retirement age limit so we need to recruit very large numbers to replace these retired officers so do you think you'll be able to do that through this uh exhibition and other promotional uh efforts yes uh basically the number of people who actually are attracted to join the police are people who come to the career exhibition year by year and also through our press advertisements the respondents to our press advertisements basically these two avenues are the are the places where large numbers will apply but when they join do they stay long yes they would alright they would stay for long because we have a proper career development system for them yah  joining me now is major wong wai leong head of uh recruitment i believe in the singapore arm forces em what do you think or what do you think you would need to do to bet word to get the best mind into the arm forces considering the fact there's very tight labour market and great competition from private corporations em around here in singapore? wwl: we're aware that the labour market is very tight and very competitive and that's the reason why the saf has actually restructed the uh non-commission uh officer core uh we have now two uh new core one is the specialist core and the other is the warrants officers' core alright uh with this two new core we aim to attract you know uh better uh educated personnel to join the saf and at the same time this people will be groom for uh higher appointments and at the and also to ensure that they are promoted you know fast enough so as to ensure that they would stay on in the arm forces in tangible terms what do you think are the real benefits or incentives that uh the new recruits can look to when they join the arm forces? wwl: i think in terms of salary the saf actually offers a very good uh terms in the sense that uh our salary is as good is uh at least twenty per cent more than the uh civil service right and uh we also continual continually uh study the market condition and review our term and terms and conditions as and when necessary that was major wong wai leong talking to me earlier on at this very impressive uh saf uh counter or booth 
Singapore	mr speaker sir mr speaker sir allow me to express my appreciation for this opportunity to participate in this debate sir i have uh noticed of late nearly all the ministers if not some of the members of parliament have been lamenting that there is a trend in singapore for the people to make use of the reserves now i do not know where they get this feedback other than the fact that polls have been carried out and seems to give the impression that some singaporeans are going for more use of the reserve i think the question here is what sort of question or rather questionnaires were in fact put to the voters or to the uh resident of singapore regarding the use of reserves now if the question is simple one to say would you want to make use of the reserve to improve your living i'm afraid the answer would be a yes simply yes but i think it is important here to draw a distinction between you know budgetary surpluses and all the surpluses accumulate by the statutory bodies over the years and the question should be rightly asked: do you think the government should put all the surpluses in reserves and not just would you want to make use of reserve to improve your standard of living i think if the question had been put differently you would get a different set of answer now there are from the poll it is quite that majority of singaporean believe that singapore should have more reserves that government should put aside as reserve for rainy days i suppose the question here is it is not whether the reserve should be spent i think the question here is what is the limit that the government should put aside our surpluses as reserves now what is the limit now if that is the limit is not defined there'll be no end to the whole thing every time you clamor for more subsidies you are being accused of utilising the reserves but where where where do you stand do do we say we keep on accumulate massive reserves at the same time neglected certain area where we need to have more subsidies example will be like education housing and health now why is the government grudged that more subsidies be given in the field of education for the simple reason is now with more and more schools being converted to independent schools you are confining to only twenty five percent of them having would be able to get scholarships now what about the other seventy five percent of the students are we assuming that all students that can manage to the independent schools are from well-off family i i i thought statistics have already been given that most of them are from housing board estates that would be a clear indication that they are either from the middle or lower income group and also it has been established or it is accepted fact that the only resource we have in singapore is the human resource now why is the government not considering subsidising more for education we are so bogged down with the fear of our national reserve being used we have in fact lost the true meaning of what is the question of uh reserve being utilised and what is the question of uh you know more subsidies in certain field which is consider as investment the government should when come to question of subsidies or reserves consider how much we should accumulate as reserves not just you know keep on accumulating massive surpluses like rov we have uh more than uh one point seven billion and the hdb six hundred over billion million dollars and all the rest now with with a new introduction of uh levies of three thousand uh foreign workers and sixty nine thousand of the maids the government is going to collect over a billion dollars every year for levies alone now why are we you know every time when there is a clamor for subsidies for an essential investment we are grudging to say that we are eating into our reserves even if it it so, so be it it must be when we come to the field of education more people should be subsidised we are not not all the singaporeans who send their children to school are like all of us here who can afford it not forgetting sir if i may repeat again here we have seven hundred fifty thousand people earning only eight hundred dollars a month and then we have four hundred fifty thousand people earning only one thousand dollars a month now do you blame these people asking for more money to subsidise their children in school it is out of necessity rather than with the intention to squander away the government reserves we must do more for these people when these class of people clamor for subsidies they should have our support because it is a genuine case for want of support it is not a case of squandering away our reserves for consumption purposes which of course i would even object i am not one for welfarism but i am one that our people should be subsidised in the field of education in the field of housing i'm quite sure the government has got all the feedback these are the two fields that the government ought to look into the last election is a clear indication singaporeans felt that with the increasing fees and costs in education and health have burdened them unnecessarily to the extent that it may be you know financially unable to cope with the situation and uh i can give an exact example like it is like a millionaire making a will a millionaire making a will to the children but in the will it's said that the children can only make use of the money when they reach the age of twenty one but in the meantime they could hardly subsist they could not even live now but the will said no you can't make use of the money until you reach an age of twenty one now why can't we use more of this money for the benefit of the people in the field of education sir the next point sir i would move to word  the question of the hdb upgrading sir sir, the problem with you people is this you know you don't take you can't criticism from us when i brought up the matter i merely explained the plight of a number of people just i mentioned the fact that the plight of the retirees and the plight of those low income group has got no money for the upgrading with that your reply is that well you are against upgrading but any way it is not for my decision and luckily sir the money don't belong to any one of you here it is the people money and if the people want upgrading you have to give it to them this is what a democratic society is all about sir so my question here is uh before you call for vote in respect of housing board upgrading your flats will be improved and what would be the improvement and then whether whether it would be spread over a period of time and whether in the long run you will have to there'll be no in increase in the uh contribution of only ten percent why not now it would appear that this' another pilot project just like uh the you know kindergarten it's always pilot project you know you use the term pilot project so that you can back back out any time you want wonderful word to use this pilot project and you know speaker sir one note of clarification will you allow me to question him on mr ling you allow sir when the debate comes on the uh you know ministry of uh hdb here a lot of time to explain sir he'll have a lot of time to explain then sir mr speaker he's moved uh cut under my head mr speaker sir now now mr speaker sir i i watched the television last night on a newsreel where they they draw a comparison between the private housing estate to word  upgrading and that of hdb sir i i think it's a very wrong comparison it has no relevance at all sir you must always bear in mind one one factor when a developer bought over old flats they have it upgraded with profit in mind it is for sale so it is very different from hdb flats for all for all you know you can't sell to anybody you want to sell yes that person must be qualified in the first place you know the person must be qualified in the first place and firstly yes but you cannot sell to anybody you want you have problem to mr speaker a point of clarification i think he he must give me a chance to clarify otherwise he make a fool of himself sir sir i i won't sir because even at the last debate i was not given a chance even to to reply so why should i give him a chance to reply now sir i'm not going to give him a chance to reply hey you continue then yes sir sir the the private sector they upgrade they sell to the people sir in in the in the case of hdb flat dwell uh dwellers sir the tenants there sir most of them would be stuck there for good because they would be stuck there for good simply because of this sir because if they sell they will not be most of them will not be able to buy another one because the prices keep going up so it would be beyond the ability of most of the hdb flats to buy that sir but you'll be happier i've to stay in the open air after you stay in open air you know is the is the community uh the develop uh department willing to help these people sir the the next point sir i i won't want to dwell on this sir uh so the next point would be sir sir if i remember correctly sir uh some time back before the introduction of the tax for ps uh that telephone bill sir the government had wanted to give the first number of call free and subsequent to that they will impose a you know for every call they will impose a a a charge on that later on i believe a compromise came about on the total bill the government impose a tax on the bill sir now with the introduction of the time-based system sir i'm wondering why is the tax is still there sir the tax should have been abolished now because it's based on the number of use of the call therefore the tax should be abolished sir thank you sir yes can i take a few minutes just to clarify two points just five minutes just to illustrate that uh obviously uh mr ling hasn't read the papers or try to make himself informed about hdb policies first of all he said that uh an hdb owner cannot sell his flat anybody except to those who qualify but the qualification or the eligibility is so widely defined that more than ninety percent of singaporeans qualify an hdb owner can sell a flat to any pr any citizen there's no limit on income there's no limit on ownership of private private property so this means that an owner of hdb flat can sell his flat to almost anybody in singapore there is no restriction of course it's true only requirement is that the person stays in the flat that he should not buy the hdb flat as an investment  anybody can buy an hdb flat on a second-hand market even if he owns a private property there's no limit on income and he can be a pr or a citizen so this covers almost everybody in singapore aright so he should get this point first secondly on upgrading obviously he has not read i said almost everybody if mr chiam is advocating that a single person should be allowed to buy a five-room flat and i think he should bring it up we can debate that point whether singapore can afford it but i did not say everybody in singapore mr speaker sir i said almost everybody in fact the market is so wide that it should not affect the resale value secondly on upgrading of course all the facts are made available to those who are affected by upgrading how much will be spent on the interior of the flat how much will be spent within the block how much will be spent outside the block and not just their sums but the exact items of upgrading before they're asked to vote and they're not just merely told in descriptive language there're plans there're models there're firms so i think the member before he speaks on this should make himself fully i mean he should inform himself and if he doesn't know about it he should put a question maybe we can gain the clarification but he should not make a speech without even taking the trouble to find out the facts 
Singapore	sir number of uh members have uh spoken on the tax relief for reservists i thought i want to uh briefly respond to some of the points uh firstly mr leong hong kee uh suggested instead of the uh thousand dollars tax relief for active reservists and uh five hundred for non-active reservists that we change to a different system of giving a hundred dollars and fifty dollars flat rate sir there're many different ways of uh providing a tax relief uh the flat rate is one way the method that we propose is another uh mindef is looking into this problem uh fairly extensively over the last year or so uh i prefer the uh method that we propose on a number of reasons on a number of grounds firstly the proposal that we have is symbolic it's it shows very clearly government's deep appreciation and gratitude the reservists for the uh sacrifices that they've made for the contributions that they continue to make uh to the nation's well-being by providing security and peace these are the essentials these are the foundations upon which the nation is able to progress and to prosper sir the method that we propose is also simple and comes closest to what as been uh considered by the uh record committee and uh recommended by the uh reservists i think if mr leong were to look into the uh details and uh look at the numbers he will probably share the uh conclusion that i uh have arrived at namely the proposal that mindef has come out with is beneficial much more beneficial to reservists in the long run because this way as the years go by as the income of reservists increases the amount of uh relief that they get will increase in other words the tax that they pay will be diminished by a bigger margin than the flat rate of fifty dollars or a hundred dollars indeed if  word workers were to have the pay increase by an average about seven percent per year over a ten-year period you'll be talking about almost a doubling of the income and over a forty-year period which is what we are going to give in terms of tax relief to uh reservists from the age of twenty and if they continue working until they're sixty there's a forty-year period that mr leong were to sit down and do some calculations he will appreciate that the uh relief that we are giving is not insignificant so mr chiam has said that the tax relief is too small which does suggest that uh if it were bigger he would have given his uh full support and yet at the same time he says we should not make any uh monetary uh reward any monetary recognition because in so doing if money is involved then we make mercenaries out of our reservists is that right yes sir mr chiam may not be aware of the fact that uh we are already making allowances of all sorts to our reservists we give the key appointment holders a key appointment uh uh holder allowance nd allowance others we have a service uh allowance and uh for all the uh reservists we have a make-up pay does mr chiam therefore suggesting that we take away all these allowances because money is involved sir can i clarify  word  yes <$b < thank you thank you now money are given in all kinds of ways but if you give in a form of a reward then it is wrong in principle but if you give to compensate for his transport allowance for his loss of earning i think that is fair that this this completely different principle payments are made out on a different principles but if there is going to be appreciation you can give him a plaque you can put him on a pedestal and give him a clap or you can put up a statue these these are different kinds these are different kinds of appreciation so we must appreciate what sort of appreciation we are giving and not to dish out money and we say we're happy that you are doing reservist i think that is wrong in principle that is my point sir i think uh mr chiam is entitled to his point of view what we have done is to structure it in a manner that it expresses the nation's appreciation it's a symbolic gesture the amount of money is a matter of difference of uh it's a matter of opinion whether it's large or otherwise but making recognition through a monetary system need not necessarily make mercenaries out of our people sir indeed mercenaries are really soldiers professional soldiers who fight in foreign armies not our own people being paid or being given a uh a a monetary uh recognition indeed armies all over the world pay their soldiers that doesn't make all the soldiers of the world mercenaries so we give allowances to our national servicemen is mr chiam therefore saying that we should not do that sir dr john chen suggests that because mr uh chiam said that he's not in favour of this system we should not uh make uh payment to uh or make the uh system make the uh tax relief available to uh reservists in potong pasir sir i don't think we should do that because i don't believe i don't believe mrs mr chiam speaks for the uh reservists in potong pasir but if there are if there should be any reservist in potong pasir who shares mr chiam's point of view they can easily opt out the system by not making the claim by not making can can i can i have a second clarification are you giving away sir if the if mr chiam will just let me finish the sentence all right mr chiam you can seek your clarification later if any reservist in potong pasir shares mr chiam's point of view and think that recognition through a monetary system is not appropriate they can very easily opt out of it next year by not making a claim it is as simple as that yes mr chiam sir there are two points i want to raise firstly whenever i put up a criticism they will point to potong pasir potong pasir can always opt out where are we going to end very soon there'll be more than one potong pasir and what's going to happen they can all opt out so can if they are not happy with their income tax can they opt out i would like to ask the minister of finance for that if we are unhappy we criticise the income tax property tax can we opt out sir that that is the first point sir the the second point is that sir in in regard to to this whole matter of uh enough or not enough the the whole idea is wrong so it's not a question of quantum the quantum is is no longer an issue it is it is it is it is the principle that is involved so so if you are going to give monetary rewards for service to the nation then where are we going to end because service to the nation cannot be measured by money terms and we all know that public service this kind of things services to charity these are all in the same category so this kind of work we do out of either commitment or either of service or duty to the nation or for the love of it mr chiam are you making a speech or you're seeking clarification mr chiam but certainly it is not for the money that is the last thing in mind sir mr chiam mr chiam obviously didn't hear what i say i say that i do not agree with dr john chen not to make that uh tax relief available to all reservists in potong pasir no but if you speak on behalf of them and indeed if there are reservists who believe exactly as you do which i think will be exceedingly small number then as i said they can easily exercise their right not to claim not to make that claim next year sir i think we've spent enough time on uh mr chiam we move on uh dr ho peng uh mr ho peng he has suggested that uh now we should consider not making available the tax relief for those who have completed their reservist training and also for those who are not doing any reserves uh not uh actively in reserve this is a distinct possibility which we look at uh during the consideration of this proposal uh made by record so what that means is we will only be making a tax relief available for thirteen years because uh most of the reservists will serve a thirteen-year in-camp training cycle and after that after that they will not have not enjoy any tax relief at all so over the last eleven years i've been round the uh army camps the bases i've been into the jungle with our soldiers i've seen them training and i appreciate the amount of effort that they put in i appreciate the amount of sacrifices they've put in i believe that we should express in a manner that is commensurate with the way in which the uh soldiers have put in terms of sacrifices and contribution to the nation for us i have therefore decided that the tax relief will be available even after they've completed their reservist training in other words it's an expression life-long expression on the part of the government for the uh reservists as long as he's contributed in national service as long as he's contributed in reserves he will continue to receive that tax relief or be it at a slightly lower level when they're doing active uh reserve training we give them a relief at a higher level sir there's also a small number of people who for medical reasons largely uh do not uh carry on to do reserves uh after they've finished their ns i've decided that it would be mean it would be mean on the part of mindef not to allow these people also to enjoy the tax relief and therefore i've decided that they too will enjoy the tax relief again at the lower level of five hundred dollars instead of a thousand i will really be splitting hairs to say that reserve service is much more important much more valuable and therefore to be regarded at a higher level recognised by the government but not national service which all of them have completed and that is the basis that is the reason for my deciding to make the tax relief available to all all who have completed national service but for those who are in active reserve to receive a slightly higher level of tax relief so dr john chen and uh mr liew sing paw both uh reservist officers have uh spoken uh positively of the uh tax relief uh our own uh indications surveys had uh shown that majority of singaporeans support this particular relief uh mr liew suggested that indicated that this does give uh reservists a very much higher level of status and i agree with him indeed mindef will be uh liaising with the ministry of defence to uh encourage the ministry of defence i beg your pardon mindef will be liaising with the ministry of finance to encourage the ministry of finance to put a star next to the names of all reservists  people with a star will enjoy the tax relief for life as long as they're working as long as they're contributing towards singapore's prosperity thank you sir mr chiam: sir may i word an order sir sir just now mr john chen spoke up in favour of the tax relief now i was not aware that he was an active officer it's just just been told that he was an active officer he should have declared an interest because he's going to get money for interest mr speaker: yes mr hu mr chiam: he's going to get monetary rewards mr word : can i make one point of clarification mr speaker: yes mr word : i think i was misunderstood on one point i was uh talking just now about those people who have done ns but do not do reservist because they're exempted from health i think uh the minister of defence has covered that point which i i take i did not actually argue a case for not giving a tax relief for those who have completed reservist i fully agree that those who have completed reservist should enjoy some form of tax relief which is a case here dr yeo ning hong: sir i covered that point but uh maybe i just repeat it once more uh if you give if you give those who have served who have completed national service and has served in the reserves thirteen years of tax relief and then carry on until they are sixty or sixty five then in effect you're giving them tax relief for forty or more years but for those who have completed national service but for some reason or other mainly medical do not carry on to do reserves you are basically saying that they are entitled to nothing it's too big a discrepancy you're putting too high a value on the thirteen-year cycle uh reserve uh service and ignoring completely the contributions that they've made during national service sir i believe that is splitting hair it's unrealistic to say that reserve service is much more valuable and therefore have to be recognised in a much more uh uh dramatic manner than national service because national service is duty i prefer to put it this way they have served they have served their national service many of them go on to serve in the reserves for thirteen years because they have done that the government is is grateful the government reflects the nation's gratitude for their sacrifices for their contributions and because of that i'm prepared indeed i was prepared and urged the government to be generous in making sure that the tax relief is available for life mr chiam: may i make a further clarification why should the government be grateful it's the people of singapore that should be grateful dr yeo ning hong: that's what i said on behalf of the people mr chiam: the soldiers are defending the country the whole country and it is for the whole nation to show appreciation and respect for them and it is not the little group of people who call themselves government they don't serve this little group of people who call themselves government they are serving the nation they are in fact defence of the whole nation so why do you say the government is grateful and she must show appreciation dr yeo ning hong: sir i think time is moving on sir the government must obviously sir the government must obviously be representative of the people we operate a democracy in case uh mr chiam is not aware of it we were elected by the people to represent the people and the government acts on behalf of the people and as i said earlier we reflect we reflect the government reflects the nation the people's gratitude and appreciation for the reservists and for the national servicemen's sacrifice and contribution you repeat exactly what i say and you're just saying it again and again mr speaker: order i think we've gone on this point long enough we can continue in the committee of supply mr goh 
Singapore	 live from parliament 11 march '92 wednesday  withdraw his amendment word  amendment number two thirty minutes mr chng mr chairman sir i beg to move that the sum to be allocated for head to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code fifteen hundred of the main estimates sir my subject is uh fixing of airline fares sometime last year about twenty airlines which fixes air fares in singapore in a cartel called the intra-marketing program collapsed in the process uh air fares to london were literally halved what it was but for the last several years in nineteen uh eighty nine there was a different program called market development program which again form a similar airlines uh to regulate set minimum prices for air fares all this fixing of air fares out of singapore is to the disadvantage of the consumers the singaporeans especially this fixing of air fares leads to ridiculous word  whereby it's cheaper for malaysians to travel from kuala lumpur to singapore and to london than for singaporeans to travel from singapore to london all because of price fixing in singapore sir i don't think this uh switching is tenable i believe that the minister should do something about it perhaps let me quote what he said in uh fifteen of january nineteen ninety in reply to question on deregulation of uh the oil prices uh may i quote from word  sir he said at that time deregulation encourages competition among oil companies it forces them to operate efficiently and to be more responsive to the needs of the consumers it allows the free market to determine the real price for the product and it's therefore fair and economically rational the government does not regulate the prices of food transportation or other basic necessities in singapore the competition to bring down prices and prevent profiteering so my question to the minister is that this fixing of airline fares has been going on for a long time to the disadvantage of consumers and my uh particular question is also a general one is if in the event whereby a fixed number of suppliers of goods comes together fixed prices to the disadvantage of consumers like if oil companies come together to fix all the prices what will be the ministry's stand whether he will apply administrative pressure or will he move a bill in parliament to prevent this happening sir question is that the sum could be allocated for head or now head could be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code a fifteen hundred of the main estimates mr khoo mr chairman sir i'll like to declare my interest i'm a staff at the uh ntu with the views i express today will be entirely be mine sir the government has already committed to giving more money for r & d eventually up to one percent of gdp and and uh in the near future up to five percent of gdp this money can be a force for jacking up productivity or it may be so much money down the drain how to measure success and failure in r & d is very subjective let me draw two parallels across the pacific ibm in america and sony in japan both companies are renowned for their industrial prowess their empires stand the globe and their names are synonymous with creativity inventiveness and profitability until lately of course last year ibm lost money the ideas and products did not set the world on fire often they lost to products and ideas coming out from the american research backyards and then in spite the fact that big blue spent us six billion dollars for r & d about fourteen percent of singapore's gdp i repeat fourteen percent of singapore's gdp and that on one item mainly uh infotech can we spend one percent of our gdp and hope to succeed in everything from biomedical technology to engineering to botany chemistry i think we must find uh some market niches and not spread our resources too thinly but i want to ask the people question is ibm's r & d achievement a success or a failure some would say that it is a resounding success look at the results in the eighties ibm won won two nobel prize winners she has filed over thirty three thousand patents and her researchers have published thousand and thousands of academically acclaimed and cited academic papers along the corridors of their research lab hundreds of hi-tech wizards are peering the telescopes looking for tomorrow's solution apparently forgetting today's needs sir can we afford the ideal model if we cannot i'll be looking elsewhere i suggest if we're looking elsewhere we look at japan's sony the world's most inventive and creative company how they do r & d and how they motivate their r & d staff should be an inspiration for singapore for three reasons first their r & d is market-driven and success means the ability to translate an idea into commercial success in other words there's a return on investment second the technology level in singapore is closer to to sony's than to ibm's and third to me the most important their expenditure sony's expenditure in r & d is something we can achieve last year sony spent one point five billion us dollars five point seven percent of their revenue were about three point five percent of our gdp singapore's gdp those figures are realistic for us within a short term reach of singapore's r & d plan sony's re achievement is remarkable fortune magazine calls sony's r & d engineers the world's most prolific and innovative everyday they turn out four new products sir i think there's a lesson in sony's r & d that we can learn and that the best auditing tool for r & d lies in the market that's why sony succeeds and ibm hasn't succeeded so well i wonder if the minister for trade and industry agrees thank you othman mr chairman sir my subject is measures to check inflation mr chairman sir workers are generally very anxious about increases in cost of living uh stated in the economic survey of singapore nineteen ninety one most of the inflation in nineteen ninety one was due to domestic factors unlike external factors which are beyond our control government can work out an interim measure to check domestic sources of inflation and particularly profiteering i would like to ask the minister to outline what measures his ministry has to check the rise in the cost of living sir although our inflation rate is low compared to other countries our current rate is high compared to the average rate for the last five years we saw low rates of inflation in nineteen eighty seven to eighty nine many increases which led to high inflation in nineteen ninety one were introduced in nineteen ninety for example the increase increases in the cost of transport mrt fares bus fares and so on and for nineteen ninety two there are new levies i think members of the house have uh mentioned many of these new levies now there is also this increase in the water conservation tax on domestic and domestic customers have we considered how much it will add to inflation after all we use water for most daily and many products also use water sir i agree that uh we must do all we can to discourage high and wasteful consumption we import our water however instead of a tax which increase or which can lead to an increase in cost we should consider incentives like a rebate for those who reduce water consumption sir urgent measures are necessary to monitor and check inflation and especially to counter profiteering the minister has just stated that uh we must moderate demands on wages and i think uh stability in cost of living can help to do this thank you mr leong mr chairman sir i've only one card this time it's good sir for last two years every year incik othman harun yusof and myself speak on this subject thereby i think it's my duty to speak on it again now inflation in nineteen ninety one sir last year according to the consumer price index was three point five percent the minister for finance has mentioned yesterday that the strong sing dollar has helped to check inflation sir the fear of an inflationary trend as incik othman has said is always in the minds of the people just today you read the papers in the business times in the back page of the business times the bank of tokyo has predicted that for singapore our inflation will achieve growth this year to three point nine percent and then in nineteen ninety three would be four point five percent while we may not want to believe all these forecasts of economic doom and failures i think it's useful for our minister of trade industry to actually be mindful of inflationary pressures that i'll like to ask again this question this year what measures is the ministry taking to check inflation incik yatiman mr chairman sir singapore's economy had long been known as one that is closely related to trading and services industrialisation and manufacturing expansion were made after separation in nineteen sixty five further development in the sector was made much later further development in service sector was made much later sir compared to other industrialised countries in europe america and japan singapore has extremely short period for development of our local enterprise our initial objective of overcoming massive unemployment and attracting investment had resulted with special emphasis given to the mncs and foreign investors our desire to globalise had resulted with further infusion of capital from big business and manufacturing corporation thus providing highly paid and also highly skilled oriented jobs to our population apart from this we also have government related companies in which the minister had kindly touched earlier which are involved in a number of uh manufacturing and service activities sir despite the existence of this rather harsh environment we have seen the emergence of small and medium enterprises which are beginning to globalise their operation in this respect i wish to thank the minister of finance yesterday for his very elaborate answer on various incentive given to our local smes sir the question of promoting our local enterprise it was raised again and again in this house we are happy that the government had looked into this matter seriously dr goh keng swee the founder of adb had this to say business people do not embark on new ventures for political objective they do so on a calculation of profits and we want to introduce them to develop new industrial enterprises we must make the economic setting suitable for the promotion of this activity that was in nineteen sixty one now the edb annual report stated that there are three thousand international and over seventy thousand local enterprises have set their businesses here it is also important to note that during the same period the south korean embarked on different part of development following the japanese they encouraged the agglomeration of local enterprises provided financial backing and called in the expert to build their local giant enterprises these are the enterprises together with their smaller feeder support enterprises that are seen expanding their operation abroad we on the other hand invited the mncs improve our economic infrastructures and set up a number of government-owned or government-linked corporations in view of the above sir apart from the measures and facilities mentioned by the minister of finance the step by step privatisation of our stat board mentioned by mpi what are the other plans and measures the mpi has in mind to encourage the growth of our local enterprise thank you sir order resumption of the committee of supply on the estimates of expenditure for the financial year first april nineteen ninety two to thirty first march nineteen ninety three  mr speaker head w ministry of trade and industry amendment number two the question is that the sum to be allocated for head w be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code w a fifteen hundred of the main estimates general lee mr lim boon heng: mr chairman sir mr yatiman yusof has uh asked about our strategy for developing local businesses he pointed the difference between south korea and singapore well there are significant differences between korea and singapore firstly south korea has a population of forty three million which is fourteen times that of singapore they also have a land area one hundred and fifty times ours their large domestic market provide the opportunity for the development of sizeable indigenous companies which can take advantage of their economies of scale singapore on the other hand with a small population has had to look overseas for investors in the first step of our industrialisation we brought in foreign capital and multinational companies that have world class technology and know-how and the linkages with foreign markets where they export to and singapore has benefited from the participation of multinational companies in our economic development our local industries have benefitted from the technological transfers new markets and business partnerships with them as far as the local businesses are concerned the array of uh existing schemes have already been uh repeated many times so i will just like to stress one particular initiative and that is the formation of linkages or economic groupings here we encourage our local uh smes to form linkages with multinational companies and with the government-linked companies for mutual benefit so this i hope will be taken up by the small and medium sized enterprises i would like to conclude by pointing out that our small and medium sized enterprises have not been doing too badly since nineteen eighty six their value added per worker in manufacturing has improved by about nine percent a year which is better than the industry average of seven percent so by making use of the many existing schemes available to them and by linking up with the smes and glcs our local firms can hope to maintain and improve their performance 
Singapore	 13 mar ' 92 friday live from parliament  sir i beg that the sum to be allocated for head n be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code n one thousand five hundred of the main estimates mr chairman sir i would like to speak on a subject that has been raised many times both by my parliamentary colleagues and myself i will not bore the house with all the details or the arguments which have been sufficiently dealt with on previous occasions the issue is an extension of medical benefits to the family of female civil servants surely the minister will agree with me that our female civil servants work as hard as and as competently as their male counterparts i'm sure the minister would also agree with me that that at the principal the civil servant or any employer for that matter should employ and reward staff based on their ability and performance and not by their sex the last time this issue was raised the finance minister did give the indication that he may look into this matter at an appropriate time i do urge the minister to give some serious thought and consideration to the request this time i hope the minister will not give me a 'no' for an answer and i look forward to a favourable reply question is that the sum to be allocated for head n to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code n i fifteen hundred of the main estimates dr hu i understand the concern for the member of yuhua uh i can only say 'maybe' in the sense that we are reviewing the whole remuneration package of the civil service and this is one aspect which we will consider ya chairman sir i think the answer is better than 'no' so i beg to withdraw my amendment member given leave to withdraw amendment amendment is withdrawn number three mr heng chiang meng sir i beg to move that the sum to be allocated for head n be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code n fifteen hundred of the main estimates mr chairman under our current system of corporate tax losses of companies are allowed to be carried forward to offset subsequent years profits sir but if there is a change in substantial ownership or rather substantial change in ownership these tax losses are not allowed to be carried forward sir in nineteen eighty eight the rule was modified to allow certain situations of substantial change of ownership in which companies could continue to make use of these tax losses these situations were mainly those of word  such as changes as a result of nationalisation or privatisation or the companies' shares being widely traded on a recognised stock exchange and provided that such changes are not made for the purpose of tax benefit or advantage sir although this concession in nineteen eighty eight was better than nothing uh it still fall short of what is required in the market sir i do agree with the the finance minister that there is merit in not allowing loss-making companies to be tax sheltered but i do feel that there are some group of companies that require some form of relief from this rule in particularly i mean uh young start out companies sir these are companies started by enterprising daring entrepreneurs with good ideas and with the money maybe for their own from their own savings as well as support from their friends but with lots of guts and belief in themselves and their ideas sir for such companies it is quite usual for them to suffer losses in the earlier years especially when they are small difficult to get finance and trying to develop their ideas into marketable products and services often after a while new capital is necessary sir at this stage the poor entrepreneur will normally try to interest a large company to buy a part of the company sir large companies normally were once controlling interest and provided the price is correct tax losses then can become an issue for if the losses can be carried forward it may be worthwhile for the company to take over the majority of the ailing company so because of this issue sometimes the deal falls through but even if the deal gets uh carried through often the entrepreneur has to sell off at a very paltry price my question is this: should we not help such enterprise in singaporeans considering that we are trying to promote entrepreneurship shouldn't he be allowed to recoup some of his losses via a better price if the tax losses can be carried forward even if there is a change in ownership sir in such cases if we do allow the tax losses to be carried forward i think uh we will definitely encourage more entrepreneurship and perhaps more struggling companies with good futures may be saved and who knows sir some of these companies may become your future sias and the keppel corporations so sir i would like to cons ask the minister to consider my proposal of waiving the substantial ownership rule for such companies and in case he is fearful of abuse i can think straightaway of a number of controls for him sir like for example tax losses can only be offset offsetted against profits in the same trade another one could be like the qualifying company should be smaller companies like i've described above so for companies of say uh ten million dollars of shareholders' funds or below and three could be say the limit the tax losses incurred for the say past few years prior to the substantial change in ownership so say for three years sir i'm very sure that there are many others but the purpose of my bringing up these few controls is to show that there are ways of controlling tax loss companies from becoming general tax shelters because i think that is the main fear of the minister sir may i continue my second cut yes yes sir on the second cut first i would like to say that in my constituency besides hdb estates there are also quite a number of private residential estates some new but many old sir with the assistance given by the government for hdb upgrading and the sales of hdb shops to sitting tenants some of my private residential well private estates uh residents have asked me whether the government would also help them to renovate in other words to upgrade their capital assets in other words their residential properties especially with respect to the older properties built in the fifties and sixties sir any assistance in this area means either higher expenditure by the government or lesser revenue to the government and i think the finance minister holds the purse strings and so i think he is the best person to answer such queries whether or not the government would help sir the question is this: should he entertain request for financial assistance from sources other than hdb residents the hdb residents are today highly subsidised by the government in terms of the sales price for their flats in terms of maintenance and running of their estate and in terms of for example the upgrading that the government the is going to go ahead and even the sale of shops to the sitting tenants sir as one of the private estate resident remark: if the government wishes to distribute some fat surely we should teeny weeny bit moreover i would like to add that not all private property dwellers are rich not all private properties are sparkling new bungalows or full facility condominiums there are many old developments some even along the major roads perhaps the minister can consider their request for some assistance in fact if i remember sir in nineteen seventy or from nineteen seventy to nineteen seventy eight there was a garden tax for the maintenance of uh garden tax remission for the maintenance of gardens in line with the garden city concept so here if these old developments are an eyesore it might be worth helping in a similar way sir to prevent abuse it could always be limited to those properties above a certain age and below a certain market value sir i i shall leave the actual numbers to the minister since he has the necessary information to have the correct cut off provided of course he agrees with the idea sir i beg to move question is that the sum to be allocated for head n be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code n fifteen hundred of the main estimates dr hu mr chairman sir on the question of uh carry forward of losses up to now we have been satisfied that the arrangements introduced so far were satisfactorily uh the reason for this is up to now we have received thirty four applications for such approvals half were approved but the rest the ones which were not approved were rejected because there was suggestions or indications that my companies were bought over for tax reasons however uhm mr heng has brought up a different category of companies he's talking about new small companies who face peculiar problems problems peculiar to themselves where a general application of rules applying to all companies big and large might work to their disadvantage i'm prepared to consider looking at this as a special case and uh i will ask officer to examine and perhaps we'll approach mr heng for more details of the suggestions he has indicated and we will certainly consider it the idea is not to penalise companies but to ensure that in the process of granting these concessions that uh the government not taken advantage of but if there are ways in which we can ease the problems of companies by administrative changes i'm quite prepared to do so the second point he's raised is tax relief or upgrading of private residential properties this is a problem which always arises when we give some something government gives some to some sectors of the population the request will be made: why not extend it to someone else and i think it's a fair question but i'll like to point out that the hdb upgrading scheme essentially directed at persons who have who are living in hdb flats who therefore need the subsidies which government grants via the hdb flat scheme without the upgrading process it's it it's likely that many hdb house owners will not have the resources to upgrade some of the older flats both internally and externally and some of them are quite old and we have areas of significant urban decay which is undesirable and the government's program is to correct several things at the same time one is to upgrade the quality of the urban housing in hdb estates and secondly to provide help to hdb residents to increase their asset values whether such programs can be applied to private residential housing is something which i think we need to consider very carefully because the general assumption is that people who live in bungalows or private housing are usually better off financially and therefore ownership of landed properties cannot justify government's help or subsidies in any form other than the beautification greening attempt we we made some years ago however if mr heng can let me know the type of houses he has in mind in his constituency which are in such a bad state of repair where the residents are so poor that some form of is necessary well i'm sure we would be happy to consider mr heng sir in view of the rather positive answers given by the minister i'm very glad to withdraw my cut member given leave to withdraw his amendment yes withdrawn 
Singapore	 13 mar ' 92 friday live from parliament  mr chiam thank you sir for allowing me to speak sir i'm heartened to hear that the recruitment of teachers have improved uh to over a thousand last year but the minister uh perhaps could also enlighten us as to the attrition rate or the drop out rate of teachers from the from their jobs now i'm always concerned in fact every year i bring up this subject of shortage of teachers in our secondary and primary schools uh when there are not enough teachers to go around the teacher-student ratio will naturally be low how i complain of this many times in this house of the class size in nearly all government and government-aided schools uh these class size are too large when they are between forty to forty three and uh pupils in such a class uh can never get effective teaching in particular in these days when the work load imposed on our school children is so heavy the teachers are given very wide syllabus to cover and they have to go very quickly through them and of course the average uh pupils uh would find it very difficult to cope up uh they then they do not do so well in their examinations and their parents get very worried working mothers are left in a dilemma whether to continue working or to stay at home stop work and help their children out in their studies in the past uh normally only those who can afford will employ private tutors to coach their children but in these days when academic qualifications are so important to get good jobs even those parents who really cannot afford to have uh tutors uh tighten their belts make sacrifices and save money to employ tutors to help out their children in their studies so of course this will cause uh greater financial burden on these parents now and the government wants to encourage learning of mother tongues in our schools that is something which i support now but the teaching of the standard of teaching of mother tongue have been dropping in our schools why because there is an acute shortage of teachers and they are too many pupils in the class uh the shortage of teachers is a very basic fundamental flaw in our schools uh the government says that it's trying hard to solve this uh problem uh in fact i think the government has no choice the government should uh sort sort this very uh basic fundamental basic uh educational uh problem otherwise all the talk about edusave and the full day schools will be of little use now last year the institute of edu uh last year the minister said that the institute of education is not producing enough teachers uh well i know the minister is doing everything it can but i hope this will not be seen as an excuse thank you mr low you you wanted to speak no it's under uh head l right no just now i want to seek some clarification from the minister yes you want to seek your clarification uh what is the turnover uh rate of teachers in the uh uh of our of the ministry of education dr tan sir just want to seek a clarification from the senior minister of state i know there is this policy of not accepting graduates who do not have two teaching subjects as uh teachers i was wondering whether the ministry has would like to review this policy because there are i'm sure there are some uh graduates who may not have two teaching subjects for example a graduate in nus history and politics would they consider would the ministry consider accepting such uh graduates as teachers thank you dr tay sir uh turn first to the point made by uh mr chiam uh i've already spoken quite uh extensively about the uh recruitment of teachers to try to meet the shortage situation so i will not repeat myself uhm his point about class size uh is something that he brings up almost every year uh predictably mr chiam has the opinion that uh to have good education you must keep your class sizes small the smaller the better uh i don't know where he has obtained this uh information from i suspect he has obtained it from his western contacts because it is true in uh uk united states they uh one of the key points that had been made by many people is they must keep class sizes small the smaller the better twenty five twenty per class but but does mr chiam that in these two countries in uk and us there is a great deal of unhappiness about education in fact there's a lot of criticism about the dropping standards of education in these two countries and this is a subject which will affect the elections in britain in april and possibly the american elect presidential election in november so i don't think uh he should just simply uh quote or ape something which has been uh widely touted in another place and say that this is a solution for singapore it is much more i think this class size issue is over-rated if you look at japan korea taiwan their class sizes are bigger than ours on a regular basis it's between forty five and fifty per class and i remember visiting a very good school in seoul korea their class sizes were sixty per class they managed to do quite well their their students in fact excel and are held up by the american educationists as examples of students who are doing so well and of a system that is far better than theirs i think we should see these things in balance we have a class size of about thirty six and it varies from year to year depending on the uh the number of classes that are created it has served us well i don't think there has been any uh worry that because of the class size of thirty six you know our school results are suffering in fact each year to the amazement of many people the results seem to be improving this year's 'o' level results and 'a' level results have been the best ever i think what is more important i'm ya are you dealing i don't believe that the class size has nothing to do with the quality of education you don't believe it because because if you have a smaller size of class the teacher will have more attention pay more attention and more time to cater for individual students it's it isn't as simple as that my friend i was going to come with this next point what are what are the key factors for success in school since the mr chiam mr low are very concerned about this what are the key factors of success in school i think first the basic ability of the child is very important the child is endowed with certain abilities that is very basic and important secondly the motivation of the child is important also the child may be very bright in terms of his endowment if he is unmotivated he will not do well he will not pay attention to his studies so motivation is important what are the what are the avenues of motivating the child the school is definitely an important avenue and that's why i said that the principal and his team of teachers are really the core the heart of the school by doing a good job in running the school they are motivating the children under their charge concentrate on their lessons to do well in their eca to do all kinds of things they want them to do but beyond the school motivation by parents is perhaps even more important let me explain why i say this i've just come across a study this is a study of children of vietnamese refugees who are studying in american schools in california to the amazement of everybody these children who speak hardly any english when they start school are doing very well in their schools in their neighbourhood schools compared with american children who are not doing well at all in the schools so studies have been done in this why the same school different children one does well one doesn't do very well there must be some other reason the reason is outside the school they found in their studies that the vietnamese parents of these children pay a great deal of attention toward their children they may not be highly educated themselves many of them are in fact not rich at all they are refugees but they pay attention to what their children do they encourage them they supervise them where they can and as a result of that kind of encouragement the children concentrate on their work and they do well in the american system now what is true of the vietnamese children is also true of children in singapore and anywhere else in the world if there is parental interest if there's warmth and encouraging support from parents even if the parents are not rich even if the parents do not have a high education but they are interested in what their children are doing the children will do better in school that has been proven again and again from many studies is the minister implying that those students who are not doing well or their parents are not interested mr low in future if you have oh sorry  word to raise could you please ask for my permission first all right i think the member should take the whole thing in context not just pick on one point on the other hand it is true that there are parents who unfortunately are very nervous about their children's education uh they are negative in the way they deal with their children i think this discourages the children it shakes up their self-confidence and in fact the children do worse so my advice to parents is to take a positive attitude to be very encouraging and not to use the opposite which is to scold them to criticise them and to compare them with other children and say why is it your you can't do better than them i think this discourages the child the reason may be to help them to do better but the result is the opposite on a subject of turnover of teachers in our schools uhm in fact the turnover rate in our schools is not high uh we have a turnover rate of staff of about two to three percent a year now if you compare that with the turnover in many other industrial in uh economic sectors i think the turnover rate of teachers is quite low uh dr tan cheng bock has asked the question about graduate teachers or graduates who have who do not have two teaching subjects uh i think i have to refer this to the uh public service commission or the education service commission because they are responsible for the recruitment of teachers uh and they also lay down the rules on what is minimum requirement but the reason why two teaching subjects have been put in for graduates is because most teachers can be expected to teach two subjects not just one so it's quite necessary for them to have two teaching subjects yes mr chiam sir can i just one ask one question sir now i thought you have finished can i ask one question go ahead mr chiam go ahead just one one one question only yes go ahead uh i would ask the minister assuming that the school under all conditions are similar and in one school you have got a class size of twenty five another school with a class size of sixty which school would you send your child to  uh may i just uh supplement uh what uh my minister of state senior minister of state has said uhm answer to mr chiam's question i understand it's his favourite question and it's uh something worth debating now in in looking at the education system we have a tendency in singapore to look towards the west us uk and so on and some of the opposition leaders uh members might have been teachers before so they had certain philosophies built into them if you have been following the press uh in uk for example recently they have come up with a new study you know the education secretaries' come up with new study to show that in fact they were for many years for generations influenced so much by this so-called powden report which says you should never teach a child you should let him discover by himself you know you should not even have prop uh uh structured learning and so on as a result of this the education system in uk has been blighted for generations and now they're trying to recover so you must see this in perspective if you want to study and try and improve the education system we must also compare the situation in nuh japan the situation in nuh korea taiwan and so on and as a let me finish first let me finish first as has been mentioned by uh dr tay in fact the class size in japan and taiwan are forty fifty and even above in singapore's case our class size standard size is forty some schools have less in fact the average figure for secondary schools is about thirty six pupils per class now those schools that are less popular tend to have smaller classes the popular ones tend to have big classes sometimes as big as forty four and the results are better uh so it is not so much the class size alone let's not over-emphasise this point if you want to uh reduce class size for example you go from forty to twenty as uh advocated by mr chiam you will have to increase number of teachers by two instead of twenty thousand teachers you need to have forty thousand teachers where do we find the number of teachers and what is the value of so doing i mean if you teach in front of a class of uh twenty or class of forty what's the difference you're teaching right of course if you want to have a interactive method then it's better to have a smaller class size but you must remember that sometimes when you interact with the pupils in fact you may be spending more time with one pupil at the expense of the whole class and that is the problem that's been discovered in the western system the problem also with the western system is that the children tend to be very undisciplined while the teacher is teaching the class would be you know playing basketball behind or something our situation is very different our pupils are very disciplined and they want to learn and their parents want them to learn so we've discovered that in fact with a class size of forty we are doing very well and we should be proud of the results that we've achieving year after year i think we compare very well with international standards and personally i'm amazed at number of students who score straight as in 'o' levels uh 'a' levels and so on 
Singapore	 16 march ' 92 monday live from parliament  h j ministry of community development amendment number one we have twenty five minutes mr abdullah tarmugi sir i beg to move that the total sum to be allocated for h j of the main estimates be reduced by one hundred dollars mr chairman sir in any country there will be families and individuals whose standard of living fall below others because of their low incomes in singapore sir we do not see the crippling poverty that exists in some countries in slums in the streets begging hustling others ours is more subtle but it nevertheless lurks behind the doors of our rented flats official estimates put the number of low income families at thirty eight thousand this is defined as those families whose incomes fall below the minimum household expenditure level of about five hundred eleven dollars for the family of four people some of these families sir are further disadvantaged by chronic and multiple problems in the family thus putting the children at risk children sir are inevitably caught in the poverty of their environments not only economically but also emotionally and socially these families need our help that question is who is to help them my tpc sir states categorically that we do not subscribe to welfare state model as found in many countries in the west apart from the government the community and the families themselves will have to work in concert to address the problems of low income families but still we believe that government will have to play a leading role in setting the tone of this tripartite co-operation in setting the rules in providing the basic infrastructure and in creating the atmosphere where the community will be motivated to help the families to be motivated and the families themselves to improve in this context sir let me touch on the question of subsidies the gpc goes along with the government that mindless injections of subsidies into welfare or those which merely finance consumption should not be encouraged not entertained but sir subsidies which seek to improve those who receive them into becoming more self-reliant and more independent should not be ruled out altogether indeed government should not shy at granting subsidies which aim at these objectives they are needed and they are they also serve as an encouragement to others in the community to come forward and help can the minister therefore elaborate in this house the government's approach to social welfare and to helping the needy in our midst what kinds of assistance is it prepared to render to those families and how is it encouraging vwos or voluntary welfare organizations and the community sir i beg to move question is that the total sum to be allocated for h j of the main estimates to be reduced by one hundred dollars mr das mr chairman sir i've two cuts can i take them yes mr chairman sir as for my first cut i will just direct one question to the minister that is what is the government doing to enhance sports performance in general and in particular with the forthcoming south-east asian games to be staged in singapore nineteen ninety three are there any special programs to improve our haul of golds during these game sir i move on to my next cut which is which is recognition for national sportsmen mr chairman sir singapore has in the fifties and sixties produced world class sportsmen to name a few well like wong peng soon in badminton ong poh lin badminton ismail maja badminton tan ow liang weightlifting neo choo kok swimming in the eighties and nineties one world class sportsman which we have produced possibly mr ang peng siong and uh no other name comes to my mind why is this so especially when we have better facilities better and more modern facilities now than in the fifties and sixties the reason i believe may be sir that sports or talent in sports is not given its due recognition in singapore sportsmen give their best part of their career or age say from sixteen or in the case of swimmers even younger go up to sixteen to twenty four and then they fade away with no guarantee of a secure livelihood and there are of course other pressures other talent be it academic arts i believe has been looked after reasonably well and this is not the case for sports sir if we want our standard to improve then i believe something should be done not everything should be done by the government but i believe government can lead the way and this can be strongly followed by the private sector sir when ang peng siong wins a gold medal it brings joy and pride to all singaporeans especially when the majulah singapura is played when fandi scores a goal fifty thousand singaporeans roar in ecstasy for all these what do they get ang peng siong now works in a club and advertises for fab sir i think the best of our sportsmen with talent must be nurtured and looked up something is being done for our footballers right now and i think the fas should be congratulated and i think more will be done in the near future sir government particularly the ministry of defence together with private sector companies could help to nurture our talent in sports by guaranteed guaranteeing them a certain amount of livelihood and at the same time allowing them to continue to excel in the sports of their choice i hope sir the ministry of community development and the real minister for sports to look into this aspect thank you mr singh mr chairman sir i would like to support everything that mr chandra das has said sir for some reason we do not do very well in sports when we compete internationally i can understand that for a long time now we have been motivated by a need to succeed economically and that's laudable but we don't really have to compromise on that principle or objective there there is a group of people in singapore very athletically inclined and who for some reason are not inclined towards studies and then don't make it to the university or other tertiary institutions if we don't give them incentives they're not likely to continue to play the games that they excel in with the result that they don't do well in life either in seeking a job and they don't exploit their sporting talents to the maximum now then you therefore what you have is this group of people who are who don't do well in life and at the same time singapore loses out on this pool of talent we've done economically we have concentrated on the arts we have need reaching for other ideals now i would urge the government to pay more attention to sports not only because the sea games is around the corner but because sports has a unique way of bringing people together i've said this before we can do so much better in getting singaporeans to be passionate about our own country than by national day events or by orchard road swings big parties that we have these events are contrived to get singaporeans together and to feel something for the country but there is a there is a way we can do this without having to spend millions of dollars and this is by encouraging our best sportsmen those who are not inclined to pursue a career or to to take their studies further to concentrate their talents where they have them on the field for example football my colleague has said fifty thousand people are cheering no doubt a lot of them have other motivations they've got money on the game perhaps but there is this other group a huge majority who derive including me a tremendous amount of satisfaction and pleasure when we win and when you cheer you're cheering for singapore and everybody identifies with the country for once there is a lot to be said about government taking the lead in setting aside a few jobs for the athletically inclined so that they can attend to their jobs from nine a.m. to three p.m. and then get out to the fields and concentrate on their sporting talents build a great team in soccer in any other sport and get out there and compete internationally and if the government takes the lead the private sector will follow if we don't do that we'll never get anywhere in sports sport is a unifying force we should concentrate on it thank you sir yeo thank you mr speaker sir first of all i'd like to thank my uh three colleagues who've spoken up on the first cut sir mr tarmugi has asked about what is the government's approach to those in need he has stated very clearly that the gpc does not subscribe to a welfare state that the members do not subscribe to just throwing money at the situation sir the government's approach to social welfare is the many helping hands approach involving a partnership between government and the various civic community and welfare organizations sir social welfare issues are difficult issues to deal with in any society long term vision and perseverance are necessary and it require a painstaking effort and the results only show up many years later similarly welfare assistance programs which go wrong are very difficult to unravel we've seen many countries in which this has happened they started off with very good intentions but end up only aggravating the problems instead of solving them for example many countries have unemployment benefits very generous ones to help those who are temporarily unemployed what happened is that all these programs instead ended up encouraging people to stay unemployed in america the welfare programs started off also with very good intentions with very manageable budgets today social security and welfare is the largest single item in the us federal budget taking up more than one third its budget we therefore are on good grounds in being very careful sir our focus in our social welfare programs is to help the needy get back on their own two feet tax payers' money goes only into programs which are designed to motivate and help them to become independent rather than to dampen their drive to be independent sir our experience shows that giving money for example through our rents and utilities uh scheme alone is not adequate we had let me quote a case we had a case of a thirty eighty thirty eight year old divorced lady with two schooling children who are temporarily on the rents rent and utilities assistance scheme for six months she was first working as a night-shift uh worker because she thought that that way she can help look after her children in the day-time but she was not earning enough money and also because after working late at night she's really too tired in day-time to help to look after the children so she left and got a part-time job as a cleaner it paid even less as a result she was in arrears in her uh pub bills and in her hdb rental payments so hdb referred her case to the council of social services which administers the ruas scheme the rent and utilities assistance scheme vouchers were then given to her to help her tide over pay her financial difficulties but over and above that a social worker from the asian women's welfare association helped her to look for another job which paid her more and at the same time helped her to spend more time with her children she was given counselling on how to budget how to manage her time and the association also arranged tuition for her son as a result she managed to manage her financial her funds better and uh she requested to take off to be taken off the raus scheme after six months  so the the aim of our program is to help them cope with the demands of everyday living which means how to earn how to how to find a job how to manage the funds how to save for rainy day and very important how to help your children sir helping the needy is most effective when it's done at the local and the community level this is because community organizations have the flexibility to provide the individual individual ? attention which is very necessary when helping the very wide spectrum of people who are involved government departments cannot do that this way with the help of voluntary organizations we have a better chance to help the needy to level up because we can tap on a much wider spectrum of resources sir we therefore appeal to more civic community and religious groups as well as corporate citizens and corporate and uh sorry individuals to come forward to volunteer their time effort and resources there're different outreach and broader outreach would enable us to provide a more comprehensive uh scheme and more comprehensive range of assistance to uh those who are in need of help sir on the part of the government we will support and enhance this community bonds and the network of social services what we can do is that we will fund the welfare organizations by providing eighty percent of the funds required for the capital investments and we would also provide fifty percent of the recurrent cost incurred by them and for this purpose we have set aside seventy five million dollars over the next three years to finance the eighty percent of the construction costs of new welfare facilities and the support for the recurrent costs would cost us sixty three million dollars over the next three years and in the pipe in the planning pipeline we have children's homes sheltered workshops day activities centres for the disabled family service centres and homes for the aged sir our social welfare efforts go beyond providing the financial support to the to the needy we must go beyond that to enhance and expand the network of welfare and community volunteers this way we can then effectively assist the needy to break out of their unfortunate situation 
Singapore	 16 march 1992 live from parliament  mr chairman sir in singapore we do not really know the extent of the population that have disabilities using an estimate of three point eight percent used by asian countries such as hong kong and japan there are about ninety seven thousand disabled people in singapore the services for disabled people provided by the voluntary welfare organizations cater only for about eight thousand disabled people the question is are we doing enough there are four areas which i would like to touch on firstly a national registry of disabled persons despite the shortcomings of the previous central registry of disabled persons i believe that the ministry should set up a national registry of disabled persons for this registry to succeed the referral process must be made simple and the referral sources identified sources of referrals should include hospitals school health services maternal and child health clinics polyclinics and schools without a proper database it will be difficult to project manpower needs and plan for infra-structural needs by making the referral process easy and by increasing public awareness of the registry the government will be able to get a better approximation of the incidence of disabled persons and the different disabilities involved this will be extremely useful for future planning secondly educational and training programs currently there are insufficient special schools the vocational training in sheltered workshop programs are limited and there's a shortage of trained staff what plans do the ministry have in overcoming these shortcomings thirdly national coordinating centre for the disabled the ministry should work with the singapore council of social services in setting up a coordinating centre for the disabled which will employ full-time staff the centre will maintain the registry coordinate the activities of all government and voluntary associations providing for the disabled and plan for future infra-structural needs lastly activities of daily living to facilitate the disabled in their integration i'm heartened that in many places the buildings have been designed to cater for the needs of those who are disabled we can do more for example mcd should coordinate with the hdb to help disabled persons who apply for hdb flats to obtain flats that are at that to obtain flats that are at the ground floor or at the same level as the lift we must do more for fellow singaporeans who are disabled what plans do the ministry have in facilitating the disabled in their activities of daily living sir i would like to know the minister's views in these areas mr yeo thank you mr speaker sir sir both mr abdullah tarmugi and uh dr michael lim have raised questions on the disabled sir the government's policy towards the uh disabled is to help them to live independently so as in order sorry is to enable them to live independently as far as it's compatible with their capabilities this would enable them to look after themselves as to lessen the burden on the family sir the uh house should recall that in nineteen eighty eight an advisory council on the disabled was formed to recommend uh ways to help the disabled and to help them to integrate into society the council's recommendations covered a wide spectrum of issues affecting the disabled such as prevention of disability special education accessibility and transportation social services and institutional care sir twenty six of the recommendations were adopted by the government for for implementation and these are now in the various stages of implementation and would be of great help to disabled to the uh disabled sir historically the voluntary sector has been in the forefront of provision of services for the disabled they have done extremely well and should be con should be encouraged to continue to do so we will assist them as far as possible to provide improved and expanded ah programs now through the concerted efforts of both government and the vwos a wide range of services and facilities have already been implemented this include special education vocational training and rehabilitation vocational assessment and job placement production at sheltered workshops day-care hostels and residential care mr tarmugi has asked in terms of what are we providing to the uh to the disabled sir we've set aside about twenty two million dollars as capital grants for the further development and upgrading of facilities for the disabled for the period nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety four twenty two million dollars over the over the five years and we will also support these vwos in their recurrent expenditures as such funding would amount to forty seven million dollars over the next three years sir we would be helping the vwos to establish two more residential homes for the disabled one production workshop one sheltered workshop two day-activities centres one hostel and two multi-service centres some of these are already in the process of development sir in terms of the uh special education for example they are already currently thirteen special education schools with enrolment of about two thousand five hundred children and uh the government provides a grant of four thousand six hundred dollars per student which is twice the cost of the regular primary school education program sir dr michael lim has asked some other specific uh questions also he has asked that the sources that are in terms of having a referral service for the disabled and that we need to set up a uh centralized referral system and registry and that such the cen such a centre can then be a co-ordinating centre for the disabled sir at the present moment there's a very loose arrangement for referring disabled people for help for example there are referrals uh systems whereby disabled are then referred either to the vwos that are involved in helping the disabled or they're referred to the various centres for the aged sick like for example the uh home nursing foundation has a senior citizens day-care centres that also help the disabled recover from strokes for example uh we also have community day uh based day-care centres which help which uh provide help to such disabled sir the council of social services will be undergoing some changes in the future and they would specific committees to focus attention on different groups of people that require help so they will have a committee which will focus strictly on the disabled and this group will then be able to study into what are the best ways to reach out to the uh to the disabled and what sort of help to provide to such people so i think with the setting of this unit in the uh council uh in the near future would be able to have a more effective method for compiling such data sir the in terms of training programs there are training programs available for the disabled already for example uh vitb already conducts training programs and uh hundred and three disabled people have been able to take part in the uh regular vitb programs for those unable to take part in the vitb programs the uh vwos do have training programs of their own for example the vocational school for the handicapped uh offers training programs and uh there're also uh sheltered workshops offering skills training as well as pre-employment training the singapore council of so social service has also set up a centre called the bees link centre which has a centralized vocational assessment service as well as a job placement centre the uh the bees link centre also operates a production workshop employing disabled people who have potential but who face some difficulties in getting jobs for the time being so there are enough training uh places available in terms of uh of the number of workshops there'll be more that'll be set up sir he's also talked about barriers to the disabled physical as well as emotional barriers sir the government together with the vwos have been conducting educational programs and public awareness programs to raise the awareness of both the public and more importantly employers in terms of providing in terms of being more sympathetic to the uh to the disabled and to offer them employment the point specifically brought up by mr tarmugi that what the disabled are looking for are opportunities not just sympathy so a there're various programs that are available to help the employment in employment of disabled people the bees link centre as i mentioned has the uh job placement centre the centre has already placed out two hundred and twenty seven uh disabled people in uh various companies there're also other schemes for example uh the there's a scheme whereby employers who are taking in disabled people are helped through a subsidy that's provided by uh that's provided by the singapore chinese chamber of commerce and industry under this scheme employers who employ disabled ah can have the first one and a half months salary of the disabled paid through a fund which is provided by the chamber uh so this this way it allows the employers who are who have never had the experience of employing disabled to take in disabled for a trial period and they're assured that for the first one and a half months the salaries are borne by this fund we also provide tax incentives to employers who make work site modifications in order to accommodate the uh disabled so in terms of direct help to employers in terms of providing training for the disabled and in terms of providing a placement service all these are already there and uh i'm sure the vwos will be looking into more ways of enhancing such programs in the future in terms of physical barriers sir the government does advocate a barrier-free environment uh within the community for the uh disabled and the aged this led to the government incorporating the accessibility code into the building control regulations in february nineteen ninety in order to promote a barrier-free environment the government also formed a coordin coordinating committee to provide a comprehensive barrier-free environment under the ministry of national development i think members would have noticed some of the uh decisions and programs which have been implemented as a result of this uh policy you've seen the public walkways in the city for example are being modified so that ramps are provided allowing our handicapped to get on to the walkways without having to uh move up the uh the step uh now he has also mentioned about hdb flats sir hdb has also been very supportive the hdb has already formulated guidelines on uh incorporating barrier-free features in its in its estates the new hdb blocks in the future will have uh provision wherever possible for improved linkages with adjoining blocks there're also there'll be also more blocks where you have lift opening on every floor uh the lift lobbies would have ramps to facilitate movement of wheelchairs and the lift size would be wide enough for the wheelchair so this this would help disabled who are are moving around in wheelchairs sir hdb has also uh made provisions which meets what the member has asked for that is an applicant or a family member who is medically or physically handicapped will be able to uh be considered for priority allocation of a floor uh for a flat on a lower floor as well as a flat on the lift landing floor so this has already been uh incorp been uh implemented already sir so i think in due course the disabled will find that moving around would be a lot easier than compared to let's say five years ago when uh more ramps are available and more uh of the barriers are are removed i think i've i've replied to most of his points under the under the disabled sir i move on to the aged population both mr tarmugi and dr michael lim have also have spoken on the aged  sir the aged is an issue which should concern all of us that is because our aged population will increase very significantly today only nine percent of our population are aged above sixty by the by the year twenty thirty about one in four of our population would be above the age of sixty and one there'll be one aged to two persons in the working age group of fifteen to sixteen so i think this is a problem which is of uh which will have great significance uh and great and and uh many implications for society in singapore now what is heartening and important to note is that fortunately most elderly are actually healthy our studies show that about ninety three percent of elderly are fit active and healthy only five percent are frail and about two percent are bed-ridden sir because of the large number of elderly that we'll be having in the uh future the responsibility for caring for the aged falls on all of us everyone the family the community the government and the aged themselves sir in lloking after the aged we must preserve the family as the best social insurance for its members because by the year twenty twenty thirty even if we want to we won't be able to find enough economically active people to lookj after the aged because the numbers the number of the uh aged will be so great sir the family setting allows the aged to grow old graciously in familiar surroundings and therefore help them to maintain their self-worth and dignity the our programs are therefore directed towards helping them to live within the community sir mr tarmugi has asked in terms of caring for the aged sick and poor what is the amount of health uh what are we doing in terms of providing health facilities and uh in terms of helping us to meet the needs of the elderly what sort of institutional what sort what are we doing in terms of providing inti in uh insitutional care and in terms of helping them to live within the com the community sir our programs which are aimed at helping the aged to live within the the uh families and the community are aimed at promoting self-help or mutual help because for every frail elderly there'll be at least twenty fit and healthy elderly so whilst we have very few working people to help look after the elderly in the future we must not forget we'll have a large number of very fit and healthy uh older person who should then participate in helping to look after themselves sir the success of our programs to help the aged depends on uh how the public perceives and perceives the aged in the process of aging and how they accept the aged i think there's a tendency to perceive the aged as being sickly dependent and decrepit we must change such an sttitude if we are going to be able to encourage more members of the public to come forward to participate in uh providing assistance to the uh to the elderly so what the gov the government is doing is that we are having a annual public awareness and public educaiton program on the aged in order to enhance the level of awareness of the population now the highlight of this program is is our senior citizens' day and uh i'm glad to say that the program has been quite successful because the level of participation in our senior citizens' day's program at both the national and the constituency level are have been increasing sir in terms of for the aged relief alone my family run uh my ministry runs a befriender service scheme which helps to recruit volunteers and matches them to the senior citizens the volunteers befriend advise and assist the aged to cope with their daily demands of living within the community because it is important for us to encourage and to assist the elderly to live within the community and to only be uh obtaining institutional care as a matter of last reort in line with that we also have the uh home nursing foundation assisted by the ministry of health which provides a home nursing service and trains members in the care of their aged dependents we also provide uh screening and medical counselling in such centres sir the singapore action group of elders uh also has established a hot-line and counselling service for the aged and uh they are able to provide advice counselling and referral uh services for the elderly who are who are who require such services mr speaker: mr yeo we are running out of time on this amendment mr yeo cheow tong: okay yes sir mr speaker: you you mr yeo cheow tong: sir so in terms of helping them to live within the community we have a lot of programs in terms of institutional care we will also be there're there're already adequate nursing homes and uh other facilities uh we will be helping the vwos increase the number of uh places in the homes to meet the requirements for the for the coming yeasr by funding eighty percent of the cost of these new facilities in terms of uh recurring expenses we will also be helping them sir we we will therefore be making sure that we have enough institutional uh facilities uh to to help look after those who require institutional care sir let me move on to uh the issue of public assistance sir the public assistance scheme is meant to help the financially distressed to regain their independence it's not meant as an unemployment retirement or disability allowance sir we grant uh allowances to the aged destitues the disabled and the chronically sick the orphans and the widows sir the the scheme has to be stringent i know members are not very comfortable with or some members are not comfortable with that but our scheme has to be stringent in order to encourage the able body to re to uh rely on themselves and not to rely on the dole sir if we don't that don't do that then i think we 're heading down the slippery road to uh disaster on no one in singapore is denied the opportunity to apply for pa sir but whilst we open the door for all to apply i think we must be careful to ensure that whilst we have a soft heart we don't have a soft head because as dr lim has mentioned some members in his constituencies feel shy about applying they feel that it's a shameful thing to do sir i think it's not at all a bad emotion because if they are if they feel that it is degrading to apply and therefore they re they are able to rely on their own other mechanisms as well as to rely on other organizations to help them i think it's a it's a very good thing we should dr michael lim: speaker sir can i just clarify well uh my point is that uh they've actually applied and uh they have uh actually been interviewed and have been accepted for the scheme but uh because of the following the interview they felt that it was as if they were begging and therefore they declined their assistance and came to us for assistance but our assistance is limited mr yeo: but they've gone ahead to apply and they have been interviewed then why have they withdrawn the application sir the the key thing is now the key thing is we want to be sure that only those who are genuinely in need and who are unable to find other forms of assistance apply for pa assistance that must be the basis and for those who have applied they we must subject them to some interviewing to ensure these are the genuine cases i think there's no other way sir for us to sort out the genuine from the non-genuine but i can assure uh members that the interviews are done very professionally they're non-threatening they're in no way meant to embarrass the applicants and also the data and information gathered are treated very confidentially sir when i'm when i uh went into mcd i made sure that all rejections were seen by me to ensure that the rejections were valid i'm glad to say that in all rejections in in all rejection cases while i was in mcd and before that the uh rejections were valid because the applicants really upon investigation were found that they have either adequate savings of their own or they were actually being supported by their families by their children relatives so all the cases were rejected on good grounds sir mr speaker: mr yeo mr yeo: sir but nonetheless mr speaker: would you like to wind up your answer mr yeo: okay sir what uh what we want to stress is that the pa scheme is adequate we do review the rates we do ensure that the the uh pa allowances are adequate to ensure that the pa recipients are able to survive and more moreover more importantly we also on top of the pa scheme are able to draw on other resources to help the uh recipients dr michael lim: uh speaker sir can i just add one last statement uh it appears it appears that my twenty nine year old uh housewife with three children will not find solace in your answer uh perhaps uh minister before he just ends would like to make a comment about the proposal i made with regards to the widowed woman with the children mr yeo: sir i'm not familiar with his twenty nine year old uh widow the case of the twenty nine year old widow if he feels that the the uh widow has got good grounds he shoudl as mp write in to reappeal and i'm sure my my my ah offi officials would uh reconsider in terms of his uh his suggestion that we we channel the pa grants through the cccs sir i'm that in the first place that his ccc uh was able to provide some help i think that's a right way to go the the payment of the pa allowance through the posb is a very convenient one it imposes no inconvenience on the recipients mr speaker: mr yeo i think you've answered mr dr lim already mr tarmugi is member given leave to withdraw his amendment amendment withdrawn 
Singapore	 17 march 1992 live from parliament  amendment number seven mr ho sir i beg that the sum allocated for head r be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code r fifteen hundred of the main estimates sir the arts and culture in singapore is undergoing a renaissance there is a long awaited and welcomed breath of fresh air the national arts council has in a short six months been catalytic in in in initiating new activities and raising singaporeans' awareness of the arts to greater heights all these augur well for singapore for culture and the arts are windows to the soul of a nation they have a unifying effect a rallying call when we speak of enhancing the quality of life of singaporeans an avowed aim of the next lap a development of the culture and arts is a vital component activity as a university don i've long recognised the abundant creative talent in singaporeans particularly our youths i'm extremely pleased that this talent is increasingly becoming evident having the space to flower and bloom but sir what does all these mean for the average singaporean our mr or miss hdb i feel that it is important that appreciation and enjoyment of the arts is not seen as a prerogative of the well-off or educated it must not become a divide among singaporeans as golf once used to be arts and culture should unite us not divide us i therefore like to ask the minister what steps have been taken to make enjoyment of the arts opened to all also wish to ask him three other questions firstly what is the ministry's position on culture and artistic offerings in the dialects i think we read in the papers of a certain uh group wanting to hold a large-scale international cantonese opera in singapore and another and another group wanting to outdo the first group by holding a subsequent one on an even larger scale and a teochew week has been held in singapore think these will increase so that some guidelines will be helpful a related question what is the ministry's position on the screening of dialect programs on subscription tv in the future secondly what does the minister see as future developments in the cultural and arts scene in particular what is the role of the national arts council and thirdly in what ways can the business community professional associations community groups and the people of singapore in general give in terms of greater support in arts and culture thank you sir question is that the sum to be allocated for head r be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code r fifteen hundred of the main estimates mr choo mr chairman sir in mandarin mr ho mr chairman sir let me first respond to the honourable member for sembawang grc mr ho peng kee but before i do that i wish to declare my interest i am an amateur artist as an artist i definitely welcome what uh has said by the honourable member for sembawang grc as well as the honourable member for uh jalan besar grc sir with the economic success over the years we can now afford to divert our attention and channel a bigger chunk of our resources in the promotion of the arts sir in singapore we are fortunate to be heirs to fine traditions from both the east and the west these uh shape and enrich our culture and social life sir our multi-cultural heritage provides a good foundation for a singapore identity of course it will take time by many who are familiar with the local art scene the evolution of such an identity is well underway third with the formation of the national arts council under the able chairmanship of professor tommy koh in september last year the promotion of artists given a fresh momentum we can expect a more active art scene in the years to come however the national art council or nca in short alone is not enough the private sector and the arts community must also come forward to form a tripartite partnership in developing singapore into a culturally vibrant city sir the member also asked about the work of nac uh let me briefly answer him sir since uh its inception in last september the nac has successfully completed a few major projects such as the traditional theatre festival and the singapore dance festival sir the nac has recently signed an agreement with the scottish arts council and the regional council to promote cultural exchanges between scotland and singapore singapore artists and art administrators will have a chance to visit and other scottish cities for training and study tours this is in line with nac's objective of linking with the international art community to cultural exchanges program with city noted for the arts sir let me now list some of the programs and activities that ac will implement over the next twelve months festival of arts to be held in june this year singapore art fair in august also this year cultural training with the hong kong arts festival the establishment of an art endowment fund new arts award schemes sir the nac will also step up its effort to widen the audience space as mentioned by the honourable just now it will work with schools to promote interest in the arts among students and with mass organizations such as ntuc people's association and the federation of planned association so that the general public will have a greater access to art activities we hope that with mass participation we will have a better chance of success in realizing our vision for nineteen ninety nine as to the specific uh reference raised by the honourable member sir mita will give uh equal treatment to all art groups and organizations and we provide necessary assistance to them whenever it's required so if one of the group wants to call an international uh cantonese opera and yet another group wants to hold another one we'll we try our best to tell them its' to the best of their interest to com combine or just have a a grand one because uh our audience space is not big enough and if they go on with their projects well good luck to them of course as far as mita is concerned we'll like to give them whatever is needed as for the screen of uh dialect program on on tv i suppose i think it's the policy of the government that the dialects program uh should not be screened over tv because uh it would jeopardize the effort made by the speak mandarin campaign over the years mr ho we're running out of time we still have some amendments yes give me just uh one two minutes to uh reply i give you one minute well well uh let me now turn to the honourable member from jalan jalan besar grc well uh let me first tell the member that in the business called promotional the arts even if you have done a lot there is still a lot to be done but i can assure the members that as well as the house that with the formation of the national arts council greater emphasis will be given to assist local artists and art groups including the promotion overseas as regard the proposal by mr choo to set up a cultural uh village uh i think it's a good idea i will ask my officer to look into the feasibility of such a proposal thank you mr ho sir i thank the senior for his comprehensive relpy and beg leave to withdraw the motion member given leave to withdraw his amendment amendments withdrawn amendment number eight we have ten minutes left i will call on the minister to reply two o five mr ho no sir mr teo number five incik zulkifli sir i beg to move that the sum to be allocated for head s be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code s g fifteen hundred of the main estimates sir under the existing workmen compensation act manual workers are covered by the act regardless of their earnings however non-manual workers are covered only if they earn less than one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars per month this income ceiling for non-manual workers was last adjusted in nineteen eighty from seven hundred and fifty dollars to the present level of one two five zero sir nineteen ninety one report published by npb on productivity and wage growth differentials showed that the wage growth between nineteen eighty one to nineteen ninety averages out to around six point six percent thus it has been twelve years now since the income ceiling for non-manual workers was last revised in my opinion sir there are sufficient grounds for the ministry of labour to review this ceiling i would like to suggest that the ceiling be raised but would like to hear the minister's view on this matter secondly sir i would like to touch on clause three b of the third schedule of the workmen's compensation act of late there appears to be some ambiguity in its interpretation as was evidenced by the much publicised workmen's compensation case involving a worker and the management of sbs which was heard before the commissioner over the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the injured worker although the matter was finally settled through a compromise a lot of unpleasantness and distrust has been generated on the one hand the worker and his union contend that the management in quibbling over the quantum to be award awarded on the other hand the management believed he did the right thing by raising a fundamental question in wanting to know how the quantum was arrived at apparently the ambiguity ambiguity lies in the interpretation of as to what constitutes compensation payable in the case of permanent total incapacity as is proportionate to the loss of earning capacity in the light of this case i would like to urge the ministry of labour to review the same clause and make the necessary amendment so that its provision could be interpreted more clearly to avoid such a dispute from recurring individual sir i beg to move question is that the sum to be allocated for head s be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code s g fifteen hundred of the main estimates dr chen mr chairman sir recently a union member suffered an injury while's at work and was given a total of fifteen days of outpatient medical leave and forty three days of hospitalization leave his employer under the ministry's advice paid him his full salary for his hospitalization leave but only two third for his of his salary for the outpatient leave the ministry's position appears to be based on clause four of the third schedule of the workmen's compensation act which provides that the workmen suffering from temporary incap incapacity due to injuries at work is entitled to full wages for a period of sixty days if he's hospitalized and fourteen days if he is not hospitalized and thereafter to a payment every month of an amount equal to two thirds of his monthly earnings during the incapci incapacity or during a period of one year whichever period is shorter it appears to me that the ministry is treating the full salary entitlement under hospitalization leave and that under outpatient leave as an either-or situation that is if a worker has been hospitalized then he would only be paid full wages for his hospital leave and not his outpatient leave sir i think this interpretation of the law is illogical and erroneous the irony is that if the worker had just claimed for medical leave under the employment act he would have been paid full salary it is therefore unfair that the worker who is injured because of an accident at work should be placed at a disadvantage compared to a worker who takes ordinary sick leave  i'm of the view that the word 'and' appearing in the clause four gives an injured employee the right to claim full wages for both hospitalization and outpatient leave in respect of the same injury subject to the maximum num number of days stipulated sir if this is merely a problem of interpretation i hope the ministry would put it right but if the ministry thinks that its interpretation is correct then the law should be amended to make it in line with the employment act provisions may i have the minister's view on this thank you sir mr speaker: dr ong chit chung: mr chairman sir first i would uh take up the point raised by mr zulkifli the workmen compensation act now covers seventy three percent of the total workforce based on the labour force survey of nineteen ninety one it was last uh revised as far as workmen compensation uh was concerned in nineteen eighty one it is now about ten years and definitely it's time to review i'll like to thank the member for bringing this point up the ministry is actively reviewing the quantum but we have to bear a number of factors in mind for example the impact in terms of cost on employers as they have to buy uh larger coverage in terms of insurance but with inflation and rising cost for our workers and uh we have also to take care of the interest of our workers and therefore we must revise the ceiling upwards the question is how much and we are working on it uh we will consult the ntuc and we thank the ntuc uh members for bringing this up with reference to the uh case uh brought up by mr zulkifli about the sbs case i would like to say that the under the workmen compensation act compensation for permanent incapacity takes into account the loss of earning capacity for every type of employment which the an injured worker was able to undertake at the time of the accident therefore although the injured worker continued to be employed in this case by sbs the compensation awarded for permanent incapacity is meant to take into account the likely loss of earnings which the worker will face if he were to take up any other employment it was on this basis that the injured worker in the sbs case was awarded compensation of twenty four thousand six hundred uh the ministry view is that there is no ambiguity in terms of law and we will ensure that workers are given full protection under the workmen compensation act in this particular case the uh parties concerned came to a settlement amongst themselves but if you go by precedent the commissioner is likely to uh rule in favour of the worker i would like to thank uh dr john chen for bringing up this very important case of the uh smrt i will not uh uh disagree with him i think he has got it correct the ministry has review its practice on making a rigid or fine distinction between hospitalization and outpatient medical leave where there is no evidence of malingering or abuse the workmen compensation department i will assure dr chen will advise employers to treat such outpatient leave as full pay leave up to a maximum of fourteen days i will like to thank him again for bringing this up on behalf of all the workers mr speaker: inche zulkifli mr zulkifli: sir although i'm not quite happy on the answer given on the sbs case but nevertheless i withdraw my amendment 
Singapore	 18 march 1992 wednesday live from parliament ministry of health number six mr das mr chairman sir i beg to move that the sum to be allocated for head p to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code pe one five zero zero of the main estimates mr chairman sir i agree with the government's philosophy there is need for preventive measures to help one remain healthy and what better way to do this than to start at the school level sir i'd like to point out to this house that there are far few doctors uh looking after the school health service i've been informed sir that there are four doctors at the clinics and eleven doctors in the field taking care of four hundred and fifty thousand pupils in our three hundred and fifty primary secondary uh pre-university and junior colleges these doctors are ably assisted by thirty staff nurses and eighteen assistant nurses sir only primary one and secondary four students are screened by doctors the screening at primary six is done by nurses is this because of shortage of doctors and what about the quality of screening for these children at primary six is the ministry satisfied with this level of screening are other programs being sacrificed because of lack of doctors sir i would urge the minister to use his good offices to persuade the finance minister not to apply the zero growth in the case of school health services sir i beg to move question is that the sum to be allocated for head p be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code pe fifteen hundred of the main estimates dr wong mr chairman uh i'm glad doc uhm mr chandra das supports the ministry's phil philosophy that prevention is better than cure and he also supports the objectives of our school health service uhm with regard to the number of doctors in the school health service actually it has increased from uh the number uh from ten in nineteen eighty eight uh to fourteen uh this year and that is in spite of our zero uh growth uh policy uh on the number of nurses in the school health service uh i think he's got the uh figure wrong in fact uh we have now one hundred and four nurses in the whole school health service uh the entire staff complement is hundred and eighty six so so uh it is by no means uh small uh staff complement and our expenditure has increased from five point four million in nineteen eighty eight to seven point three million now whether medical screening uh should be done by doctors all the time uh it is uh a matter of uh you know expert opinion also as a matter of the end result the outcome it is true that uh medical screening carried out uh in uh primary one and uh secondary four are done by doctors while those uh at primary six are done by nurses but our nurses are trained you see so and and besides uh our children also get uh uh to have visual screening every year they also get spinal screening you know intermittently so it is not just the medical screening at primary one primary six and secondary four now uh actually our children are very healthy and they are amongst the healthiest age group in our population uh if by the time they enter primary school uh if they get very uh any severe medical condition they would have been picked up by our uh medical services before they enter school and even during the school years those requiring specialist attention would have been sent to specialist outpatient clinic in the institute of health uh and uh actually attendance uh attendance figures in our polyclinic show that the proportion of uh school children seeking medical treatment at polyclinics uh is much lower than the other age groups so all indications are that the present kind of medical screening services we give at uh at in in our schools uh is adequate it is better to utilise uh our scarce resources in other programs but of course i welcome uh his support uh uh uh you know for our program to be receiving more funds uh from the ministry of finance but uh please rest assured uh uh in the opinion of medical uh experts i think our school health is doing a good job mr chairman sir since the minister of state welcomes my suggestion i think the ministry should work harder to get more staff on that note sir i beg leave to withdraw member given leave to withdraw ay ay yes withdrawn amendment number seven dr michael lim sir i beg to move that the sum to be allocated for head p be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code pe five one o o of the development estimates primary health care is currently considered a poor cousin of hospital services but i believe that it is as important if not more important as secondary and tertiary health care a good primary health care service will result in early detection of diseases and prevention of complications in developing new polyclinics we must not only continue to make it affordable but we must strive to improve the level of primary health care i have uh certain proposals which i would like the minister to consider one install x-ray facilities in all new polyclinics the ministry should consider installing x-ray facilities not only to improve the diagnostic capabilities but also by allowing general practitioners to use the x-ray facilities the level of primary health care in that area will be enhanced furthermore with a higher word it will result in more cost-effective use usage of the facilities number two set up rehabilitation facilities at all polyclinics this will allow patients with stroke orthopaedic injuries and other physical disabilities to have easy access to such facilities otherwise the physical disabilities alone will discourage them from travelling to the hospitals for rehabilitation early rehabilitation will allow the patient to integrate back into society and will relieve the social burden of family members thirdly medication patients seen at hospitals are discharged at polyclinics for follow-up when they are stable however in certain instances these drugs are not available at the polyclinics and there's no alternative drug within the same class of action available in the polyclinic as a result cfc card holders do not want to be discharged from specialist clinics as they are unable to get the medication required i propose that the ministry allow polyclinic doctors to make an indent for non-standard drugs for cfc card holders who require medication currently not available in the polyclinic pharmacy these requests should only be allowed if the patients are sent to the polyclinics from specialist in government and restructured hospitals this will make it unnecessary for such patients to be seen at the specialist clinic and hospitals just for the sake of being able to obtain the required medication lastly i quality of medical care at this point i would actually like to agree with dr tan cheng bock who said that there were certain problems about primary health care system i think one of the weaknesses and a very important weakness of our current system in the polyclinics is a lack of continuity of medical care patients with chronic medical conditions like diabetes are often attended to by different doctors at different visits at each visit the harassed doctor scours the medical notes and makes a hurried assessment as he has a large pool of patients waiting in line to see him fighting against the problems of unfamiliarity limited time and a large patient turnover he can only do his humanly best and will not be able to give optimal care for the diabetic patient he can only try to adjust the medication to control the blood sugar level there is no time to look for eye complications kidney complications vascular complications and there is definitely no time to give proper counselling dr lim how does the ministry dr lim intend to improve the situation i would like the minister's views on these points question is that the sum to be allocated for head p be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code p fifty one hundred of the development estimates dr wong mr chairman all our large polyclinics have laboratory on site these are these laboratories are also opened to gps to the general practitioners however the general practitioners' utilization of our polyclinic laboratories has been poor comprising less than two percent of the laboratory workload now this is because some private labs are providing a special service to the gps collecting specimens from them at no additional charge and so gps find it not necessary to send the patients to the polyclinic uh lab now currently only one polyclinic at tampines has an x-ray service which is also opened to gps but again its utilization by gps is very low comprising less than five percent of the x-rays uh taken now uh patients who who are discharged from government uh or restructured hospitals uh the csc card holders or other people can obtain nonstandard drugs at the polyclinics if they are patients of the polyclinics so the idea is that they should be followed up on their polyclinic and if the use of non-standard drugs is warranted then uh an application would be made for the drug to be supplied to polyclinics and at uh uh at the usual cost of one dollar per item up to a maximum of four uh per uh uh per uh now uh the lack of continuous care i think uh we have covered this subject quite well when i responded to dr tan cheng bock's uh uh proposal about uh community health care system thank you dr lim sir just one last point the reason why your lab facilities are not well utilized is not just the convenience but the cost as well in fact it is more costly to do a lab test in the polyclinic than at a private uh lab is that so i would look into it sir uh i thank the minister for her reply and i beg leave to withdraw my uh amendment is member given leave to withdraw his amendment ay amendment is withdrawn sir doc dr tan has given us a very long discourse yesterday on primary health care i'd urge him to please pay more attention to what we are doing so that he he can better understand the whole philosophy because what order let me let me finish sit down please mr speaker sir minister is not giving way sir he's taken a lot a lot of time yesterday more time than he should have no i think but so sit down first come on order order dr tan resume your seat he has spent a lot of time making mini ministerial statements doc dr tan resume your seat please because all that he described is preci are precisely things that we are already doing just that he's managed to call them under different name he's quoted the finnish model saying that we are under-spending without realizing from the data that actually we're spending more than what finland is spending on primary health care sir mr loh was correct primary health care i think we are very well-established but nonetheless i appreciate his concerns and i can assure him that in our future studies and planning for the primary health care i will definitely like to call on him to volunteer his time in helping us to further improve primary health care sir in terms of hospital services i can assure him that we are we also share his concerns in terms of ensuring that we do not over-provide medical services in hospital area and that's why we've been freezing the number of beds for many many years  in fact we've had a freeze for the last seven years on hospital beds and we will continue to gauge very carefully the demand and to ensure that only those who require hospitalization are being hospitalized and more importantly to ensure that only those who require those investigations are being provided those investigations otherwise he's right if everybody comes in with for all those tests unnecessarily we must invest more in e in equipment and that will be very very adverse in terms of doing sir in terms of cfs i understand looking at the cards that some other mps are also maybe talking about that so i'll reply to that later 
Singapore	 18 march 1992 live from parliament ministry of communications  item number two mr charles charles chong uh mr chairman sir i beg to move the sum to be allocated for head i be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code i a fifteen hundred of the main estimates sir i note the minister for communications on the twentieth of february this year released figures to indicate that our sea-port is the world's number one three times over the figures announced by the minister showed that the pas was the world's number one container port and according to the minister singapore is also number one in terms of gross registered shipping tonnage and yet again number one in terms of the number of vessel movements uh sir we just heard the minister remind the house a few moments ago that changi airport is also number one in the world i would like to ask the minister how important or necessary is our current obsession with the number one position uh sir i do not think many singaporeans would dispute the fact that in order to survive and to prosper we need to constantly strive to be better however this obsession with the number one position in some cases may be completely unnecessary for example being number one for rules regulations and fines is definitely unnecessary in other cases being number one may just not be good enough now although the singapore worker's been rated number one in the world for more than a decade it does not mean that we have arrived in fact there are still many areas that must be improved as pointed by by an honourable friend dr ow ching hock a few days ago in this house now sir if in striving to be the best we can be takes us to the top position should we not enjoy being number one in the world a little more modestly and quietly now blowing our own trumpet whenever any survey no matter how in insignificant it rates us as being number one in the world may not have very many beneficial effects it may mistakenly convey the impression on our people that we are already the best that we can be however more significantly it may make us more prominent targets for protectionist measures taken by the less competitive and the more envious who may perceive us to be bigger competitors than what we actually are now perhaps the minister could give us his views on this subject uh mr chairman sir with your kind permission could i now take my second cut however before speaking on singapore's air services agreements i would like to declare my special interest in this subject as an employee of singapore airlines sir in the re in recently concluded air services agreements with other countries we appear to be giving away more liberal traffic rights to other carriers than what we receive for singapore carriers it also appears that despite this very liberal air policy singapore's carriers still face apparent protectionist measures taken by other countries now could the minister comment this issue and let us know what advantage our liberal air policy has on air carriers in singapore and also on the country as a whole sir i beg to move the question is that the sum to be allocated for h i to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code 1 a fifteen hundred of the main estimates mr mah sorry mr harun ghani you can take both cuts okay thank you when telecom introduced new pricing system for charging usage of telephone our level of society felt that the action caused inconvenience to public sir your ministry of communications became a target for this unhappiness however through the survey conducted in december ninety one received seventy three percent of the users would bear lesser than before this relieved the public and less unhappiness heard sir indirectly telecom has succeed into getting the public to be thirsty my compliments to minister of telecommunications further to this i would like to know the information pertaining to the public usage of telephone in months of january and february this year if it is invariable with the finding in december and feedback received than the public will more relieved sir time-based price system indirectly may reduce the profit or may not be profitable to telecom therefore how telecom to reconcile reduction in revenue earned with expansion planned by employing high-technology sir it seem that there is one more point which cause unhappiness to factory employees who are using office telephones those who work in factory will not be allowed uh able to use office telephone it would be better if telecom provide card telephone in factory office so that it can be used by the employees i raise this point because there are factories which want to install card telephone but was rejected by telecom second cut sir permission this year telecom is entering privatization and definitely it will provide big program which requires high-technology equipment and services beside large amount of investment required services of skill level will also play an important role in the excellent services provide by telecom in view of this will the employee be given skilled training or whether they have been trained and ready to excel in providing such services in future what about those who are not able to adjust themselves to rapid expansion of telecom especially long service employees either their services are no longer required or they've been transferred to do tasks which different from their usual job and if their services are no longer required what sort of compensation will telecom provide for them sir telecom intention to sell share to public as uh i think the the dpm already mentioned will not uh uh the idea indeed it's appropriate move and shall be commended my sincere is dead his employee should be given priority in purchasing the share through cpf saving or as to boost the morale of the employees i'm saying this not because my wife is working with telecom it is just coincidence for those who do not have cpf saving this is the time for them to start saving and learn to be for the future and old age sir my hope my hope is that if telecom want to reap large profit through privatization and increase capital expenditure on high technology and equipment the burden of bearing the high cost should not be shifted to consumers only thank you sir mr mah mr chairman sir mr charles chong asked why we are so obsessed with always being the best in the world sir it is my fervent belief that we must maintain this obsession and i use the word obsession without apology sir maintaining a number one position for us is not an end in itself but a means to an end if i can use our sea-port as an example why do we push and why do we strive to keep the port of singapore a number one container port a number one port in terms of shipping and so on sir to remain the number one port is not just a matter of collecting accolades which all singaporeans can be proud of sure we are proud to be the number one port in the world but more importantly is that with this achievement comes not only pride but also very very tangible benefits economically the port creates jobs and it creates wealth for our people there're seven thousand workers directly employed by the pas there're another thirty eight thousand employed in industries which are related to the port last year or in nineteen ninety the pas contributed something like two percent to the national wealth and if we add the port-related industries warehousing ship- etcetera the contribution rises to something like three to four percent of the national wealth so this is something like one quarter of the transport and communications sector's contribution to the national economy so it's not just not not just a matter of being number one for its own sake but striving to be the best and in the process finding that we are the best in the world we are number one in the world and trying to maintain that position there is no reason for us to feel apologetic about it i think if we can do it we should continue to try for it but i have to add that this is not going to be plain-sailing there're other ports that are coming up in the region they are also believe it or not trying to number one they've all upgraded their facilities in the last few years in terms of the kind of business that the port of singapore carries out we have to continue to make sure that we are more cost-competitive than them we are more efficient and we provide the best supporting services if we can continue to do this we will continue to remain as the number one port in the in the region and in the world and we continue to reap the benefits sir the government is aware that the pas must have the necessary support particularly in the area of port capacity we must be able to provide sufficient capacity to handle the amount of cargo that is to come our way so pas is now working closely with relevant government agencies to plan a new container port which will meet the needs of singapore beyond the century and keep us as number one sir mr charles chong also asked about our uh liberal open skies policy i think it is a well-known fact that we have consistently adopted such a policy basically what it means is that while we negotiate air rights on a bilateral basis with different countries we want to have as many of these bilateral agreements as possible once such an agreement is concluded we allow the other countries airline to fly to singapore even if our national carrier has no immediate plans to fly to that country now why do we do this the reason is very simple it brings us many benefits it enhances tourism visitors from all parts of the world can get in and out of singapore quickly and conveniently encourages investment it benefits trade and most of all consumers will benefit from a wider choice of airlines and more convenient itineraries now i sometimes like to think of our airport as a huge bus interchange with flights coming in and out at such frequent intervals that sometimes people would rather come to singapore catch a flight and then go on to their final destination destination rather than go directly because it is faster and sometimes it's even cheaper to do it the this way so while we continue to adopt this open skies policy i must mention the fact that it does not mean that singapore is prepared to give away more than what we actually receive and in this respect whenever we have an air services negotiation it is the overall package of exchange that must be an equitable one and when i say equitable i'm talking about there being a balance of opportunities not a balance of benefit but a balance of opportunities for both sides and the reason why we ask for a balance of opportunities is simply because we know that under such a situation we can compete with the best in the world sir i turn to harun ghani's points i thank him for his concern that uh singapore telecom's profit will be reduced because of introduction of time-based charges i he asked for some statistics latest statistics on telephone usage under the time-based charge if i may present this sir in january nineteen ninety two that is uh january this year under the flat under the flat rate system sir sorry sixty nine percent of the people paid less under the time-based charge than under the flat rate system  so sixty nine people benefited from this conversion to the time-based charge the corresponding figure for february ninety two the last month was seventy two percent the figure for december ninety one which was the first month that the time-based charging system went into operation was very close to this seventy three percent so more or less around the same figure in fact singapore telecom collected less revenue from point six million dollars less in the three months december to february ninety two compared to what it would have collected under the old system sir singapore telecom as i've stated is in the process now of reviewing this time-based charging system and all the views and options that have been expressed will be taken into account in this review and an announcement of the outcome will be made in due course sir when singapore telecom is privatized uh ts will be reconstituted as a stat board and uh the activities of singapore telecom will be overseen by this stat board uh i wish to assure the member that uh the interest of consumers will be safeguarded under the new situation when there is a separate statutory board on the point about unhappiness of private factory employees not being allowed to use the phones uh i'm sure telecom will be pleased to install uh additional coin uh phones for them if they wish to do so uh i think i've addressed the points that have been raised mr speaker: charles chong mr charles chong: uh sir i thank the minister for his answers and i beg leave to withdraw my amendment mr speaker: member given leave to withdraw his amendment amendment withdrawn 
Singapore	doctor balaji could you please give his honour your qualifications my qualifications i'm a m b b s singapore a fellow of the royal college of surgeons glasgow completed a neurosurgical residency in the united states at henry ford hospital and a board eligible neurosurgeon i have a paediatric neurosurgical fellowship from harvard university a what the last bit a paediatric neurosurgical fellowship from harvard doctor balaji when did you first qualify with the m b b s degree nineteen seventy nine and from when have you been involved in neuro surgery from nineteen eighty two and when did you become consultant neurosurgeon january this year in nineteen eighty four were you attached to the neuro surgery department at tan tock seng hospital particularly in september october november nineteen eighty four yes i believe so by that time would it be fair to say that you would have been holding the position of registrar in that department if you got acquainted with neuro surgery eighty two i was trainee in neuro surgery at that time doctor balaji did you come across the first plaintiff jeya wife of akkaiah whilst she was admitted to the neurosurgical unit of the tan tock seng hospital on eighteenth october nineteen eighty four i do not recollect looking after this patient at that time and looking at the record i do not see my involvement in her management at any time at that time so the only occasion on which you saw the first plaintiff was on the twentieth of august nineteen ninety for the purpose of making this report at page nineteen of the bundle yes how long did you see the first plaintiff during this consultation at the out patient dispensary forty five minutes about doctor balaji i may have to ask you a few questions from the records can you please confirm to the court that you have all the records from the hospital in relation to the first plaintiff the records are with doctor lai outside could we have the records i'm sorry your honour but i would like to have a do you have them yes now before we go to the records could you please kindly look at do you have a bundle plaintiff's bundle could you please turn to page nine is that mister baratham's report yes twenty fourth of september nineteen eighty five yes i have it in front of me you have that at the time when you were in the department of neuro surgery doctor baratham was the senior neurosurgeon and head of the department yes that is true now doctor baratham in this particular report states doctor balaji she sustained a head injury with a skull fracture and on x ray was found to have air inside her head this implied the possibility of infection and she was given prolonged course of antibiotics no definite effects result from her head injury but she was treated by the orthopaedic surgeon for various orthopaedic injuries please make reference to orthopaedic report now what would be your comment about the statement that there were no definite effects resulting from her head injury you have now doctor balaji you have now seen the records of this patient yes i would say i do not agree with that you do not agree with that yes for the following reasons if i may be allowed to give the reasons yes with that statement no definite effects result from her head injury yes for the following reasons one first with regard to the question of infection looking through the records you find that patient febrile for many days and sorry, patient yes when she was admitted in nineteen yes i didn't catch you what you said the patient had fever for many days while the patient was in hospital and when there is air in the head and the patient has a fever it must be assumed that most likely cause of the fever is an infection of the brain i also have the benefit of doctor ong's report and testing he just went by one of the functions of the frontal lobe which would be intellect which we can measure objectively using i q test the patient's i q test has dropped to below normal a normal i q being between eighty to one hundred and twenty range and what was the reading of the i q in the record i refer to page eighteen the second line the psychological assessment done showed her to be functioning at borderline range of intelligence i q sixty eight to seventy five no doctor balaji i think you are jumping the sequence we are still in eighty five this report at page eighteen is made in nineteen eighty seven yes so levels of intelligence do change you must agree so let's stick to ninety eighty five doctor baratham's report and you said that you did not agree with that statement for a variety of reasons and you were giving those reasons you see i disagreed with doctor baratham's statement in nineteen ninety in nineteen eighty five when doctor baratham was making his report i have no input into this matter so my decision or my statement or disagreement with him is based on information that is available to me in nineteen ninety whether i would have disagreed with him in nineteen eighty five when he wrote the report i don't know doctor balaji in nineteen eighty five if you had examined the first plaintiff would you have made the same statement as doctor baratham has made in his report no definite effects result from her head injury i don't know i would have to see the patient in order to give an opinion and not having seen the patient it's hard to say whether i would have given the same opinion or not doctor balaji doctor baratham clarified just now that at the time when he made his report on the twenty fourth of september nineteen eighty five he had not had the occasion to have a consultation with the patient but he made the report based on the hospital records i'm asking you that if you were in his shoes in nineteen eighty five no consultation with the first plaintiff purely based on the records would you have made that statement no why not because the patient stayed in hospital for a prolonged period of time patient was in hospital for at least a month there was air in the head which meant there was a fracture of the front part of the skull the patient had fever for many days and all this would have suggested to me a serious injury to the brain doctor balaji what do you understand by that statement that doctor baratham made no definite effects result from her head injury i would understand it to mean that he thought he could not be sure that the head injury caused all her problems can i ask you by reference to your records hospital records can you please tell his honour what were the complaints and condition of the first plaintiff at that time during the time of admission no we're talking about september eighty five well i'll take you through doctor balaji the patient was the first plaintiff was admitted on the eighteenth of april nineteen eight four she stayed in hospital for one month during that time that she stayed in hospital what were her persistent or common complaints when she came in she was confused she was not obeying any instructions this was at the time of the accident or at the time first day of admission two days after her admission her condition was still thought to be very poor about ten days after admission we have the first note that states that she is now conscious let his honour record want you are saying but the report doesn't state what level of mental activity there was but that's the first note of her being conscious so ten days after the admission she's conscious yes right and then it's about two months or rather one and a half months after admission you have the first note which states that she is now sounding a little rational irrational no sounding rational first note that she is not only conscious but she's now rational at least in the eyes of the doctor the medical officer who wrote that so the main complaint appears to have been fever and her mental functions please look at the report carefully are there any other complaints or condition that she suffered during that time from the date of admission to the time she was normal yes she has got thigh ulcers no i'm talking about from the neurological point of view from the neuro logic point of view no nothing else in the record no is there any reference to poor memory no is there any reference to incontinence no is there any reference to her inability to control her bowel no is there any reference to emotionally being emotionally labile no doctor balaji you said that only after ten days the record shows that she was in a conscious state yes right could you please look at page six of that bundle before you the plaintiff's bundle of documents which were given to you your honour page six of the p b you have that that's a report from doctor ong tze guan yes now in the first paragraph at the second sentence he says the above-named was admitted to the neuro logical unit on seventeenth october eighty four following a road traffic accident she was conscious but confused yes so does your record show that she was admitted in a conscious state or was she admitted in unconscious state the first neuro logic examination states it as follows confused but talking not obeying commands if i may just make but it must show that therefore she was conscious no if i might make a note about the word the interpretation of the word conscious consciousness from a neuro logic view in examining a person is a spectrum on one spectrum one end of it is the person who totally comatose without any kind of response and at the other extreme is a person who is totally normal in function and in between these there are gradations of consciousness and one of the important parameters we go by is whether the person can follow instructions if the person cannot follow instructions then a lot of those mental functions that you have asked about like memory emotional liability and all this cannot in any way be tested neither are they of any they're all impaired because that person is not in communication with his environment even though he is sort of awake in the sense that his eyes are open so that would be impaired consciousness but according to the hospital records she was not admitted in an unconscious state although she was not admitted in a comatose state but she was admitted so the person was confused is confused she's admitted confused unable to follow any instructions but not comatose not comatose and the reference to her becoming conscious on the tenth day after admission would you agree that that is the day when she can probably communicate with he environment understand instructions and so on yes that's probably when she began to follow some instructions now during the stage when a patient or person is not in a conscious state because she was not able to communicate with the environment would such a patient also have problems with incontinence and problems relating to controlling the bowel yes in the sense that they will not ask to go to the bathroom or things like that and so they have social incontinence the mechanism itself is working but they don't have the mental ability to take care of themselves
Singapore	mister yeoh can you tell the court the nature of your work experience i've been managing director of this company technikem laboratories services for fourteen years and we have been handling a lot of analyses a lot of laboratory investigations and testings since incorporation in nineteen seventy seven do you actually perform the laboratory tests yes i have a group of lab staff but for this particular instance i was the one that i handled the whole thing now tell us how much experience do you have in analysing paints and thinners we don't analyse very many samples in paint but thinners yes as a solvent we do quite a number of analyses on thinners is this the first occasion that you have been asked to analyse a paint no we did paint analysis before but not in this manner not in this manner but you have not analysed paints on many occasions is that correct yes it's not that many occasions now you have said that you have not been asked to analyse a paint in this manner i believe you are referring to the manner in a b forty four i mean in this investigative manner i was referring to this to carry out tests spray and this and that this is not we always analyse as a product so who suggested this method of testing for you it's between the discussion of myself and mister lee do you know whether mister lee is a chemistry expert no i don't know now why then being a professional chemist uh did you have to discuss the test method with mister lee of course mister lee is my principal in this instance i have to discuss with him about the manner or what which i mean it's a mutual it is a he's my principal so i have to discuss with him i just can't take a sample and do it myself in my own way without his approval because he's paying the bill now did mister lee ask you what did mister lee tell you the objective of the test in a b forty four which one you mean for these two reports yes we'll start with forty four first thirty four not thirty three forty four first forty four is the later one never mind okay yes i knew the background of the problem that he said the paint applied on the acrylic board then to get cobwebs and peel off and so on i knew the background of the you know the reason for doing the investigation could you tell us in full your understanding of the background to this problem tell us in detail as far as i understand from mister lee that he showed me a sign of the shell's logo and that there was paint that already painted on the surface shows signs of cracks and i think one or two and i think one or two position had peeled off now therefore can you tell us what is the objective of your report in a b forty four as what i mentioned earlier it's to simulate the way that they applied the paint on the material and see whether you have uh the same effect as what they have observed earlier in other words the objective of your test was to recreate the same result is that correct i don't say same result but just as an experiment to see whether to simulate the actual way of application and see whether we see what type of result to get that's all but your ultimate objective was to see whether the paint would crack yes now was it your objective in this test in a b forty four to find out the cause of cracking no in other words you would not be able to say anything about the cause of the cracks is that not in this particular report not the cause of the cracks but it's an observation that's all i refer you now to this a b forty four the details of it alright at introduction line three you said by applying various kansai coloured paints diluted with plat top thinner what coloured paints were these all sorts of colours white yellow red black four colours five colours well one two three four and you diluted these paints only with plat top number eleven i didn't dilute it was if you read the report it was diluted by the well by the workers when i was there that is stated in my report where does it say it said diluted with plat top thinners on clean acrylic boards with the help of mister lee ah yong of comsign and his technicians in other words these paints samples were diluted in front of me during my presence by comsign officers yes in your presence yes now mister yeoh are you able to comment whether the dilution by these officers of comsign is a proper one proper in what sense suitable for application well i put it again in my application the paint on the third paragraph the paint was then diluted with a thinner to a certain degree which by the opinion of mister lee was suitable for spraying in other words mister yeoh on the question of dilution you left it to the opinion of mister lee yes as to what was suitable uhm i think can i make a comment on that yes sure because i think they because they are using a sprayer so they are the one who knows best how dilute or how viscous the paint should be for their own sprayer yes but mister yeoh would you not agree that if a paint is excessively or under diluted it would have unsatisfactory effects on the outcome of the paint work can you just repeat it please if someone were to over dilute the paint would that not affect the result well i think if a paint is over diluted you will find that it would not be able to stick on as good as what it there is a certain percentage that you have to mix and you can't be too dilute because it would not stay it would crack i don't know whether it will crack or or it will peel off probably even when it dry off probably everything will be gone because if it's too dilute that means you i'm not too sure how i can put it to you but in my opinion is you have to have a certain degree of mixing before you can make the paint stays okay mister yeoh in other words there is a correct proportion of dilution of paints yes and if you were to over dilute the result would be unsatisfactory well it will be generally unsatisfactory and yet mister yeoh in this test on the question of the suitable dilution of paints you left it to mister lee or his workers yes i mean the reason i explained earlier that they supposed to know best that what is the concentration required for their sprayer because if you have too concentrated you may find problem to spray out if too dilute also you will be you know flying all over the place so i presume that they have been doing this job for years they should know what is the best that's why i put in in their opinion you know i asks you again mister yeoh do you agree that if you were to over dilute or under dilute a paint plastic paint it may cause cracking of the paint cracking or peeling i would not comment on that no but i would imagine that in fact in the first place if you no sorry sorry you are not able to comment or you will not comment on that i would not be able to comment but you agree that there is a suitable range of dilution yes may i add yes in my opinion the paint that appears here the painted surface in my opinion is reasonable in the sense that it's not a diluted over diluted type of paint that is to stick on this  chief justice: can you repeat that please  no in my opinion this particular for this particular sample these two samples i think it has been properly applied with suitable amount of paint there is not the over diluted paint that's what you like to put it to me just now because we can see the paint it is not a thin paint it is not a thin paint work i'll come back to that later mister yeoh when you say you conduct a test under experimental conditions should not you or your laboratory staff be conducting every aspect of the test no it's not necessary this is not the first instance that we carry out investigation in this manner it is not necessary that we have to do from a to z in fact we leave it to whoever who knows best to do it but of course to our own satisfaction next paragraph the acrylic boards used were fresh from stock what do you mean by that yes because it was taken out from a wrapping in my opinion it is fresh now what size and shape is this this is a for this particular one all this are original shape now did you examine the boards with the cracked paint which board which board you're talking about you're talking about this sample or you're talking no the boards that were painted by the plaintiffs you mean the signboard you're talking about yes yes i saw the signboard myself did you examine them yes are these the ones with the shell logo sorry are these the ones with the shell logo yes with the shell logo now are the cracks that appeared in your experiment of the same nature as the ones that were painted by plaintiffs similar the cracks look similar are you satisfied that the cracks in the experiment and on the boards painted by the plaintiffs were caused by the same cause i have no comment on what you have no comment no i have no comment on that and under observations second paragraph second line you said it could not be confirmed if the acrylic board had been affected as well as removal of paint by a solvent could tarnish the acrylic surface yes can you explain this what really we meant in this report was we saw the cracks okay this is on a applied surface and this is a unapplied surface and now you read the cracks from this end from the unapplied surface and you can see the cracks you can see the cracks if you like we have to like to show to the lord  chief justice: these are the cobweb-like cracks  yes yes that's how the so by these observations we could not confirm that whether the acrylic surface has whether these cracks only on the paint itself or whether it has eaten into the acrylic surface that is what i mean i could not confirm witness i next refer you to a b thirty three your other report now under item h you have stated plastic strips said to be made of acrylic plastic material why have you qualified the words in that manner well we did not confirm that whether this is acrylic or not it's said to be because it was given to us and said this is an acrylic board that's why we put down as said to be in other words you cannot confirm that this is an acrylic board well if we were to ask to confirm we could do another test to confirm whether this is acrylic material or not but at that instance we just because after all the board was given to us say this was the board that's been used for the actual paint work 
Singapore	your name is doctor baratham is that correct that's correct b a r a t h a m that's correct you are a neurosurgeon by profession that's correct, my lord can you tell the court some time in nineteen eighty-one which hospital were you attached i was attached to tan tock seng general hospital my lord perhaps you will tell the court for how long a period were you with tan tock seng i was with tan tock seng hospital neuro surgical department from the time the department was opened in nineteen seventy-three until until i left the government service in nineteen eighty-seven when did you first started practice i started practice as a doctor in nineteen sixty and started training in neuro surgery in nineteen sixty-five can you tell the court briefly what do a neurosurgeon treats what type of sickness or injuries we treat haemorrhages tumours and especially injuries affecting the brain do you know of another branch of doctor known as neurologist yes my lord i know what do a neurologist does they treat non-surgical conditions of the nervous system non-surgical non-surgical in other words they will not operate or treat head injury they will not be they will not treat head injuries no very well doctor can i show you three medical reports here written by you your honour may that be admitted and marked your honour his three medical reports on the bundle of page one two and three page two ya yhe three medical report all three marked as page three all three by the same doctor sir all of them page two all right may i refer you to the first report which is the one dated eighteen of may no sorry twenty-seventh of july nineteen eighty-one twenty-seventh of july nineteen eighty-one that is page two can you read the statement read your report to the court this patient was admitted on the twenty-seventh april nineteen eighty-one following a road traffic accident special x rays did not show hemorrhage inside the brain but he was thought to have suffered a bruising of the brain the medical term for that is contusion since then he has been followed up as an outpatient a final assessment can only be made after a year i see so you confirm doctor that you examined this patient and you found that there is a bruising on his brain is that correct that is correct my lord now how severe was this injury it was sufficient to cause changes on the c t scan which were of a temporary nature but not sufficient to cause bleeding inside the brain my lord now may i refer you to the second report which you made on the eighteenth of may eighty-two you mention here that he was found to have some problem of co-ordination now what type of problem would you classify that as i don't quite understand the question i mean what type of he had some problem of co-ordination how severe and what characteristic would these problems of co-ordination would be he would have difficulty in performing a number of sequential actions that is moving in an ordered sequence learnt movement my lord the technical word for this is dyspraxia d y s p r a x i a which means now in this report you also mentioned that the c t scan did not show any blood clot inside the skull now this was done in nineteen eighty-two no no eighty no the c t scan done on at the time of admission in april nineteen eighty-one eighty-one ya that is right i refer to that c t scan but is it possible that at the time of accident there is a contusion of the brain i mean there is a blood clot there was at the time of accident a contusion of the brain seen on the c t scan not a blood clot i want to distinguish between a contusion and a hemorrhage just to reconfirm that i got what you have said at the time of the accident you examined him and there was a contusion in the brain i examined the c t scan my lord ya that is right that showed the contusion correct that is all the patient had symptoms of a contusion how long will this contusion last i mean does it stay on forever the appearance my lord on the x-ray on the c t scan would be obvious for a week few weeks or few months just like a bruise it would disappear but the effects on the brain may last for a considerably longer period now i refer you to the last report which is sixth of september eighty-three in paragraph two you have reported that you have examined him on the seventh of august nineteen eighty-three and that he was found to have in-co-ordination of the right side of his body now can you tell the court more about what in-co-ordination that you found we test for in-co-ordination my lord in a very standard way we ask a person to touch your finger and touch his nose and move up and down or to do a series of concerted actions like imitating playing the piano or picking up objects and by observing him do this we can notice any problems with movement in your opinion doctor do you know whether such injury would be permanent the in-co-ordination it was present my lord for more than two years after the accident and i would therefore assume that it would permanent from this injury to his brain doctor would you say that there would be any side effect like for instance loss of memory headaches relapses he could have mental problems but by his own testimony my lord he did not complain of headaches and said he was otherwise normal this is on my examination in august eighty-three i see you also mentioned in the last paragraph that because of his impairment he will be unable to do his job as a welder is that correct that is correct my lord it's in my report i have no more further questions sir doctor baratham when he was first admitted to the hospital on the twenty-seventh of april nineteen eighty-one the x-ray showed a mere contusion is that not right or is that not right the brain scans show the contusion my lord i don't know about mere or it showed a bruising on the surface of the brain oh i see so and he was not hospitalised was he discharged immediately on the same day no i am certain my lord he was hospitalised for how long i do not have a record of that not available sir with your leave sir my apologies to the court i have not submitted the medical certificate may i sir sorry sir authorised by doctor baratham sir i am obliged sir sir may that be admitted since they've agreed yes i am obliged sir he was according to the medical cert he was discharged on the seventh of may nineteen eighty-one yes now what were your observations while he was warded doctor i mean was there any in co-ordination in this hand or what was he suffering from while he was warded or is it just a brain contusion my lord i do not recall what my observations were when he was warded because i would have been in charge of a very large number of cases and my own observations for each individual case would not have been made my lord i would have supervised his treatment rather than be in charge of his day-to-day treatment doctor your medical report is brief it merely states that he had a bruising of the brain and nothing else that is correct then on the next page that is i mean your second medical report on the eighteenth of may nineteen eighty-two that's at page two of the plaintiff's bundle of documents and your second medical report doctor you again merely refer to the original x ray taken on the twenty-seventh of april nineteen eighty-one so there was no further examination as such there was no further x ray examination my lord no correct and this report merely states that he was last seen as an outpatient on ninth september eighty-one when he had some problems of co-ordination he was not seen by you is that not doctor he was seen by some other doctor on that date as an outpatient yes he may not have been seen by me when i so you wouldn't be able to assist this court as to what his problems of co-ordination were on that date not on this date no my lord now on your third report doctor on your third report you say he was reassessed for the purpose of this report on seventeenth august eighty-three at that time he was found to have in-co-ordination of the right side of his body does this refer to your first paragraph which says this man was admitted to our unit on april nineteen eighty-one does this report refer to the earlier findings of in- co-ordination rather than on that date it refers to my own assessment of him in august eighty-three the in-co-ordination refers to the situation in august nineteen eighty-three my lord i alter that to at the time at the time the second sentence in paragraph two should read at the time it's at that time i think this is a typographical error or a dictation error or it should be at the time at the time of this report on the time of this examination on the seventeenth august nineteen eighty-three my lord i am sorry for the ambiguity this is the third report my lord see doctor baratham you seem to have in your report accepted this man's word rather than gone on your own observation because your paragraph there it says prior to this accident this man was a welder he was tested by the foreman of his firm and his co-ordination was found to be inadequate for a job of a welder this is what he seems to have told you this is not something you found out from the foreman of his firm my lord i was not in communication with the foreman of the firm he told me this he told you this but his in-co-ordination was something i tested for and observed myself i did not my lord feel competent to decide whether his in- co-ordination made it impossible for him to be a welder i thought that was better left to his foreman so you were not i couldn't tell this my lord i could tell his in-co-ordination i couldn't say whether he could do a job as a welder i am unfamiliar with welding so that is exactly the point doctor that you are unable to say whether he can work as a welder or not i am unable to say this it is impossible for me to decide that my lord next you say in your report that he only had a moderate head injury what do you mean by that that is correct my lord we classify head injuries into mild concussions moderate injuries where we have some clear cut evidence of permanent brain damage and severe head injuries when the brain damage and severe head injuries is such that the person can be totally incapacitated 
Singapore	doctor kong when you first saw the patient on the twentieth of august nineteen ninety-one in your clinic were you aware that the court had already declared her to be of unsound mind i'm not aware of that fact were you supplied with any medical reports prepared by doctor ong or woodbridge hospital at the time when you examined no at the time when i examined her i have been told that there was a doubt as to whether she was of sound mind and i then proceed to examine her how long was your first interview i believe it was about one and a half to two hours i think we set aside two hours i recall having some time left over so it must have been an hour and a half or slightly more than that with yourself yes i interviewed the plaintiff's husband not just the patient alone my clerk was in the room with me because i need a interpreter how long you took to interview the patient alone patient alone i would say for about first occasion roughly an hour i would say roughly an hour yes do you understand the malay language doctor a little and how long did you interview the patient during the second interview on the fourth of september nineteen ninety-one second interview if i recall correctly i think it's about forty-five minutes or so forty-five minutes yes about forty-five minutes and the dialogue was also in malay language yes i would put the question to my clerk she translate it and she would respond to her so you would not be able to say whether the patient's knowledge of the malay language is good or poor i passed my standard one malay for all that is worth i don't use it very often and so my facility with it was not that great but from the kind of words that my clerk was using to her i would think that her command of language was quite good better than me at least you knew that she came from india to singapore in nineteen seventy-six yes indeed and you were aware that this accident took place in nineteen eighty-four yes indeed in a matter of eight years the patient coming with only a knowledge of tamil language is able to speak good malay would it not reflect that prior to the accident her i q must have been above average i think to learn a language and master a language one need not be above average otherwise a lot of people would not be able to speak i think it would be safe to say that to master a language sufficiently an i q even a borderline i q should be able to pick up the necessary language you see that's the basis of the kind of training that are given to educationally subnormal they can learn languages and use it with facility you see that's the basis so it does not mean that just because she can master a language she must therefore be above average then we are ruling out all the e s n's from learning any language isn't it but the fact that she could pick up a new language in a new environment would show that she had good intelligence i wouldn't say good intelligence sufficient intelligence to learn a new language you did not ward her in any hospital to observe her no i did not and your report is based on these two short interviews you had with her based on it interviews plus the assessment assessment reports that we had made did she understand what this examination was all about this was put to her at the second session and as i said she did not say whether she understood or don't understand so i'm not able to ascertain that point exactly your honour now in your first interview you found her answers were vague and unspontaneous and at times appeared inconsistent what impression did you gather at that moment during your first interview well i leave an open mind there are many possibilities and in my trade the fact that the person has this trait could mean many things there are many causes as you know for a person being vague and so forth and of course as results keep coming in then one becomes slowly certain why she was vague etceteras did you observe doctor that if you asked a leading question she would easily answer yes no no for example if you ask her are you living at telok blangah the answer would be yes no not true how was your questions put to her some of the questions we get her to describe some were leading questions but i would think that the proportion would be fifty-fifty in fact in psychiatric examination we are instructed that we do not ask leading questions as much as we can yes and the other questions direct questions requiring a yes or no and in some instances she didn't exactly give yes in fact sometimes she give no at the second interview do you watch t v she says no did you notice any difficulty in her shifting from one topic to another no difficulty in fact i do it very often in my interview it's a technique i have developed to pick up certain things and i move from one to the other and i noticed that she was able to respond you look at page one of your report doctor at the bottom she was complaining to you about her body pains and despite that she was not able to point out exactly where the headache was how do you explain that i can't explain that i put it as a statement of fact that she can't you see she was describing her symptoms and all that so when she stopped i said well but where's the headache and then she she didn't respond so i don't know what to make out of that it can be due to so many reasons isn't it a normal person doctor if he complains about stomach pain or headache will tend to put the hand at the abdomen or in the forehead but not so in this case not so in that yes the question is why did it not strike that something was abnormal on her well something is abnormal but the question then your honour is why would the person not respond you see if you want to take the whole range you can say this is due to brain damage you can take the other extreme end and you can say that this is malingering this is hysterical it's a whole range you see so i refuse to commit myself i put it as a statement of fact you are aware that she had an injury to her frontal lobe indeed this was what she said as well or her husband said to the no i'm talking about the patient forget about the husband for the time being because your interview is restricted to the patient did she complain to you anything else apart from the bodily pains what did she complain of she complained of headaches her head bursting giddiness a lot of symptoms in relation to the head and did you conduct any test for her memory yes my psychologist did the graham kendall's memory for design test which showed eleven which is borderline up to about twenty-five is considered borderline i think roundabout seven is considered borderline so she i would say she get quite a high score the lower the score the normal it is the higher the score the more abnormal it is so we didn't arrange a borderline from say seven to about twenty-four she score about eleven which i think is quite good obviously she has definite memory deficits but her memory deficits strike me on the testing as mild it's considered borderline but she had some difficulty performing the task she was slow yes she was slow which my psychologist document you can read that in his report now did you find out what was her attitude towards her children i did ask her about her children and she says she's quite happy with the children and she said that they were good to her so i put her a direct question so are you therefore happy with them she just kind of again stared blankly no answer no answer so she doesn't answer yes to direct questions that's one and two her response again would indicate a wide variety of conditions so i feel that it's i would put it down as a matter of fact rather than comment on it did you also observe that in one moment she would say something and the next moment she'll forget not all the time but were there instances of such there were perhaps one or two instances when she would behave like that again the significance of this behaviour like with this is open to question it can be argued for example doctor you said that you were asking about the children and finally you put a question to her and the answer is negative yes how would you explain to that condition well as i said there are many different explanations from that it can be due to depression it can be due to brain damage can be due to malingering or hysteria whatever one can put to it you see there's a whole range of explanations for instance when i asked her how many legs a dog has and she don't respond for a minute i thought that she won't say anything so i was very pleasantly surprised when she says four i'm glad i waited had i been impatient i would have lost that so i'm not sure whether in fact you know one can say it's due to brain damage i mean the causes of such responses such behavioural responses are many and at this point in time i want just to describe what actually happened and state it there did you discuss with her about what plan she has for her family her sons we tried to but she doesn't want to consider that there was no response well she showed by her demeanour that she doesn't want to respond to it in such circumstances doctor do you think that she would be able to live independently i think again it's very hard to say why would a person not be interested to discuss the future i think again one can think of a variety of causes that can cause a person to act and behave in that way and i do not want to straitjacket myself and say it is due to this one thing or put it down first and let's consider what other possible causes do you think that she'll be able to lead an independent life i think so because in my view i am increasingly convinced looking at doctor ong's report that a lot of it all could be due to phobic anxiety and a large degree i think to a depression that probably i hesitate to say this but i think it's probably inadequately treated suppose you give her a ten dollar note doctor and ask her to go down to the market just below her apartment and do the daily marketing for the day do you think she'll be able to carry out that function well doctor ong says that she could handle small amount of money in one of his earlier reports if that's the case i would expect that if we can overcome the phobia and get her out of the home on the basis of what doctor ong said i would say yes but at this moment do you think she would be able to  at this moment a lot of motives will contaminate the behaviour isn't it motives of tranquil my question is at this moment do you think she would be able to carry out the function of a housewife like going to the market 
Singapore	you are sergeant three zero two saw eng hock yes my lord saw eng hock yes my lord you are attached to the traffic accidents investigation section uhm all right where are you attached now i

for eye witnesses yes my lord no one responded eye witnesses mean independent eye witnesses no one responded no further questions my lord sergeant can we refer to a b five the sketch plan you've drawn on the sketch plan the scratch mark at f one e one can you tell us what caused the scratch mark on the road it may be caused by the scratching the body of the pick-up can you tell us where does the scratch mark lead to which part of the pick-up does the scratch mark lead to it lead to the pick-up the vehicle the are you able to say which part of the pick-up the roof the roof of the pick-up well

the part of the pick-up is it behind the cabin the driver's cabin i cannot recall okay you said earlier that no evidence that there were any that the pick-up hit the curb but sergeant you only arrived at the scene about one hour after the accident and yes my lord and the sketch plan reflects the position of the vehicle after the accident yes my lord so am i correct to say that you will not be able to tell us what happened how the accident took place yes my lord so can i say that it is also likely that the pickup may have collided with the curb the divider the centre divider yes my lord from your investigations did any of the passengers that were seated behind the pick-up tell you whether they were able to say what happened what caused the accident they were unable to tell my lord they were unable to tell was the passenger in front seated in front able to give you an account of what happened yes my lord you inspected the pick-up after the accident are you able to say that from the damage to the pickup it is consistent with to the front of the pick-up it is consistent with it colliding into something into a divider for example from the damage caused to the pick-up i'm unable to tell you my lord i'm unable to tell my lord unable to tell could you have a look at the damage report at page a b six in particular could you look at the damage to the front right portion of the pick-up the front right signal light broken right front fender slightly dented right passenger's door windscreen glass broken from the damage to the right side of the vehicle would you say that it's consistent with it colliding into the divider the centre divider i was unable to tell my lord okay one more question now if i may just bring you back to the scratch marks you see that it leads to the pick-up am i correct to say it only leads to the right to the right portion of the pick-up it ends there the right side of the pick-up the left side sorry the left side of the pick-up my apologies i cannot confirm my lord sorry i was trying to ascertain from him whether the scratch marks which part of the pick-up he said it led to the pick-up but in particular which part of the pick was it only to the right it ends at the right side of the pick-up which is overturned on the plan sorry on the left side of the pick-up which is overturned it ends i just want to ascertain from him whether it ends there if i may be of assistance to the court your honour i have the photographer with the photographs that shows more clearly with the position of the vehicle if it can be shown to the sergeant because this happened many years ago may i ask the photographer to come in and release the photographs my lord hussein mohammed hussein p c seven eight three two subject to his lordship's permission would we be able to produce the photographs to this witness yes may he be permitted to wait inside my lord if my learned friend has no objection subject to your lordship's overturned yes there are other pictures which are more clearer my lord sergeant now that you've had a look at the photographs can you tell us whether the scratch mark ends on the left side of the vehicle my lord the scratch part that is leading to the pick-up i am not sure whether it's left or right side well sergeant can you look at the sketch plan again you have drawn the sketch mark as it appears to end on the left side of the pick-up there are two scratch mark there one lead to the more or less the centre of the centre part and the other one on the left side could you tell us which one leads to where this one leads to the centre which one this one centre c f no which one are you pointing to my lord based on the photograph and the sketch plan that i draw i cannot recall anything sorry what's your answer are you saying that one of them you are saying that one of them leads to the one the scratch mark leading to the left and one to the centre from the photographs from the photographs yes my lord from your investigations can you tell us with reference to the sketch plan at which part of the road did the pick-up overturned the pick-up was lying on the centre lane my lord no actually what i wanted was sergeant can you indicate perhaps on the sketch plan where the pick-up started where did it start to overturn i am not able to tell my lord yes i will sir okay finally you inspected the pick-up after the accident yes my lord was it in road worthy condition actually i am referring to the inspection of the because normally after the accident they inspect the vehicle to see if there is any defect blatant defect or anything that would whether the vehicle was in fact road worthy before the accident i believe they have a report i am not too sure he would be it is the subsequent inspection that i am referring to yes i believe he has a report no no my lord okay were any defects were you informed of any defects to the pick-up there is no defect my lord i don't know whether my learned friend will agree unless my learned friend objects to the admission of that document perhaps we could have it of the inspection report we could have it admitted and save the calling of the witness i have no objection your honour sorry i think may be he has a copy could you show your honour the copy of the inspection report of the whatever report you have we will make copies of it afterwards your honour

from jurong police station yes my lord was there any damage to the tyres of the vehicle to indicate that it mounted the road divider or the curb before hitting the tree no my lord was there any scratch mark or any damaged sign to the road curb around the vicinity no my lord i have only one last question i will leave it to your lordship to decide it if i am allowed to ask i will ask because he may not be an expert i will ask him if your lordship would allow me you have investigated many of these accidents yes my lord and if a vehicle travel at about forty kilometres even if there was some swerving action if he did turn right would he end up in that position with an overturned vehicle shown in the photographs i am unable to tell my lord 
Singapore	witness you mentioned one employee by the name of ernest do you know his full name i think it is ernest d'souza he's a eurasian ernest d' souza yes what was his occupation in nineteen eighty five at around the time when the plaintiff met the accident what was his designation production assistant you were then the production supervisor yes at the time of the accident what was the nature of the relationship between you and ernest i mean i am not talking about your private relationship what i mean is as employer in your employment what was who is answerable to whom and how was the relationship like at that time in eighty four eighty five uh we still got a problem of recruitment at that time slowly please let his honour take down yes you had problem of recruitment yes and the person on top of me is a japanese he's a production manager mister naiya so after that uh there is a vacancy for assistant manager but it's not filled up and there's a vacancy for senior supervisor it's not filled up and the next one is supervisor i am the supervisor at that time and below me there should be group leaders for every section there are five or six sections under me if everything is smoothly each individual group uh will have a group leader but sometimes we have the people there but we don't got the people of calibre so it's uh not filled up and after this group leader there's a the step lower so in eighty five there was no group leader there's no group leader in fact further down is assistant group leader we also don't have assistant group leader what was the nature of the work of this group leader no no it is basically the same and after this group leader is production assistant production assistant was this ernest as you were saying yes yes so and below that below that it will be workers so my policy at that time is if you my policy at that time is it is not uh my policy in fact it is the company policy if you come in without any primary education you join as a worker if you got o level you join in as p a so from there we assess you and we try to promote you and i would like to tell you that ernest was one of the more bright one even if if he never resign today maybe he might be assistant supervisor and in fact he never resigned in fact i sacked him because of he absent for two weeks correct that is besides the point now what i'm asking you is ernest placed in charge of one section alone or what is the relationship to you the relationship vis-a-vis you and ernest in the job in this colour section yes everything he have to report to me because at that time i was training him to be the assistant group leader so normally in the production side where these plates are being removed there would have been a ring leader as you call it or leader group leader as you call it supervising this assistant supervisor or whoever you said is it is there one position for group leader normally what would be who would be supervising this group leader this assistant production myself is the supervisor i see and if there is a group leader what duty is his basically what he do is he will do the same thing like the production assistant only the title only meaning the title example let's say ernest is the group leader and if i take another newcomer he got o level so he is also a production assistant so the only thing is the seniority problem at that time how many assistant supervisors did the company have there is no assistant supervisor no no in the position as ernest ernest was assistant he was a p a production assistant production assistant how many of such persons were employed he is the only one he is the only one yes and plus the q c q c there is two for q c q c two production assistant for q c that is a different section ya but it is under me ya so in this section of colour matching where these moulds these plates are being taken was this ernest the only person who was in charge of both these machines yes and where were you stationed normally what was does your duty require you to be around this machine as it's functioning or not necessary because my office is on the second floor it's on the second floor and this machine is in the production floor so i have to walk quite a distance and the nature of the work is that every morning every morning he is briefed what he have to do what i want him to do ernest's been briefed yah he's being briefed so he have to do what he's told and ernest gets the workers to do the work is it basically he do it himself at that time he was alone i think and you see the plaintiff says at the time of the accident he was already into the job of removing plates yes this was done with your knowledge wasn't it yes you knew that he was doing that job yes but i transfer him out in august somewhere in august august nineteen eighty five nineteen eighty five out from where from q c no no i'm now referring to the section to the time he was already in the colour matching section now witness so who then if he has any complaints or anything who does he refer to ernest either one he can refer to ernest he can refer to me and normally who gives the orders to the plaintiff because he's quite new in the section so normally i go through ernest you go through ernest yes yes because if i go through him i am bypassing ernest and in between this production of this colour plates would ernest be required to show the sample as and when they produce times the sample of the plate to you to confirm whether they can proceed with the production yes and on the day of the accident the plaintiff says that it was while ernest was going upstairs to the office to show either you or somebody else i'm not sure the plate that he was told to carry on and he did so could you remember ernest coming to you with the plate well anyway i don't see him you didn't see him yes you didn't see ernest at that time i believe it is only a few minutes difference the time of accident is two o'clock so normally my lunch break is twelve forty to one twenty at one twenty the siren will go on and during this lunch break most of the worker will be sleeping or resting so i don't see them starting to work at about one forty five because they will take their time to wash their face go to the loo you know so on that day of the incident you don't remember ernest coming to see you with the plate no no and at the time of the accident now the plaintiff says the accident was at one forty five and this was not disputed you were not at the scene of the accident no now witness since you know much about this machine can you confirm that the machine as it works in the normal sense when the gate guard remains open the mould the moving mould should remain stationary yes and do you agree with me also if at all the moving mould has moved there must be something faulty about the machine i don't think when the gate is open the mould can move not to my knowledge so from your opinion in normal conditions the mould should not move yes now witness what is the function of the two switches one at the rear and one in the front what is the function of the switches we call it a something like a relay switch so the function is to cut off the front one if the gate get contact with the front one that means the circuit is on so if you finish your process you open the door and the back touch the switch on the back the circuit should be cut off correct so as one opens the guard gate it should establish contact with the rear switch and then the circuit should be cut off and the mould should be stationary yes now witness you said that after the accident people like ernest refused to touch the machine ernest in your own words was an experienced worker yes how long has he been working with that company before that maybe two years did you not tell him why is he refusing to work because the reason i of course everybody feel very upset about the accident and i wouldn't want to you know to question him why he don't want to use it might be due to you know all the skin and the flesh are stick on the mould you have to consider that when the hand was crushed all the skin and some of the bones got stuck on the mould and nobody want to clean it witness please you see your evidence before the court was that nobody wanted to work on that machine and then to relay their fear or something like that you had to call this engineer from this miki company now what i'm asking you is this but i never asked him what fear he had i see you didn't ask him yes so as a supervisor i presume that my assessment is that maybe because of the bones and the skin got stuck there no no we're not asking for your presumption we're asking you what you know now witness the inspector from the ministry of labour mister lawrence chew who gave evidence earlier said that he was told by mister tan boon keng this mister tan boon keng was he the assistant production manager then at that time yes and you were he was higher in office than yourself he's more superior than me he was more superior than you and he was the officer who was present at the time the officers from the ministry of labour came to inspect the machine yes because at that time i was not available witness you said later on the engineer recommended that two more switches not two one one switch one more switch be put on the miki machine yes on the front side on the front side did you all put that switch yes when was this switch installed a few months later few months later yes was it recommended for safety reasons to ensure that the guard doesn't close no the guard will close so why this japanese engineer recommend i'm not very sure why he recommend the additional switch on the front side you are not sure why i'm not sure this mister tan boon keng where is he now is he employed with the company no he already left two years ago sorry three years ago do you know where he is now he is in singapore you know his whereabouts roughly yes you know where do you think he's residing somewhere near my place somewhere near your place that would be that would be what address you know maybe i don't know the address but somewhere in bukit batok but you know his address you would be able to get that no no i call him you know his telephone number yes what is his telephone number sorry 
Singapore	your name is grace sng s n g that is right and you live at twenty-five siglap drive singapore you live at twenty five siglap drive singapore one five four five that is correct you are now the manager of information systems department in s i s i r right i think perhaps it would be more approved really if you say yes or no instead of uh if you don't mind right uhm in nineteen eighty you held the position of senior officer in s i s i r in charge of computer unit yes and as such you were involved in all aspects of computerization of business systems in s i s i r yes what did this involve could you kindly tell us in your own words miss sng i was evaluation and so on yes i was actually in charge in all aspects of the department this included evaluation and recommendation for purchase of hardware just just a moment his lordship is taking it down this involved the evaluation and recommendation for the purchase of hardware purchase of hardware yes and and also for appointment of the contractor for software development and the for the appointment of contractors for the development of software is that correct yes in may ninety eighty did s i s i r place an order for computer hardware yes what was the hardware digital digital p d p eleven system digital p d p eleven system that's right from automated can you elaborate on that with automatic with automated systems private you placed the order with automated systems private limited yes systems private limited and that company belonged to which group the computer systems advisors group what intention did s i s i r have to develop the application of software to run the p d p yes we had seven applications to develop and how did you come to know mister shaw hui jeong automated systems the company that sold us the hardware recommended mister shaw to us because he had experience in developing software for the p d p platform software for that type of computers yes so in view of the recommendation and mister shaw's experience in software development you say the pdp p d p what did s i s i r do we invited him to submit a quotation we invited him to submit a quotation for development of the software we had in mind there seven applications and the quotation you required was also for apart from development also for design and implementation that's all the activities involved in development all the functions right that's the scope of the project the systems were for how many applications what you said seven applications yes i am afraid it is not in the agreed bundle my lord i have got a quotation sixth of june nineteen eighty sixth of june nineteen was this is this a copy of the quotations yes page and the quotation was accepted and you wrote to mister shaw on the twelfth of july nineteen eighty is that a copy of the letter of acceptance we are pleased to inform you that our finance committee has accepted your preliminary quotation for the development and implementation of the t i s and accounting systems on our p d p one one three four as per your letter dated sixth june eighty yes that's correct now that project with s i s i r's finance company approved would you describe that as a major project yes it took ultimately about two years to complete it took two years to complete yes ultimately sorry two years to complete two years to complete yes and it involved according to that letter a computerisation of technical information service that's t i s is it t i s yes computerisation of t i s and how many accounting applications six applications six accounting applications and what was the cost of that system fifty eight thousand sorry fifty eight thousand fifty eight thousand and what did datatronics agree to provide they were supposed to provide a systems designer and a programmer and s i s i r systems designer and programmer can you remember the different aspects which the project covered yes you have to start it off with a systems study and then this investigation investigation followed by the systems specifying specifying the system and the design of the system then you went on to the actual programming testing and integration of all the sorry testing and design designing programming testing and integration file conversion from existing systems from existing manual system and writing the user documentation and the system documentation including manuals yes manuals user manuals manuals and documentation and documentation training of the users and also monitoring the first three months of live operations live live l i v e does it include parallel run of the existing systems parallel run yes parallel run that's all included in yes all included in the project yes manual and the yes together to make sure that everything is okay that the outputs you know tally with what you have manual records now throughout the whole project whom did you deal with in datatronics mister shaw who was in charge of that project he was the project manager he was the project manager mm and also the systems designer systems designer right and all discussions and negotiations for the purchase of the system were with whom in datatronics with mister shaw with mr shaw yes all discussions negotiations with him alone yes how often did he attend the office of s i s i r when we first started off the project when we were doing specification and design and a lot of the technical work initially it was almost every day then as the project progressed and it was more programming you know and programming and testing then he comes in when we have technical problems that need solving i see and also to oversee you know oversee as a project manager to oversee it so he came in maybe two or three times a week two or three times a week yes when he attended your office what were the office hours or what were the hours he kept nine to five but if there are problems and we had to solve them then we would stay on till nine or ten until you know nine or ten at night until we get the problem solved or we are too tired i see can you remember roughly what his responsibilities were his functions yes mainly he was the project manager the systems designer he would you know oversee all the programming testing and integration he wrote the first drafts of all the functional specifications first drafts of all the functional specifications yes then later on as you know as the specifications developed then he vetted you know all the enhancements of the specifications and he also came in to solve technical problems related to you know all these aspects programming and testing now miss sng and i'm sorry i beg your pardon i think initial training of the users and he was also involved in that training of users of the system training of users of the computerized system yes now you knew that mister shaw left datatronics in may eighty two eighty two yes what was the state of the what was the progress then we had one more application you know to develop one more application one more application to develop to develop the last one it was yes job costing yes did datatronics after he left did datatronics complete no we did not have anyone to replace him as a system designer and project manager and the assigned programmer was also away from the job did not show up five and project manager to replace mister shaw and the assigned programmer was away from the job i think the last five out of the last six weeks so at that point and time we decided to terminate you know the contract you terminated the contract yes and because it was not satisfactorily completed ten thousand i think was withheld as penalty for non-completion ten thousand ten thousand so you are saying that datatronics failed to assign a proper replacement for mister shaw replacement for mister shaw and after he left datatronics did s i s i r have any further business with mister shaw yes he when i had problems i still you know contacted him and he advised us on an informal basis then when he started his own company we contracted with him to do further enhancements on the applications further enhancements on on the applications on the applications yes the seven applications that was computerised applications yes that was nineteen eighty three to eighty five period yes and are those computerised applications still in operation today yes no further questions my lord now miss sng you said that you knew the plaintiff as mister shaw as the project manager and system designer did you know whether he was a director or partner or employee of the company datatronics we considered him as you know in charge of the whole company because he was the person we dealt with i didn't quite get the last bit we considered him as the person in charge of of datatronics i'm sorry because oh thank you my lord so he could have been the owner of the company he could have been the owner of the company as far as they were concerned yes my lord when you appointed datatronics first yes i will assume he was he did not specify his designation in any letters but we did not know okay when you appointed datatronics did you call for various quotations first yes did datatronics give the best price yes was there a vast difference between the datatronics' quotation and the other quotations not a big difference the only company that we invited to provide a quotation was c s a computer systems advisers but the difference was still enough for you to appoint datatronics yes my lord much obliged yes my lord not as much as that but that they had to be competitive initially so that very little profits were made when they gave quotations when mister shaw had left the company in nineteen eighty-two you only consulted him informally yes and did not appoint his company until nineteen eighty-three that was a different project but for nineteen eighty-two there was no formal contact between you and his company formal contact as in appointment no and you were the one who approached him he did not approach you as far as the project was concerned it was not completed so i think he has an interest in you know the project so we were in communication quite a lot as far as technical problems and as far as technical problems were concerned when we were faced with a technical problem then i would call him up you see tell me what to do next that kind of thing 
Singapore	doctor pua who brought the patient bachu miah to you the police officers how many police officers i do not remember you spoke with the police officers yes and what was your conversation with the police officers well the conversation with the police officers yes what did the police officers tell you they just brought the patients to us for examination before interrogation it is a pre statement examination did the officers discuss with you the injuries before you examined the patient no in what language did you speak to the patient mohamed bachu miah in what language did you speak to him i don't remember but i assume it to be english because i do not speak bangladeshi you don't speak bangladeshi did you record on your treatment card what language you spoke to the accused no i don't what questions did you ask the patient i don't exactly remember the conversation but the usual consultation we have with our patients is to ask them what injuries they have how did they sustain those injuries and whether they have any other problems medical problems but i don't remember the exact conversation i had with the patients now did you have any problems in communicating with the patient he is a bangladeshi you don't speak bangladeshi did you have any problems communicating with the patient i don't recall again whether i had any problems but i did manage to get the history now when you were examining the patient who else was in the examination room other than yourself and the patient my nurse my nurse anybody else i don't recall what about the police officer or police officers who brought the patient to you were they also in the room i don't remember please refer to your notes you may have something there we don't write whether the police officers are present during the examination of the injuries not in our notes what about the presence of the nurse is it written in the notes no that is the normal routine all consultation room has a nurse who will help us to fill in forms and how did you do your examination of the patient he came with his clothes on how did you do this examination well we examined them from head to toe complete examination and pay particular attention to injuries that they pointed it out to us during the history are you saying that he was asked to take off his clothes you examined his body his naked body yes doctor i am instructed and i put it to you that the patient never spoke to you because he could not speak english do you understand the question no i don't recall whether he spoke english or in any other language he might have some knowledge of may be malay or a little bit of english i don't remember but usually for any other patients if i can't communicate it's through if they can speak in malay then we get a nurse who can speak malay to translate or through sign language yes witness please confine your answer to this case i don't remember you don't remember whether you could communicate with him i don't remember you did not get any interpreters to communicate with the patient in this case interpreter from any person to interpret to you so that you could communicate with the patient if as you say they only speak bangladeshi then no because i don't think any nurses in the department can speak bangladeshi all right doctor can you look at your medical report paragraph two a healing linear abrasions over right cheek and left cheek both consistent with the history given can you please tell the court how old in your opinion were these injuries how old were the injuries yes it should be about a week at least a week old witness if i suggest to you that these injuries were inflicted on twenty-second january nineteen eighty-eight between three a m to five a m would you agree with that this would be eight days about eight days before you examined the patient it is possible and would you confirm in this court that these injuries two a were consistent with having been caused by scratching on the patient's face with the fingernails of another person yes doctor what about the injuries listed as two b in your report abrasions over the epigastric region of the abdomen and left forearm consistent with blunt injuries yes you told this court they were consistent with injuries sustained by climbing coconut trees now would you agree with me these injuries in the region of the abdomen would be consistent with fisting on the patient's abdomen by a person no these are superficial abrasions on the skin injuries that you would sustain when you scrape your skin against a rough surface and not a fist doctor i am referring to two b abrasions over the epigastric region right yes now did you pay attention to the appearance of this patient when he was brought to you how did he appear to you in other words what was his state your honour i am trying to ask the doctor whether she observed this patient was he looking normal or was he excited he was brought to you and what was your observation of this patient when he was brought to you i don't recall very clearly but i don't remember he was agitated you don't recall but you don't remember can you see your treatment card is there any note made of this observation that he was agitated or not whatever your observations were his general condition was good doctor did you take his blood pressure blood pressure yes it was one hundred and nine over sixty-three millimetres mercury one hundred and nine over sixty-three is that normal yes and what was his pulse rate like did you take it fifty-three per minute and would you describe that as normal yes doctor the average pulse rate is around seventy seventy two isn't it that is just an average heart rate but it is a wide range from fifty to about one hundred depending on your emotional state on your physical fitness for somebody who has been doing manual work i would assume his physical status to be pretty healthy and fit sportsmen have been known to have pulse rate of thirty to forty beats per minute so fifty three beats per minute to me is normal i have no further questions sir i have watched the cross-examination of my learned friend and to the extent of the dialogue they had as to the difficulties in communication i would wish to adopt that part of it i would just like to put in a few more questions of my own doctor pua my clients says he doesn't speak english he has difficulty in communicating in english does he speak not even a word of english yes doctor pua looking at this report i would put it to you that you did not obtain history from my client what do you mean on the record that you have in page forty six can you have a look at page twenty sorry you are looking at a different report yes that is the one who is my client yes now you examined him on the first of february eighty eight at eleven fifty seven hours you put down there he claimed that his right index and middle fingers were bitten by the deceased on twenty first february eighty eight where did i get the history that his right index and middle fingers that's right it's from him so whatever barriers you may have had in communication you managed to overcome and come to this conclusion yes i can't remember how i got the history including that of the road traffic accident doctor pua you mentioned here that the fingers were bitten by the deceased how did you know that the deceased was involved the patient came with an accompanied form where he had to fill in and there is a short little history there can you come to that please can you read out that short little history read out the whole thing on the thirty first of january nineteen eighty-eight at about nine p m subject was arrested at number twenty-six mandai lake road for an offence of murder which was committed on the twenty second of january nineteen eighty eight at jalan kampong chantek please examine subject for old scars injuries and also any fresh injuries as he is about to give a statement to the police under the provisions of section one hundred and twenty two point six c p c he claimed that his fingers were bitten by the deceased and also had a fall in injuring his knees so in fact you were given a preview preliminary instructions brief details yes and basically this was what you have there just this section yes doctor pua phua you were in the company of a person who was apparently a murderer and you were only with a nurse a lady nurse you were conducting an examination on a person who was suspected of being a murderer and you were only in the company of a lady nurse i only remember that there was a nurse because that is routine i don't remember whether there were other people in the room whether it was a lady nurse oh i can't remember whether the nurse was a lady or a male so sorry it was a presumption on my part when i heard the word nurse i presumed a lady in the examination that you made if understand you correctly when you do the examination you examine your patient from head to toe and he is naked correct would the exact procedure be adopted in my client's case yes coming to the injuries marked as two a and two b these were consistent with being bitten about eight or ten days prior to your examination yes and the injury two f these are consistent with a traffic accident in bangladesh in nineteen seventy-six yes that would put them about twelve years old because you examined him in nineteen eighty-eight yes doctor pua did you also observe whether your patient had any mobility in his right arm anything in your card or observation notes yes i did note that his right deltoid muscle this muscle over here is wasted it is wasted yes so there would be an absence of some strength in that arm there would be some absence yes is dexterity also affected not fully because are you talking about like swinging for example like going bowling or climbing coconut trees or anything else yes yes it would be partially affected doctor i would like to take you now to the report where you have put up on bachu miah you have mentioned under two the following injuries were noted a healing linear abrasions over right cheek and left cheek doctor pua from your experience as a medical practitioner a scar i mean if it is a superficial scar how long would it take to heal about a week or so were these scars deep no consistent with a fight yes thank you doctor 
Singapore	doctor ang you said you prepared the preliminary report sometime after you had seen the accused yes my lords you have a copy of the report with you yes it is dated third of september eighty-seven is it have you made extra copies no i have extra copies my lords these were given to us at the commencement of the trial preliminary report one hundred and twenty-six my lords doctor this report was made on the third of september nineteen eighty-six is that right nineteen eighty-seven i am sorry nineteen eighty-seven yes now doctor i would like you to explain the differences between your initial report p one hundred and twenty-six and the final report that you tendered p one hundred and eighteen could you point out the differences to me i think the only difference the sense of it the only difference was in my first report i commented that he is fit to stand trial that he does not suffer from any mental disorder and fit to stand trial and at the time of the alleged offence he was not of unsound mind that was the conclusion of my first report because he was going for trial and that was meant for the first trial for the preliminary inquiry now in this at that point in time i made no mention of him not suffering from any abnormality of mind because normally i think abnormality of mind is a decision to be made usually by the court it is not for the psychiatrist to make it out but for this high court trial this seems to be the issue and so i specifically touched on it so the difference between these two is one i commented fitness to stand trial and not touching not mentioning abnormality of mind that part of it and on this one i did not mention to stand trial i just talked about no mental illness and not of unsound mind and no abnormality of mind arising from those conditions so i think in this sense that is the difference the other things the minor things about family history i think there are some because of course in this trial i have heard more things and i have incorporated more things they are for two different purposes in fact even when i prepared the first report if it is going to be a high court trial another report will be submitted doctor in your initial report you did not consider the issue as to whether there was any abnormality of mind of subject the accused i did not mention it in the report neither did you consider it that's my point i considered it but i did not include it in the report as i said the question of abnormality of mind and diminished responsibility is something to be raised not by the psychiatrist it is a decision to be made by the court doctor if you will just confine your answer to my question i think we can move along quite fast my question is did you consider it at the time when you prepared the initial report doctor did you consider the issue of abnormality of mind of course i had considered but it was not relevant to my report and i did not include it in my report just say you did yes i did i did in your final report did you also consider the issue of abnormality of mind my final report yes of course you considered it this time and you specifically mentioned that there was no abnormality of mind yes arising from those conditions arising from the rest of the developments and so on one essential difference between your initial report and your final report was that when you prepared the final report p one hundred and eighteen you had by then the evidence adduced at the trial yes my lords and you specifically mentioned it in paragraph b of p one hundred and eighteen yes my lords now doctor ang at that time when you prepared the preliminary report on what basis did you consider whether or not there was any abnormality of mind on the basis of the history that he gave me on the basis of the observations of his behaviour his narration of events of what happened from the moment of his own description of the events until the moment when he tried to shoot himself so i think based on all that in other words on no occasion at no time was there evidence that he was abnormal arising from all those conditions i think that was based on my examination of him on what basis on my examination of him and that's my conclusion and what he told you was reflected in the clinical notes that you recorded yes the sequence of events and the which at no time mentioned anything about the delusion or the possible delusion that he was a hero in the shanghai bank yes there was no mention of it because i know just yes or no and then we can go on no no doctor ang when you prepared the final report twenty-eight of february by then it had transpired in this court that there was evidence of the accused's claim to this delusion when he was the hero in shanghai bank yes by then you would have heard the evidence transpiring in court for a number of days already of what of the delusion yes that's what he claimed yes but you have heard in court correct this evidence which had been going on for a number of days already i heard this being brought up but then there is the other evidence from all the other people we will come to that doctor but just answer my question okay i heard that otherwise we will go on for time immemorial isn't it a fact doctor ang that that evidence of the accused's claim to this delusion had transpired in this court for a number of days already yes it is a fact that he said it that yes i accept that but it is a fact that he said it that's right in examination-in-chief yes it is a fact that he was cross-examined by my learned friend yes severely on this point yes it is a fact that the prosecution had given evidence of his statement to the investigating officer about his claim doctor ang not the delusion that he imagined all right that he imagined it was a fact by then that you also had doctor nagulendran's report about this delusion yes wouldn't you agree doctor ang that the central issue in this case is whether or not there was such a delusion yes together with the claim that he was suffering i think from a major depression isn't the evidence and the claims the arguments pertaining to this point the central issue in our case yes wouldn't you agree doctor ang that perhaps the case turns on the findings of the court in respect of this issue yes now that being the case if i may refer you to your own report p one hundred and eighteen you did not even make a single reference to that testimony yes i did not make reference to it agreed you didn't refer to that at all be it a delusion or imagination or a claim or a fact you made absolutely no reference to that whatsoever in your report yes i did not make any reference to it in fact doctor in your so-called final report which you claimed you took into consideration the evidence adduced at the trial you left out this issue which you admit to be central to the entire proceedings completely out of your report i considered it i don't care whether you considered did you or did you not leave it out in your report doctor ang yes i left it out that's all i want you to say doctor ang would you not agree with me that any person not sitting in this court listening to this trial and has the benefit only of your report will probably get the impression that no such thing ever transpired in court no it would just be that in spite of my having listened to the evidence which has been adduced in court i had not included it because there was no evidence doctor ang i hadn't asked why you left it out so please but i have to explain it i will give you more than ample chance to explain doctor ang you'll have the floor my question is very simple you are a very experienced man doctor ang a man's life is at stake a boy's life is at stake doctor ang any person would you not agree with me doctor ang any person not knowing what transpired in court reading your report will conclude that no such testimony was ever given in this court yes doctor ang any person who does not know what happened in his court reading your report will not have the slightest idea that the accused had given testimony that i was deluded as the hero in shanghai bank yes anyone reading it would not have this sort of information yes anyone reading this also doctor ang will not know that for days we were here arguing on this point yes but please save the but you will have time for your buts doctor ang anybody just reading your report will have no inkling whatsoever about that point don't you agree with me doctor yes i agree fully that anybody reading your report would have a serious gap in the nature of the case and the nature of the evidence and the nature of the testimony that transpired but the outcome of the case is to be decided by the lordships not by any person reading it yes i agree i will come to why you said that but anybody reading this will probably conclude that no such thing ever happened in this court is it not doctor ang yes do you think it is fair for you to make a report like this no i think the report reflects my opinion on the matter and i'll be giving evidence in court before the lordships so anything could always be raised doctor ang you earlier said that page one hundred and eighteen reflects your opinion yes my conclusions it reflects my conclusions on the testimony that was given in court yes my lords is it fair therefore a central issue to be ignored by you i never ignored it it was considered ignored in this report doctor ang all i am saying is not argued out in the report but it was certainly considered but i concluded but did any person reading this report did you express any opinion on this particular fact no it is although not stated but the conclusion covers that aspect of my formulation of my thinking how how how could your conclusion be based on a fact that you didn't mention no these facts had been brought out doctor ang explain to us your mental process how you can formulate an opinion without a reference to a fact of course the fact that it was not written that the argument was not set out in the report does not mean that it wasn't not argued not set out in the report you described the antecedents and precedents that's right in fact very briefly i described i did not go into great details and i think what matters most was my conclusion and i would be answerable to the court to explain how i came to such a conclusion now whether a person outside reading it is aware of the whole proceedings or not i don't think it really matters coomaraswamy:- may it please your lordship  now doctor please refer to page three of p one hundred and eighteen your final report under the heading of antecedents to the incident have you got it yes my lord doctor by this you meant it is your account as to the events leading to the incident this is a very brief summary of the events leading to it brief nevertheless but as far as you were concerned these were events leading to the incident as you saw it yes would you agree with me doctor that nowhere in your report did you mention about the accused taking the two revolvers with him yes i left it out in fact this account is based very much on my interview with him and also probably supplemented by the things i heard in court and also a little bit of background information i obtained from inspector ng's summary so it is only meant just as an introduction outlining the summary of events relevant events right these were events which you saw as relevant in your summary yes 
Singapore	doctor wee if i may be permitted to go through the injuries with you look at the external injuries according to the post-mortem report the external injuries started from one two three four five and so on we will start with the first one superficial cut on the left forehead across the left upper eyelid do you have a copy of the photographs you are taking doctor wee through the external injuries through all the slash wounds and stab wounds and with reference to the photographs yes first injury on your medical report doctor wee could you take a look yes this is seen in p thirty-one p thirty-one superficial cut on left forehead is it this is a cut on the face around the eye and down to the cheek on the face right yes the one you see in p thirty-one yes coming down the nose is it inner aspect of the left inner aspect of the left eye all right that is the first injury this would be consistent doctor wee with would it be consistent with injury caused by a sharp object sharp instrument such as a parang yes the tip of the parang the second injury doctor wee is a slash wound with sharp edges and forked anterior tip over the occipita-parietal scalp where would that this is seen in p thirty-four and thirty-five p thirty-four shows the injury with the hair still on his head yes and p thirty thirty-five with the head shaved yes could you briefly describe this wound to us it has not penetrated the skull it did not crack the skull or it did not go into the skull cavity or affected the brain but it has cut through the skin and flesh of the head until it reaches the skull yes it only cut the thickness of the scalp and outer table of the skullbone and this would also be consistent with the injuries caused by a sharp instrument like that of parang third injury doctor wee is an tangential slash wound yes this is seen in p thirty-five p thirty-five also and thirty-three this is where part of the scalp being slashed off yes one moment p thirty-three and thirty-five thirty-three is the injury somewhere near the ear is it yes where part of the scalp is sliced off doctor wee could you see photographs eight and nine yes would that be the piece of scalp that had been sliced off yes it would my lord the scale in eight and nine was found in the hotelroom yes and this injury is again consistent with that caused by a sharp instrument like that of a parang before i go on to the other i go on to the injuries first the neck has no injuries no the injury on the chest there is a vertical slash wound on the right anterior shoulder with sharp edges where can you find this it is seen in p thirty-five and thirty-one there is a deep slash wound on the right shoulder isn't it yes again sharp instrument sharp instrument yes a sharp instrument like that of a parang and there is the fifth injury on the report which is the fatal stab wound fifth injury fatal stab wound triangular stab wound left anterolateral mid-chest wall where can we find this p twenty-eight and thirty-one let's look at it twenty-eight shows about three stab wounds which of these the one nearest the left nipple would your lordship want doctor wee to mark the injury no near the nipple we can see that yes and the same injury can also be seen my lord in p thirty-one yes it is also near the left nipple compared to the other injuries so far seen looking at the photograph it doesn't seem to be a very serious one but i suppose doctor wee is going to explain to us yes could you describe to us the wound and tell us why it is the fatal wound this is a triangular stab wound it penetrated the full thickness of the chest wall it went into the right side of the heart because there was penetration into the heart i considered that this wound was the fatal wound the most serious of the most serious of the rest now this wound doctor wee would be consistent with how would you say this wound had been caused yes with what instrument would this wound be caused it's caused by a sharp instrument which is triangular on cross-section sharp doctor wee means pointed as opposed to the sharpness of a parang the edges of a parang yes it is a pointed instrument yes sharp pointed instrument what he means is it's a pointed instrument a pointed sharp in that a pointed instrument can you give us some examples pointed tip like a bearing scraper anything else any other sharp instrument that is triangular on cross-section can you explain the expression triangular on cross-section the blade if one were across and look at it it should be triangular it is a cross-section yes taking a cross-section of it and when we look at it it is triangular in shape yes so it could be something like a bearing scraper a metal file a sharp metal file with a pointed tip which is triangular in shape would that yes it would would that instrument be consistent with the wound caused by such an instrument a metal what did you say mister a sharp pointed metal file with a triangular shape metal file with a triangular cross-section no no leave the cross-section alone moderate force moderate force was used you need only a moderate force to penetrate with this type of instrument yes and while we are still at this injury perhaps you can tell us from your observation would an assailant who uses this instrument would he be which position would he be vis-a-vis the deceased would you be able to tell us looking at the wound and the track most likely to be a frontal frontal attack frontal attack yes we go on to the next wound doctor wee before i go to the next wound this wound and the four other wounds which you have just described would you say that they are caused by different instruments yes it cannot be the same instrument no definitely a different instrument yes it was not a parang anyway no this fifth wound was not caused by a parang no could not have been that explains the difference in the wounds as shown in the photographs yes wound number six this is also another stab wound right anterolateral mid chest wall where can you find before you go to the sixth wound mister seng can you ask him some questions on or would you be coming back to it later as to the cause of death i will go through the wounds first and then all right very well so that we have an idea of what the wounds are before very well and because the witness said that is a fatal wound we will come back to that later i'll be asking him about the other wound as well now you are on the sixth wound yes where is it to be found where can you find the sixth wound doctor wee sorry the picture is not very clear it is at the side of p thirty-one it is very hard to see perhaps you could mark the or show his lordship where the wound is circle it and mark number six yes that is the sixth wound p thirty-one and would you say that this wound could be caused by the same instrument or similar instrument that has caused the fifth wound yes consistent with the triangular sharp instrument yes not a parang no now the seventh wound which is a slash wound number seven where can you find this wound in the photographs p thirty-two there are two the one nearer the neck yes there are two wounds two very clear wounds yes nearer the armpit yes the one near the armpit the bigger of the two wounds shown on the photograph yes and this would he consistent with that caused by a parang yes a parang slashed caused by a parang and the eighth slash wound it is the one below the seventh wound yes that is also consistent with that caused by a sharp object like a parang yes like a parang the ninth wound is a stab wound at the abdomen which photograph would that be p twenty-eight there are three there the one nearest the navel the one in the centre yes has your lordship got it yes that is the ninth stab yes the other one is of course the fatal wound isn't it that is at the nipple yes doctor wee my first question is taking the injuries as a whole all the injuries if the deceased had been rushed to hospital immediately would he likely have been saved no any possibility what time frame are you speaking about mr tan immediately after he sustained the injuries my lord i know immediately means within two minutes or ten minutes or what within ten minutes if he had been rushed to the hospital not likely is it a question of degree or is it simply improbable to save his life improbable and even if you are given half a day to treat him would you be able to save his life sorry i didn't hear the question if a team of doctors are given half a day to treat his injuries would his life be saved unlikely you see the doctor has already said if he was rushed to hospital within ten minutes he was unlikely to be saved how could a team of doctors for half a day do anything better yes carry on i read in the report doctor wee the time of death was at zero zero forty-eight minutes after midnight forty-eight minutes after midnight yes doctor wee could you tell the court when did the ambulance arrive mister tan just to follow your line of cross-examination the ambulance arrived at about i think the ambulance arrived fairly quickly isn't it from the call about nine minutes about ten minutes later he was sent to the hospital that is right that is my recollection yes my lord what i want to confirm is the time of death doctor wee where did you get the information from this information was given to us on the police three zero three report and the medical officer in charge at the hospital must have certified death now do you have a copy of that certification here no but it was stated in the three zero three police report that doctor meret certified death at zero zero forty-eight hours  i solemnly and sincerely swear that the evidence i will be giving in this court shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth witness can you please state your name to the court my name is tan gan kiat your honour that's g-a-n k-i-a-t can you tell the court how old you are and where are you attending school i am eighteen years old and studying at singapore polytechnic which faculty mechanical engineering witness on the twenty-six of september nineteen ninety-nine what were you doing i was playing football at yuan ching secondary school your honour that's y-u-a-n c-h-i-n-g now at what time did the game start in the morning about ten am how many people were there my team has fifteen persons including three girls one of them is my girlfriend the other team has about fifteen boys witness do you know these other persons no then why did you play with them they came later and asked us whether we would like to challenge them and we said okay  witness can you tell the court what colour were your jerseys my team was wearing blue and white puma jerseys and shorts the other team just wore their casual clothes can you please tell the court during the game what happened about half-way through i saw three persons surrounding my girlfriend where were you when you saw this i was still in the field playing football who were the three persons that were surrounding your girlfriend they were from the other team but they were just watching the game please continue then what happen i heard my girlfriend shouted kiat kiat so i ran to her and told the three of them to go away then one of them told me to mind my own business i told them to not get violent and talk it out then one of them slapped me witness where was your girlfriend at this time she is beside me on my left witness could you recognise the person who slapped you yes how can you recognise him because he was standing in front of me is this person who slapped you in this court room today yes can you please point him out he is the one wearing a blue shirt 
Singapore	may may i uh you see actually we we are a canadian firm but we have a joint venture with the overseas union bank group here alright and uh whatever you do buy from us if you do buy from us uh is valid internationally should you and your husband migrate or choose to work overseas uh this plan is internationally valid and uh should something politically happen to singapore you can still claim your money outside singapore alright now you at the moment uh you you are married but you don't have any kids yet huh okay now there are some reasons why i ask that question now this firstly this is a covering letter and this ex explains all the concepts of our program here now one what is very unusual about this plan is the parent-child option if you for example next year if you choose to start a family now when your son reaches eighteen or twenty-one assuming you have a boy it can be a girl but i'll just say boy if if your son reaches eighteen or twenty-one if you don't want your plan you can transfer it to your child so when your child you transfer it to your child it's like a legacy that you pass to your child so your child at twenty-one will inherit your plan if you so wish to transfer to him but he will pay the rate of a small baby based on the year he was born so that's a tremendous cost-saving you see and it is also without evidence of insurability now without evidence of insurability means that even if your child is born healthy but later on he develops a medical problem he can inherit your plan you see now this uh rider is given free to you and none of our competitors have got this feature here now the other feature that we have is the disability part uh uh i believe your husband is also with the varsity here okay now uh whatever occupation you're doing now if by injury or accident or disease due to sickness you can't do your current occupation we will pay you the full sum insured over five years if you buy from our competitors it's over ten years and you must be like a complete vegetable you see so this is the two different criterias uh now i'll i'll just explain to you the quantitative features then it's more easy for you you see what i've covered is just the uh just the brief concept now this is a covering letter these are the brochures now this is the uh core program now the core program is the actual program itself then hooked on the onto the actual programs are the riders riders are external features which are hooked onto the pro program you see so this is the one that parent-child option which is given free to you you can pass it to your first-born kid alright uh this is lifeline now lifeline is medical rider now uh if a person is infected with any of this disease a heart attack stroke invasive cancer invasive cancer means any cancer that is growing can be any part of the body kidney failure organ transplant multiple sclerosis viral hepatitis and heart disease requiring surgery then the the money will be paid one of below there's no restriction on how you use your money you see now uh now so assuming that now let's say if you buy just hundred twenty thousand uh your annual premium annual when i say annual i mean it's paid on a uh on an annual basis it's one five six three point nine but you can also pay through a monthly giro monthly giro means that the premium is deducted on a monthly basis from your bank account you see and that is only one three eight point zero nine which is not very much actually and that covers your hundred twenty thousand now what does it cover you're covered against any form of death whether by external disease for hundred twenty thousand should that occur we pay hundred and twenty thousand to you now if you become disabled disabled can be due to many reasons uh it can be due to disease or injury or accident you know disease for example a heart attack stroke things like that uh you and you cannot do your current occupation which is that of a teacher lect uh researcher then we will pay the hundred and twenty thousand to you over five years so you get twenty percent every year for five years if you buy from any of our competitors they will pay you ten percent per year for ten years and you have to be totally disabled like a vegetable uh so now that is the disability part and if you should get any of the diseases here we will pay you fifty thousand we will pay fifty thousand one off how what we what you do with the money is your wish there's no restriction you see now under this plan mrs uh lee you only pay for thirteen years after that it is given free to you the program becomes self-financing after thirteen years in other words after thirteen years you don't have to pay for the program if you choose not to but the coverage still goes on you see now uh assuming of course you want to give up the plan so let's take it as one possible scenario at the age of sixty-five if you choose to give up your program at at sixty-five i think that's a good age because chances are the government may raise the retirement age to sixty-five you see so if you give that up you get back sixty-one thousand and thirty-six dollars now what you need to do is not to look at the absolute figure but take the index ratio now what do you mean by index ratio is take the money that you'll get back divide by how much you have put in in other words what you'll get back uh as a ratio of what you have input into the program now if you divide this by what you have put into the program is a return of three dollars that means for every dollar that you put in eventually you're getting like three dollars here okay so three dollars now you must also note that you're only paying for thirteen years so take your current age plus thirteen that gives you forty-one so that means from the age of forty-one you're not paying you're still covered alright and at sixty-five when you give up you get back this so in other words from forty-one to sixty-five you're enjoying free coverage now how much is that forty-five to sixty-five uh forty-one to sixty-five that's about twenty-four years free coverage so twenty-four times one six one three oh uh times one five six three that's the annual premium that is your opportunity cost saving you see and uh if you were uh to get any disease listed here on diagnosis we will pay you fifty thousand straightaway but if you don't get the disease but just death or disability takes place we'll still pay this this amount here so in other words this doubles up as an insurance you see an insurance which is paid to you one off on diagnosis of disease but at the same time if you don't get a disease we will still pay you on death or disability so there are two concepts here one is a saving concept which you will you will get when you terminate the plan if nothing has happened and the other concept is the coverage concept which pays you on death or disability or on diagnosis of any disease here i i'm going i hope it's clear clear to you now this is only a summary of this uh because i realise that you may not have much time so usually when i'm dealing with professionals or business people uh i uh do uh summary for them you see now you can see this is the premium column now after thirteen years it's free in other words you can see all zeros you're not paying now cash value is your surrender value that means the money which is returned to you when you voluntarily terminate the plan okay so this is the sixty-five mark here which i told you now this is the policy here mrs mrs lee policy here this is your age summarised at five-year intervals so you can see when you are sixty-five if you terminate you get back this if you give up at seventy you get back this which is even more so it acts also as an old age sav saving scheme for you but you must note that after forty-one you are not paying now this is the coverage on your life so on death we pay this amount depending when the occurrence takes place now uh i mean of course nobody likes to talk about such things but we have to explain to you so if the occurrence takes place on the tenth year then this amount is paid to you but on disability we pay this amount over five years which i explain to you just now on death whole amount is paid on disability over five years but on diagnosis of the disease is here fifty thousand is paid as an advance one off alright now this is one side of the story that means after fourteen years you're not paying now the other now this a medical part which is included here now the other side of the story is that after fourteen years you may be doing very well in your career whether here or somewhere else and you may choose to keep on paying so we give you two alternatives after thirteen fourteen years you can go for free or you can keep on paying if you want to now if you keep on paying you must note the premium remains the same there's no change uh but it is fully paid up at sixty-five now look at the annual premium column this is a running total uh accumulative total of all the premiums you have paid now look at sixty-five and seventy can you see the figures are the same there's no change it means that it is fully paid up at sixty-five so af after sixty-five even if you want to pay also we don't want to accept the money but if you're still covered you know now so uh now this is your surrender value uh mrs lee you can see when you give up at sixty-five you get hundred forty thousand as compared to just now uh sixty-five you get sixty-one thousand you get hundred forty so it is more than double now of course if you keep on paying your interest grows faster there's no doubt about that so when you stop paying there's a slowdown of your growth rate of your bonuses and your interest so you can see that at sixty-five when you terminate you get this now if you terminate at seventy you get hundred and eighty-six thousand now if you terminate at eighty it will be even more now this plan you stop paying at sixty-five it's fully paid up you see why but the coverage will go until ninety nine years of age until such time as you don't want the plan and you terminate it then we'll pay you the cash surrender value so under this plan or under most insurance plans there are two concepts one is the cash surrender value that is a savings element and the other one is the coverage there's always these two concepts you see now this is the death benefit uh so on the event of death we pay this amount  how much you check off against the year here alright now this is a policy year we run it from one to twenty this is a summary of your age at five-year intervals right now it will go on until nineteen ninety but i stop at seventy because there's no place for the computer printout so this is what we pay on death ah in the event of diagnosis of disease fifty thousand is paid one off and uh on disability we pay over five years the full amount you see now this is the medical part which is included there already now this is the interesting part nuh the parent-child option which i was explaining to you i i do not know whether you're planning to start a family soon if i'm not right right uh let's say you you have a kid now i i just run a hypothetical example alright let's say you have a kid now uh uh a son you just born of course uh it doesn't mean that you must have a son now you can have a son two years from now you see and then you can register him under this rider which is given free to you if you buy the plan so when your son is eighty one if you transfer the plan to your son we will give you back twenty-six thousand alright your son's coverage will start at hundred and twenty thousand but he is only paying this premium rate per month per year sorry per year now this you can see is an extremely cheaf cheap rate of seven hundred and four dollars per year and that is twenty-one years from now assuming hypothetically that you have a new-born son now but if you have a son two years from now the rate is even cheaper you see because your son is not born yet so the rate is seven o four per year alright and uh this money is given back to you this is his insurance this is his premium now we can extrapolate uh into the into the future so let's say you have passed to your son at twenty-one when your son is sixty years of age uh if you terminate the plan you will get back he will get back two hundred eighty-five thousand and this coverage will be this amount here this is his coverage when he's sixty years of age we are now projecting into the future but all the time he's only paying this premium which is that of a small baby just born you see if i can just show you by a straight line graph uh you see let's call let's look at this this is premium rate and this is uh age huh so uh are you familiar with statistics uh now as you get older and older mrs lee your premium rate will increase but once you have bought the plan the rate is fixed you see so it depends where you come on board you see alright now the older you are of course the more expensive it is because we are more susceptible to diseases so assuming now your son when he's twenty-one you pass him the plan by right he should be paying this premium rate here alright of a twenty-one year old but actually what he's paying is this premium rate here of a newborn infant backdated to the year he was born you see that that is the whole concept you see but even if he your son is born healthy uh or your daughter is born healthy there is no guarantee that they will remain healthy until twenty-one you see so even along the way if they develop a medical problem at twenty-one they are guaranteed of this uh of this plan you you know what i'm trying to say now basically this is the the plan that we have been selling quite a lot of it around here to to the to uh i've some of it in the law faculty you see uh this is the summary alright this is a summary whereby you stop paying after fourteen years this one you have the option of paying till sixty-five you know after fourteen years you need not stop you can keep on paying till sixty-five then you follow this scenario here then this is your covering letter and this is a brochure which explains a bit of what i have just told you the parent's option alright where you can pass it to your kid and uh i've also enclosed one plan for your husband in case he may be interested to have a talk 
Singapore	26 march 1992 how progress helps you to downsize  uh so come to uh this session uh i'm joseph liew i'm from base management system we are the distributor for progress in singapore uh graph sizing computing application from mainframe and microcomputers to pc lan is one of the hottest trend in uh corporate computing today okay mis challenged by uh increasing cost pressure uh accelerating business changes and competition uh we are also faced with technological change and complexity uh also shifting management structure all these business uh pressures have actually forced mis to rely on either out outside what you call outsourcing or downsizing and according to the recent survey sixty to seventy percent of fortune thousand companies are in the actively in downsizing project or plan to get started within the next twelve months many companies are searching for low cost computing options and a desire to improve the flexibility of computing application instead of running all uhm corporate application on mainframe or micro mis director now find that uhm there are many application that can run perfectly well on small computer connected in a network environment a well-constructed uh network can house plenty of computing power today uh the components of all these uh network configuration uh people are using things like personal computers workstation pass server database server and it can be if you can uh appropriate size and then uh plug in or plug up uhm the environment you can make your application uh run very uh successfully according to the needs uhm it takes okay you can plug in or out from the environment moving uh application to smaller computer if you have done it correctly you can achieve the following: one substantially uh lower the operation cost while improving flexibility second enjoy the same computing power and benefit of a mainframe or microcomputer at only a fraction of cost you can also realize greater flexibility when it comes to development support and ongoing maintenance you have at your disposal more flexible tool for development and support and also more scaleable platform for ongoing maintenance move away you can also move away from uh this what call  word computing boxes towards more open or at least uh reusable hardware in some cases the server of today uh can be downsized to the workstation end-user workstation of tomorrow another key to im uh improving flexibility of system is the movement away from the third generation development languages like cobol or c okay so uh you are i i believe uh all of you come to this show uh you have more or less decided to adopt downsizing as a company strategy to improve your practical advantages and better leverage your information investment now the challenge is uh you is on you as to how you should take application that were mainframe or microcomputer and uh orientated uh and bring it down to a uh low-end uh pc lan environment downsizing doesn't uh equate to a reducing software development time and cost uh at least not automatically uh creating software for a downsized system can entail significantly higher cost than for a mainframe environment especially if it's done with a third generation language traditionally used to develop large mainframe software like cobol or c because such languages assume that an application will run on a single computer they do not directly support distribution or processing and data over her heterogeneous network of geographically dispersed computers the principal requirement for most application running in a downsized environment consequently using a third generation language to downsize application entail designing and coding support for network computing into the application software itself which is a also a major ah undertaking so is manager under pressure to downsize need a more powerful breed of uh application development tool you need an effective downsizing environment that meets the combined requirements of integrity and reliability security and straightforward setup and maintenance you need support from two for planning and design that's why uhm we are trying to uh introduce you progress how progress can actually help you to solve the increasing business pressure in terms of lower the cost adapting to change business change and uh supporting machine uh of management structures okay let me bring you uh to progress uh product itself progress actually offer the complete uh application development system progress has got its own fourth 4 gl with sql we also have a fast track what you call is a application user can actually paint screen uhm create menu and adhoc reports using this uh fast track progress also had its own data dictionary and its own relational database this uh progress fourth 4 gl actually is a very elegant procedural and now you can create procedural and non-procedural statements uh if you are uh using the default or the uh progress command uh you can actually uh cut short a lot of development time uh inside this uh there is a enter where it will do the normal syntax checking for you uh while you are phototyping your application you also have a on-line help facility within the enter you can do what are like key-stroke level programming control uh progress also support old uh sql and you are writing any uh things to communicate with your hardware uh word peripheral if you require to use c to do the communication or whatever progress do support uh c interface for this special purpose progress actually give you a high level support for many tasks common to transaction processing and information access such as database manipulation and screen and report processing enables creation of downsized application in a fraction of a time required inverted g if you are a this uh fast track is actually a menu-driven application user which is very ideal for uh rapid phototyping you can paste screens design menu and reports it can also perform uh ad-hoc database query and the fast track itself is actually written uh on progress so uh whatever things you you are making use to do it will generate the reusable fourth 4 gl code for you so you can actually make use of this fourth 4 gl code and uh bring it in and cut and paste into your application procedure and you can save this uh course in the library and as and when you can uh bring this out to uh cut and paste or do some modification to suit your application requirement progress also support development of uh application distributed across heterogeneous computer networks uh it automatically handle uh the distributed processing such as uh communication re re remote processes and accessing the ah store in uh other computer and progress actually support hundreds of uh hard hardware uh we also support the operating system like dos os/2 uh in respaced kind of system running unix or os/2 you have also uhm workstation running unix or bms all those uh application that is developed using progress fourth 4) gl you can actually port it over to any of these supported platform without having to change any the user interface and so on uh actually are identical across all the platforms in this occasion uh you can easily uh plug on or unplug the uh system from this network as and when uh you know information needs to word progress has got its own interactive data dictionary which allow you to uh control things like file and field validation this is very good for you to uh make use to uh checking input validation rules it also support uh password only authorized uh user can then access to these uh field level and it also provide database uh trigger to ensure specific processing on key events other than that uh in the dictionary itself you also can store the gateway information to alternate database for instance you may have uh other databases uh not uh third party one not support uh it will be sup it's uh supported by program like oracle rdd ims ci etceteras okay uh you also can store the what you call network protocol information within the data dictionary itself the data dictionary will then dynamically connect or disconnect uhm to all databases required by your application if you do not word to uh have any uh transaction over the other databases uh progress will disconnect it for you so that you will enhance the power and other things like uh it will host the  word import and also the export facility within this uh data dictionary progress has a uh its own relational database this actually eliminates the need to acquire or develop sep separate rddms interface routine and assure that application written in progress fourth 4 gl are able to use all of the features of the rddm ms you can uh access from the environment menu alone with the source code editor compiler debugger and other tools this will speed compiler development our database and the program that will use those databases uh second it can it also provide capability to safeguard uh against system as well as human failure one uh to prevent corruption of the database as a result of system failure data roll back is provided automatic uh purging from the database of all transaction left incomplete by a system failure the next function is to uh guard against non-recoverable disk failure you have things like roll forward can be uh you can enable locking or transaction to a second disk in the event of main disk uh fail the system can recreate the database by merging the transaction uh with the last archive uh copy of the database in this relational database we also support things like uh flexible uh record locking control we have uh we support multi word server for high performances you can connect say uh up to two hundred and forty databases and uh you have you can have transaction like two thousand four hundred and seventy eight records update simultaneously within the database you can have uh things like on-line data backup uh progress also support two face word this is for distributed database word and there are tool provided to you for performance monitoring and word  progress also uh support client server uh architecture progress soft fourth 4 gl signif signifying the uh simplify the development of dispersed application possible by implementing a client server distributed computer model utilizing built-in protocol for co-ordination a client server model actually divide an application into two types of uh co-operating tasks: one those specific to the application and those common to a group of application a server perform the common task at the request of a client task and a client server model actually has uh several advantages: one it allow client to be developed uh independently of servers and reduce development time by eliminating one needs to write codes for those tasks handled by the server second client server model also support distributed processing by dividing an application into segments that can run on different processor or computers as long as communication can be established between them a server for a database used by multiple application can run on a time-shared central computer with a client running on workstation connected to time-shared system via a local area network such as uh such a configuration preserve the central control advantages of mainframe environment while offering uh loading application specific processing onto low-cost workstations these are all the uh operating systems supported by progress uh you can address dms ms-dos unix xenix altrix ais aus  word  right now progress also uh support uh as four hundred the os four hundred uh okay the application regardless where you develop the source from whether is it uh dos single-user or word system the source code where you are plotting to the next operating system or platform you do not have to rewrite any single code progress also provide uh connectivity across all the standard uh network protocol such as netbio pcpip word net spx ibx or os5  you can actually uh distribute your database across uh all other platforms when you are running the application progress the will  word will uh automatically point to you where the data is and you go and retrieve and access the data on the database regardless where it is stored progress databases uh can be can also be independent i mean those fourth 4 gl uh application developed using progress can access to ei either progress or to other databases like oracle rdd or ims progress also uh give you uh robust gateway uh besides the progress oracle ims rdd uh right now we can also support the ci word and uh  word will be uh releasing very soon 
Singapore	 10 april 1992  ya ya it's moving it's moving okay you can start presenting  word let me collect my thoughts okay uh maybe i maybe i ya would just run through a bit about the background lah uhm uh ya ya essentially okay lah i've some coverage uhm right uhm and i have been approached several time by different people about uh uhm the fact that the coverage is not sufficient you see uhm uh and and things like that uhm and i've also seen the several uh uh advertisement on the papers uhm plus also mails lah uhm that talk about uh that focuses on uhm low premium but uh having uh uhm  word is it uhm uh so i'm a bit curious as to uh what what does this offer versus the normal type of uh insurance coverage you see uhm seems like to me that uh this type uh gives protection uhm uh but uh it's not something that's for saving versus the life type that is both uh uhm coverage protecting protection and also saving lah yep that that seems to be the difference to me so that's the main diff but ya can i find out what you've got now uh okay i've got uh i've got uh i think i've i've got two ges uhm which which covers uh i think it's about two hundred plus k or thereabout are they all totally savings or word  saving one is endowment and the other one is life  word all hundred percent what is hundred percent that means there is no uhm no protection only insurance coupled into the program there are some riders ah i i don't know what whether you call them ya ya sure ya most of these riders would tend to just increase the cover without increasing the savings ya ya huh they are riders yes they they they're sort of uh composite lah but they're i don't have uh rider alone type if if you if you see what i'm talking about uhm how old are they just about maybe about two years i think you mean you took them together one after the other they uh sort of almost lah two years old lah uhm uhm okay so that's an endowment what is the typical uh range of coverage normally for most most most people it actually ties in to how much you want to put aside uhm how much you want to cater if you go off suddenly uhm uhm what are your outstanding uhm you know uhm that you'll things that you have to provide for so word  ya i mean you one-room flat kind of dweller it's more than sufficient income uhm if you have you know great visions for your sons and  word them for post-graduate or whatever uhm you know you will have to word for more lah okay okay uhm which which are the adverts you like i think there was the latest one i receive is uh cigna ah cigna ya uhm credit card one ya so that one is actually i think it's like uh you you every month you pay about twenty thirty dollars or something like that and the cover for fifty k or hundred k uhm they've i think sometime ago there was one that talk about uh that that came from uh uhm the one that's associated with ntuc i think uh income it it's not income but there there there's another one that there is another one uhm can't remember the name ics huh ics ya ya ya i think it's ics uh that that was on the papers ya but several of these uh credit card ones also uh provide uh this type of uh uh protection only type of uh coverage from the protection only insurance you want know about it or are you in the position to say yes i think i need more insurance but i want to get maximum protection for minimum amount only uhm what's your state of mind right now uh i'm just trying to explore uh what are the various offerings uh in terms of protection only uhm and and then maybe make an assessment whether i can afford or i can't afford ah okay let me just run through quickly uhm uhm they come in many names lah okay oh basically there're of a temporary nature uhm have you got time no no no i've i've enough time uhm okay and that's twenty minutes word  ya so you get of a temporary the tension is released after that huh ya can disclose more confidential information okay it's of a temporary nature uhm the ones which the credit cards normally offer are yearly renewable oh okay what does that mean it's goes year by year uhm and it's subject to the company renewing it ya oh it it it possibly uhm normally the structure would be the premium will be stepped that means is it with i thought from the from this age group to this age group is this price oh okay okay uhm and i think over and above sixty or sixty five they don't want to insure you any more oh okay okay uhm and sometimes they've already word  in this they might do an average uhm okay uhm but it it's it's generally either one or the other lah uhm okay uhm it's the main difference is whether you want to ensure that it does its job or not uhm or do you want to only insure for x number of years and are happy that it runs out uhm okay right that that as far as i'm concerned my my responsibility to my family is only until i'm fifty by after which anything happens to me you guys are on your own something like that ya it it's it's how you look at it okay if you're looking at cash at or or okay providing cash and there there's an end-point of time then you would rule this out because you don't have any temporary type insurances which last your whole life long it will definitely expire this this one uh uhm ya their low premium word  anyway it doesn't it doesn't give you cash right it doesn't there's no savings uh ya ya it's just protection ya it's it's money gone once you pay up ya it's it's like a car insurance word  right right no accident okay okay okay uhm i think sometimes they calculate with an accident insurance and they bundle it all together uhm what do you mean by that accident accident are you familiar with personal accident insurances uh no no uh it pays if you have an accident and you you don't survive you get disabled uhm loose limbs fingers word  oh oh okay okay that kind of thing ya ya ya uh i think that's provided by cia cigna ya cia cigna ya uh it it normally they they do it hand in hand uh uhm they package it such that it looks very cheap because uhm statistically death and disability by accidents is actually very small uhm percentage small risks as compared to all disabilities and all death cau causes of death disabilities so these premiums are very low uhm and they couple it with one that's only for limited period they can bring down the premiums lah uhm okay uhm what else do you need to know uhm uhm the let me try and recall okay there's this other type which what is it uh have have you heard this critical illness oh ya the word eleven insurance ya ya something like that ya that one is also comes under this type of category oh okay okay okay ya i think uh cigna that did mention that also word cannot recall cigna word  well i would classify it under critical illness type uhm uhm they pay on diagnosis uhm right uhm it's sort of an enhanced uhm insurance over and above uhm just the purely temporary type okay or the purely accident type okay uhm of course because it's an enhanced variety it costs you uhm okay risks are higher because you don't have to die okay you just need to suffer one of the following uhm that's what it is okay okay uh what else do they have i think that's basically it lah it's it's only in the packaging uhm uhm i don't know whether uhm how you you are the how the cheapest in the market go for it type or what uh rough overview lah that's all i can think of right now ya ya okay uhm for this how difficult is it to claim uhm not difficult lah not difficult because i understand there were some there there're some medical terminology involved it doesn't mean that you have a pain in the heart then you know that's it uh i've spoken to our doctors uhm normal doctors lah which are on our med panel uh they think it's a fair definition is that right uh they think it it's actually good that these things are spelt out quite clearly  word  well as long as the doctor says you've got a heart attack uhm we should pay up uhm i mean you can't claim based on certain symptoms that i have a heart attack uhm when ecgy and everything ys you don't of course that's just word so okay uhm these tend to be more popular nowadays lah uhm being a more affluent society ya so we've more affluent diseases ya that's true uhm the criteria for underwriting would basically be your health and your parents' health oh parents' health oh okay in case of hereditary diseases ya like diabetes kidney you know which that kind of thing uhm kidney failure can can be a cause right right right so if if your folks or if your parents are not alive and they suf they died of cancer and all uhm it might be a minus lah uhm from the underwriting point okay so the advantage of this is that it gives you protection uhm however word  it's on a temporary nature lah the the one thing the advantage is actually the cost lah ya what normally what we do when we propose is we normally package it with a savings type policy uhm because if if you look at it over the long period of cover uhm uhm it's basically an expense uhm uhm ya for this and it's sometimes they specially uhm work it into the policy that it increases uh huh ten percent a year some personalised word  the premium or protection ya protection oh okay uhm but most of them don't uh huh uh so you would you're actually paying and paying and paying lah is that right as opposed to a savings policy where effectively your savings and you're offsetting the premiums through the years oh uh huh because if if you if you have a savings value you've got premium outlay uhm and as it as the savings increases and your premiums remain in constant uhm you are actually offsetting the premium uhm just like an account that you're depositing all the time and not withdrawing i i don't understand that part what what do you how do you offset this thing again okay there's a portion in your present insurances which provides for savings right right and you could put in your premiums as if they're deposits uhm  word  uhm i'm sure your agent would've explained to you that it probably starts from the third year onwards right uhm uhm oh okay so so if if let's say you deposit say two thousand dollars okay and year one year two year three  uhm you've hit six thousand dollars uhm uhm and year three begins your savings value according to your about three thousand dollars uhm uhm so if you net it uhm you're hardly would have actually been three thousand uhm so over the three years it would actually cost you oh oh okay out of pocket one thousand a year uhm uhm so as as you go down through the years uhm there'll be a break-even point sometime like eleven years okay ya okay where effectively you've only lost interest uhm and through the years there'll be a net return so in that sense oh oh okay there's no loss i see i see okay uhm so all the interest lah ya but there's i think there's a offsetting along the way finally catch up is that right there is a small cost involved in insurance oh the you pay significantly more premiums as compared to a temporary insurance the term insurance uhm uh but a lot of it is already word in the savings element uhm you see uhm it it it cost maybe say fifty dollars or thirty dollars for a term it might cost you a hundred and fifty dollars for the same amount of insurance uhm so that the insurance part is actually thirty dollars right but hundred and twenty would actually go into savings lah  word uh huh if you look at it from that point of view uhm uhm okay okay that's what i meant lah uhm 
Singapore	 5 june 1992  it is interactive right now we have one hundred thousand pages which means that one hundred thousand pages in our word system in our word  singapore telecom we work with eighty three service providers service providers are the people that provide the information okay we do not provide the information what we do is word the central system the service provider provide the information and you as the/your  word users will retrieve the information from the main database okay so we have one hundred thousand pages okay these are some of the services that we have okay we have adequate education packages infotainment as in informat information and entertainment business banking and finally uh concept word services these are some of the things that are incorporated into yes you can see excuse me so what you have here is this the user now there are two ways the user could communicate with the main computer it's either by uachat word or through the pstn that's the public service telephone network now if by any chance the reception is not good okay the machine will automatically tape word into the pstn which means that you'll be communicating with us through the public service telephone network the development through the public service telephone network may not be as quick as its give you an example let me give you an example this is the main page this is what are the services that are available what we are is information now the information you may obtain may be eased uh you may obtain it through some other means but the fact is this is convenient

me a moment everyone is using the same package everyone is except if you subscribe to the teleview it's accessed through the same node yes it is ya it is accessible i mean the information is uh say unless you you want to get into access through close word user group then you pay a small ya access to what lowest user group now close user group uh uh services a provider word  to a very specific model uh huh  word those user group uh for a minimum sum maybe some services service providers require maybe twenty five dollars for a month then you will subscribe now you know that information is only for you and to a selected number of people say maybe fifty or hundred or those who who subscribe directly to word  what are those information uh philips securities is one of them if/ain't word  that many closer there are many close user groups uh these are service providers and they want to cater information to a selected  word remember singapore telecom in teleview we're providing information we work together with service providers none are hardware business with word information information that is growing right now a hundred thousand pages ten thousand customers eighty three service providers and then this is only the tip of the iceberg that's going we are at the forefront of information okay so the education education we have what we call for primary school students a very comprehensive supplementary program that uh supplements the cur current school curriculum we have a smart packed program a smart packed program is some kind of you know have you heard of the kinkino assessment program uh children do work on assessments they are tested okay with here what you do is you do your test on this thing but you can only do it once your test and you are graded and you are ranked so you roughly know where you are as opposed to as compared to the comparing yourself with the other student(s go ahead and have a have a try now um okay who are the people that uh program all these information on education who are these people singapore chinese teachers' union singapore tamil(s) teachers' union singapore malay teachers union and the main body singapore  word uh singapore teachers' union we work closely with them they're our main one of our main service providers through education now for the smart program is done by the singa all these four uh teachers' union and we gear them towards asking them to provide uh tests that are slightly a shade more difficult how often is it being updated the information information now certain certain things are rated uh we there are six smart caps uh six which are in smart cap uh word  six this is this is a line word six this will explain to you what smart cap is and nuh it's it it's uh mathematics science english chinese all the and all the other test program uh you can have this one let me get you another one these are just only pieces of service directory  word another copy now one of the key things about this thing as opposed to some other learning aid is the fact that for children at the primary school level you have graphics you know colourful it draws the attention and uh it is not never dull there there's never a dull moment you you you get children onto computers at a very young age and it's only what nine dollars now nine dollars is the subscription a month which is nine dollars do you have a computer at okay it's a model two two thirty uh on a two eighty six a three eighty six or four eighty six now there're two ways of communicating can you get into the demo demo page uh teleview is communicator is interactive teletext's system is one way teleview in two way we set it by  word and you communicate with the machine through a pstn public service telephone network uh you come with if there's no if the reception is poor by some interference it'll automatically word  and everything will be done through the pstn so remember it's communicative it's it's interactive and uh and for nine dollars only a month subscription now we offer here for two hundred and thirty five dollars a modem and a receiver card now receiver card if by modem if you were to you choose by modem the development is much is slightly slower if it  word with with a rf card receiver card fast development fast retrieve development c4: so uh if let's say we're using television there's uh no... television this is is it c4: without the others  word ya it's a mark two it's only five fifty you all if you're using a computer i do not need to get that no you don't need this this is a dedicated terminal these are for people who do not have a pc at home at this right moment just now you were saying if i use a modem it's slower if i use what then it's faster it's a rf card r there there's an rf card c4: in here o: all built in all built in you see this is a o: the modem simple o: ya the modem and the receiver card are all built in into this dedicated terminal swan tah is the planning engineer so if i use a computer it will be slower nope computer with the rf card you want to see how fast it is where's the rf card the rf card with a twelve hundred mode uh with a modem is two hundred and thirty five dollars o: it's a good offer buy you try to get a modem outside it's a few hundred dollars worth okay so it's only two hundred and thirty five dollars and what we do is for a small installation now most all computers unless you go through our uh distributors we've ran out the list of our distributors now we're selling it like hot cakes word okay unless you go to uh some of our distributors where they they they they have the rf vision word  but for us all you do is this for two hundred and thirty five dollars you get this price for a small amount we'll we'll have someone sent down and install the rf card for you we will inform you mrs quek now sign the thing and two weeks we'll either a week and a half or two weeks we'll give you an id come downto get the the the software you need a software all you do is software and we'll do the rest for you you subscribe now assistance for a small amount now this thing is there is only a small amount it's a couple  word of investment it's an investment the fact that if you use this for your child you can use it for yourself telebanking you know the thing is when we retrieve the information word  you're always improving on the information on the services and whatever yes yes i must emphasize that and the price remain the same the price will remain the same nine dollars subscription we want to get singaporeans to be at the forefront of the information retrieval this information is catered to you it's integrated and that is the key thing about teleview information you you can get this information at the paper but the fact that you have to go through the paper look you may miss it but if you want something teleview word it's all in it even the news news reuters i mean the usual thing people will  word first come up to me and say 'oh i do not have time' i do not have time to do this i do not have time to watch tv i do not have time to read papers but precisely this is what we want to help you do save time so that you'll still have information at your tip of your finger are the news really news it is new i mean it may not be cnn okay but can i copy the information for into a... you have a printer yes o: you need hard copy but uh you will be but i cannot copy it copy into my computer hard disk or diskette or... o: only hard copy if we allow that everyone will pass one and then before we know it we're pressing ourselve(s out uh ya i mean only word  the planning engineer o: ya he is the you you talking of people who work on this thing and will make it as comprehensive as advanced as we possibly can now we have had uh questions from all over the world and they say that we are the best still we are the first and we're still one of the best uh the in terms of customer base we're we're very large c4: so who are the people who pay you all word extra we use you see of the... yes we will send you we have schools that you can go to your fee word or you just go word for we will inform you on what to do any questions people at sales counter will  word to you word o: to access the information is very simple there are only there are three ways to access the information first we go through the we go by uh indexing see this is our main index so you just key in the number accordingly for example if you want uh the news eleven okay from here another index so you go by this way okay this is our first method the second method is uh the key word for example if you want to stock exchange say uh pcs share see here we are or you remember the page number okay for example sia seven four seven 747 very easy very user-friendly the as i said the advantage is the fact that you miss this information if you retrieve it on the paper the fact that you go round hunting for it you you waste time hunting for it c4: the information for that day the word paper you find that you want to check through last week newspaper or last month newspaper where are you going to  word  oh then you would have to go to archives to c4: but now the information is for today it's the latest i mean if let's say let's say news without word  o: news that's why it's called news ya you you let's let's news means current c4: but i miss the newspaper so i want to retrieve uh last week's news ya c4: so is it possible can then we oh maybe i heard someone said 'oh last week did you read this news about this ' i didn't can i c4: ah i didn't read newspaper ya o: uh no no o: news is always uh the most updated c4: the updated o: yes ya o: but then four-d 4-d and toto result can i don't want to say that so let's say tonight the nine o'clock news okay i will have to say news as it's being word right nine very likely now the thing is this information is provided by singapore press holding(s singapore these are the people who work for straits time(s they commit themselve(s to putting upto-date information o: singapore telecom(s is the network operator ya o: so information are provided by the service provider we we are the conduit you know we word  have the customer and then we have the service providers c4: so we are the ones supposed to correct we provide the system we support the system o: but right now all our service provider they are very dedicated they update their information very frequently they see this as a another c4: so we go through uh actually print out in whatever word o: ids word  into the printer and you can print your we have a lot of services that are actually on-line singapore stock exchange flight information uh inland revenue cpf um government tender c4: cpf that means to say we can actually check our account o: yes you want to check now on-line o: you want to check now and also bank the four uh the big four local bank posb and two commercial bank see word who are the banks o: banking okay one method by keywords i find that when you type the it's quite slow you see o: um because um i typed slowly no no no sorry the letter didn't appear fast o: oh you know why because this information is actually sent to the central system and echo back if you are if you have if you have experience working with uh mainframe muh it's precisely the same same situation it will never never be instantaneous o: ya the thing is you you know standardize actual fact  word uh it's fast considering o: yes it's very fast o: you know where is it our system located orchard road our comcentre the word actually goes there and come back 
Singapore	okay this this one is the living assurance policy and uhm what i will advice is that you top up thirty-five to uh fifty thousand alright the first column show you the total premium you pay over the year uh second column is the cash value alright cash value means that anytime you want to terminate your policy you can take back the cash money you can get back ya you terminate the policy ya if you terminate the policy this is the amount of money you can get back alright uh death benefit of course uhm it means the twenty-six illnesses uh it's covering as well as in time of death or total and permanent disability then you are quite clear about the type of policy we're having right paid up i forget paid up is the one uh okay let's say say for example number ten year okay i i stop payment or the premium and this and i let the policy goes on so this is the uh uh coverage isn't it okay paid up means that okay at any time uh any one year if you want to stop paying alright if you get that in cash it's going to be very much less than what you're going to get alright so if you opt for pay up means that you know the policy will still run lah it will still down anytime down the years let's say ten years later if you opt for a pay up at tenth time even is uh twenty years down the road it will still pay you that particular value ya for example if let's say at the tenth year you opt for pay up which is eleven thousand so another ten years down the road okay you will only they will only eleven thousand if something happen to you if something happen ya i mean of course here it means uhm it means in terms of the twenty-six sicknesses or in time or death and total and disability four o six such a small policy that's because uhm uhm uh top it up for your last twenty-five thousand i didn't know that last time i bought so such a small policy oh yes i am trying to ask you to buy a bigger policy you say no no no such a small policy fifteen thousand so should i keep increase to what fifty thousand fifty thousand are you sure but i don't want to i i don't want to spend so much money alright normally for uhm for any insurance policy what you should consider is that uhm you can either pay uh about fifteen per cent of your annual salary alright the total premium should be about fifteen per cent of your annual salary that is a lot isn't it uhm alamak fifteen is a lot of money well it's uh money from the left hand pocket to the right hand pocket you still get back every cent eventually it's a lot of money and i say you you still get back every cent eventually alright so as i said it's either fifteen per cent of your annual salary or uhm it's uh six times your annual salary the total amount you should return six times six to seven times your annual salary depending on the age six times ya it's also a lot then you are under insured i have how much let's see how much i have maybe perhaps talking about six times i have maybe only uh how much am i insured how much are you insured less than two hundred thousand no uh no okay when i talk about six seven time your annual salary alright it also cover your term policy alright it will cover uhm the amount which your company is buying for you it doesn't means that everything is out of your pocket okay and uh normally as a person grow older the amount uhm insured over the annual salary can be less for example if you are in your forties then the amount which can be five times your annual salary because by then your income would have increased so it cannot be six seven times in at that fifteen thousand for four hundred dollars this is very little right ya expensive no it's not kim wan one how much uh i forgot four hundred plus also ya but kim wan age is uhm that one is without loading uh that is without loading but of course i'm giving her the standard right but actually when it comes back to us i think probably does she need to go through another policy uh uh uh medical check up i doubt so because it's only in the matter of one year so not necessary ya but as i say i can't say anything in this present moment if the underwriter need her to go for a medical check check-up she has to also alright why underwriter so cautious well uhm the risk is there you see and uh that type of medication which she is taking is still basically the same so i'm not very sure whether they still need uhm to uh for her to go for another check-up your this uh so-called concession what or offer period or concession rate until end of this year it's just no it's up to thirtieth of november but of course uh don't wait until the last minute because uh it may be some complication who knows you think something like telecoms rush ya ya ya you'd be surprised you know no lah what telecoms rush you won't have another telecoms rush no what i mean of course not but what i'm trying to say is that okay give us two weeks you know because maybe you need a medical check-up you know i need a medical check-up don't be too sure don't be too sure i am very sure i am very sure actually not bad uh medical check-up free medical check-up i want to go for medical check-up i talked about it for years no action so you want a free medical check-up free right ya but can refer one right but they only charge you on your blood sorry on your blood and urine that's right not i went for blood test cholesterol don't know what it's because of the you know the i want to go on the acu test the acu test so you need a blood test so coming back to this policy maybe i should refresh your memory later alright uh for example let's look at uhm fifty-five if you decide to stop paying and if something happen uh ten years down the road okay they're still be paying you the new uhm aye how come benefit minus the ten years without uh minus the ten years premium it's it's different from paying up uh it's different ya that must be after paying back normally people will opt for it only after a few years because it make no sense you see for example if if if you pay for about fifteen years or so this policy can actually run until you're in eighties and i think it's worth while considering because you are only covered medically until fifty-five until sixty fifty-five or sixty after that you're not cover uhm by any medical insurance this one is sixty uh no those who are sixty-five no no no i show the figure fifty-five sixty sixty-five because this is the time when people stop paying you see because when you retire as long as this policy you don't terminate it will continue you know so up to your eighties even in your nineties but you it only covers up to sixty-five what or something no no no no fifty-five something like that isn't it you're wrong no no you're wrong no no no i thought the policy was was was uh okay this policy technically alright technically alright will be you have to pay up to eight well you have to pay up to eighty-seven years alright that means if you continue paying when the person is eighty-eight alright that's when the policy become free but normally people won't pay for such a long period so normally people pay for fifteen years or they pay until they are fifty-five sixty or sixty-five then you stop paying alright and the policy will be able to run on so let's say if you stop paying at fifty-five or sixty right if something happen to you at seventy years old they will still pay you so it is actually uhm quite sometimes it's after uh all along i thought this policy were only cover up to what sixty-five years old or fifty-five years old or something like that no no it used to be like that isn't it it was never use to be like that i think you got it wrong right from the start no i thought so no i remember it it was no as i was explaining for example okay uhm if you stop paying at fifty-five okay the coverage is forty-three right now at sixty-five if something happen to you okay they will pay you sixty-nine minus the ten year premium plus interest uhm so isn't that very attractive what so attracting what what do you mean by not so attractive because you already stop paying they're giving you the new coverage minus the ten year premium plus uh it's attractive if it's free and if it's attractive is free nothing is for free uhm nothing is for free ya to break-even so it takes so long to break-even fifteen years uhm break-even is about uh fourteen fifteen years takes so long uhm whether it's long or short it's relative actually i can go and buy a what and tick or this one cannot be as a rider right you told me before i bought it can be as a rider but a rider will stop at sixty in that sense you are right you buy a rider you will stop covering you at sixty and for a rider there is no bonus included alright that means if something happens to you let's say if you buy a thirty thousand rider attach to a policy it's cheaper right it's much cheaper but if let's say nothing happen you won't get a single cent and if something happen you'll only get but the main policy the main policy uh it's income generally ya the basic policy there is bonus so as you see the figure actually increase for example you look at the cash value uh on return here is a very small amount but as you go along you know the amount increase is it cheaper if i go in that way i i do it that way that i buy another like some other policy then i take this as a rider is it more more i think it's not advisable why because this policy how come i don't have a convertible rider because you never buy a rider but does that really matter you see it's still at the same rate whether i i get the rider or not ya but presumably let's say if you are medically unfit right now if you have a rider then the company have not right to reject you you get what i'm trying to say ah ha alright so the other about this policy is that now if you take it as a rider now this policy or rather the rider will stop paying when you are sixty and the two particular disease which you have alzheimer and parkinson and that basically attack a person in their old age and a lot of this problem actually you know uh appears when the person is old and it doesn't make sense you know that you buy this policy to protect you right now but when it come to your old age there's nothing to protect you

much for john hancock's standing let us get back to you raymond tell me more about yourself are you married yes i am married oh good do you have any kids ah yah currently one boy uhm one boy ah uh your wife is working yes she is oh as what as a secretary as a secretary okay oh what about yourself what do you do i am a software engineer software engineer wow that is engineering isn't it i t you must be busy with the y2 bug and the ever changing i t technology these days yeah got to catch up with them laughs  share with me your knowledge of insurance raymond what do you know uh uh and what you may not know or understand what do you have at the moment too at the moment i have a small n t u c income policy uhm uh but i don't really know much about insurance uh because that time i got it uh just because the n t u c income agent came down to our uh army camp oh i see okay you may be wondering why i ask you so many questions the reason is to know what actually you want and what actually you need oh yes just to confirm what you have shared you are 27 years old right yes you are married and you have a six month old baby boy you have an insurance programme when you were 18 years old from n t u c when you were in the army and a small protection of fifteen thousand dollars whole life plan yes yes so what made you to consider to have more insurances now well uhm ah basically i am earning much more now and uh besides i see a lot of people around me suffering from critical illnesses that really cost a bomb to the family and uh in the end it will leave the family in the lurch when they die so uhm at this moment i wish to save more as well as to provide more protection for my family sake ok so you feel that you are older now earning a higher income you and you have a family now and also you wish to have the savings as well as protection for your family right yah okay now besides that what other things do you have in mind you must have beard from other companies or from your friends the company's products no ah not much so far as a matter of fact i didn't bother about it initially so i don't really have a grasp of what insurance can offer me oh i see okay now in this case since you shared with me that you do not really have a grasp of what's available or for the matter what kind of insurance there are i will start with you some basic understanding of insurance insurance is basically savings put in a certain institution called insurance company that will give you a higher amount of money back when the policy matures or where the company will take uh undertake for you certain responsibilities when you die permanently and totally disabled or when you are diagnosed of a certain critical illness there are basically 3 kinds of insurannce namely 1 term plan 2 endowment and 3 whole life plans term plans generally gives you a high coverage for death or permanent disability with no returns that is there will not be any money in return if nothing happens to you it's like renting a flat where you don't own it once you leave yu have to return it to the owner endowment plans gives you a certain amount of money at a certain period say after 20 years you will need to put aside a generally higher premium for this plan it also covers you for only death and permanent disability only you can add riders like hospitalisation benefits or critical illnesses coverage etc to this basic plan whole life is somewhat different it covers you for life at a much lower premium due to death permanent disability as well as upon diagnosis of critical illness okay am i going too fast for you raymond ah no so far so good okay good i'm glad that you understand so far and ah just to reinstate i understand that you wish to protect yourself against illnesses death and to do a little savings for your old age as well as for your little prince's education right may i ask what is your budget for yourself and for your son ah well i think for myself it will be around the range of $250 and ah my uh i mean for your son for myself 250 and for my son probably a hundred okay now uhm as a professional in this field i always feel it is important to look into the welfare for our family those who are still around when we are gone i am happy to know raymond that you thought likewise let me print this out for you okay i'm proposing to you this plan that pays you a hundred thousand if premature death were to occur to you right now or when you are unfortunate to be diagnosed of any of the 30 illnesses in this case you will also receive a paid lump sum of 20 per cent to the sum assured on the first year and subsequently the remaining 80 per cent on the second year when you are totally and permanently disabled after that you will be paid a yearly amount of fifty thousand till you are age 65 wow does this sounds good the beauty of this plan is that you need to only pay for 20 years after which the plan will automatically grow on its own earning bonuses as it goes along moreover with these two plans with this plan your two kids including your future child will be given free critical illnesses coverage of ten thousand each if they are diagnosed of the illnesses they must be between the age of thirty days old to eighteen years old ain't that good what do you think of this plan it seems so interesting ah i mean what john hancock can offer you mean that any of my child is diagnosed for any of the 30 illnesses i'm able to claim ten thousand from john hancock yeah yeah so what happen to my policy then your policy still carries on till you either cancel it or till there is a claim made so you mean i can like take out some money after 20 years yeah you can you can cash it out but i have a better idea you don't cash it out but instead you take a loan carry on with the giro deduction and you are still under cover by john hancock you need not pay back till you have the money if anything does happen to you or you wish to surrender it later the amount at that point of time would always be higher than what you borrowed there are lots of ideas that i can share with you that can benefit you and your family while you save with john hancock that sure is interesting and what about my son's plan then now uhm he'll be going to the army when he's 20 about 18 years old and he'll be in the university when he's 21 years old so it's about 20 years from now now i've worked out this plan whereby you can take out a sum about forty thousand when he's 21 years old and moreover for this kind of plan children's plan if anything does happen to you or your wife be it in terms of death permanent disability or diagnosis of illnesses the premium will be totally waived meaning you don't have to pay anymore john hancock will take the responsibility of paying the premium you just pay for the time to come when he's 21 years old and you can take out the money oh there is something now whereby even if my wife is diagnosed of illness or what you call death of disability i don't need to pay anymore oh yah yah so uhm in fact what you share with me so far i think  car honking  uhm well basically will meet my needs and my family well ah looks like john hancock do provide some good products i think ah i like to sign up ah for such a plan  rustling of papers  well i'm glad that uhm you wish to do that but just to reinstate do you understand so far what i've shared what i shown to you and illustrated to you well ah so far uhm yes ok raymond so can i have your ic so that we can start the process of filling in the forms and uhm make the payment too uhm okay no problem here is my ic uhm all right thank you well raymond i'm very happy for you do you know that you've actually put your family first by getting these plans just to recap what you've signed up you've got for yourself a plan that protects you a minimum of a hundred thousand if you faced premature death or upon diagnosis of any of the 30 critical illnesses and if you are totally and permanently disabled to receive 20 per cent of the sum assured that is twenty thousand for the first year and subsequently the remaining eighty thousand on the second year you will also be receiving an additional twenty thousand till the age of sixty five moreover any two children will be covered for ten thousand upon diagnosis of any of the critical illnesses as for your son you will receive at least forty thousand after 20 years even if you or your wife is not around or when you are diagnosed of any critical illnesses or if you are totally or permanently disabled be proud of yourself raymond 
Singapore	hello mr lim hi uh mr tan how are you fine thank you wah been quite a while that i have last since the last time i come up to your visit looks like you are doing pretty well oh not not not too well actually my business has been pretty bad oh is it because of the economic down turn and uh some cash flow problem also oh is it but uh i uh i thought the when i uh i was driving in just now, i saw that you have actually extended your back end of your factory into a double storey and then i saw i think you have put in a few line lines of machine i thought you were doing pretty well uhm i it was more for the long term but uh right now is running into difficulties because of all these extension oh i see in that case you maybe you have expanded uh uh over expanded lah over the last last last two three years maybe a bit too fast lah i see i see well anyway this is not the you are not the only customer in fact i was just visiting two other customers yesterday at the somewhere around here jurong and uh ya everybody looks like they have some problem here and there especially with this economic crisis right ya what what do you see of indonesia do you think indonesia would be a would be of any help if they of any help to business or not if they really win over the elections and a more stable government is uh in place uh i think it is going to take time lah with all the violence going around there i i think is going even when a stable government is uh elected i think it's still going to take years lah well very sad man i mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us jittery man anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you today actually uh uh we just want to come up to update with you uh as in our all annual exercises lah to to update with you how is business and then we will also want to discuss a little regarding your credit facilities i think you have known uh if you have read the papers uh over the past few months uh in fact the local banks uh we are actually quite heavy laden with the with non-performing loans so sad to say but uh because of all these we are actually uh forced in certain ways to re-look into all the credit facilities granted to our customers so i think that is basically my objection my my objective today right uhm uhm all right mr lim ya so actually i was uh in fact my colleague samuel the other day have spoken to your secretary uh we are actually looking into to discuss with you the possibility of reducing your current uh o d line with us currently you have one million so we are actually looking at reducing the line to eight hundred thousand i know it is a bit difficult but uh wa still have to reduce some more ya have to reduce ah so i know it is a bit difficult given the uh i mean just now like what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have to come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the intention that the bank is adopting but but my business is already so bad and i really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my o d line some more i just don't know lah i really don't know uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that mr tan you could understand the position we are in lah although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella but i hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly hit ah property value have all drop and all that in fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all underwater we are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your o d has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually went over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a restructure we are not trying to say we want to bring it back down to two hundred lah you know within twenty-four hours we are looking at a maybe a restructured payment say maybe five thousand per month something like that something that you are comfortable with hor and then at least uh you know we could use this as a tool and then to tie tide over this period of time for all you know five thousand you know a month over over one year we are looking at only sixty thousand so we try to use it as a tool to buy time on your end as well as on the bank's end then hopefully that when the market recovers and then you know we could reinstate back the line in fact we have been doing this for some of our customers so you can be rest assured you know we are not a wet weather bank but uh we are here to do something that is beneficial on both ends huh i hope i hope this is a simple proposition that i can lay it before you uhm sounds all right to me but but maybe i didn't say very strongly that i really have serious cash flow problem and then i really expanded a bit too fast, so that is being cutting into my uh cash and businesses and facilities too i see maybe it is because of your investment in china i understand last year we actually granted you the additional o d and it was actually meant for some overseas investment in china i understand it was something like shanghai how is the development there or is it the other side is actually sucking up all the money actually to tell you the truth ya it is sucking quite a lot of my cash oh dear i see from here i see so if that is the case then i would suggest is that uh but coming back to the point again it is five i mean it is like what i said we are not looking at two hundred thousand although this is uh you know the initial idea that head office has imposed on your account but i am looking at a maybe on gradual basis what about five thousand per month do you think you can manage with that for the time being so every month we reduce by five thousand lah so over a period of one year we are looking at sixty thousand because if that is ok then maybe again i cannot promise you this is this is only uh a decision on my end here it may be approved it may not be approved but i want to have i want to work out something that is more comfortable so long as you are comfortable i think that is more important at the end of the day you don't over commit yourself to the bank and then if you are something that you are comfortable you can fulfil i think that is more important right i understand that uhm five thousand sounds ok but i may have to like retrench some of my workers wah in that case sounds quite bad if it is five thousand but i think this is the best that i can do this is the best that i can do so uh anyway we will also take into consideration of the long relationship that you have with us having bank with us for over the last twenty years beginning with your father's time so i ya ya i will also take in consideration of the possibility of you know even if you have to retrench some of your staff if you go on a o d reduction anyway i will try my very best mr tan what i do is that i will write a short report and then we give it to we see whether we can come back to you say within a week's time that sounds fine within a week's time and then we see how we go from there if really you have any problem then what we do is that after six months okay we will come back to you again and well we can sit down and then discuss further then i mean let us hope that the economy will recover by then because right now the biggest problem that we have is that we actually uh sitting on a lot of properties like for example these factories that you have now uh last year when i came in it was something like three point five million and then today we are looking at two million so straightaway we are looking at a negative network of about one point five million so this is the biggest headache that we are facing so i think not a problem lah don't worry i mean i will come to you in say one week's time and then we see how we go from there what about your bank you said your bank is also affected oh banks we are affected we are affected uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly hit we are badly hit so you know we are not spared lah okay we are not spared lah uhm nice to know that i am not alone in all this you are not spared okay we are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but we have to be prudent huh like living in singapore we have to be prudent we have to again uh we have to protect the interest of our share-holders, depositors and all that lah but uh well never mind we see how it will it goes more important i think we want to see that we can help our local enterprise here to ride through this bad times which is the reason why i have said we are always open for discussion although the intention is to reduce your od limit by two hundred thousand but i think we can always look into a restructured payment five thousand if it is too difficult for you we try it for six months after six months if you really have problems come back to us ok our doors are open anytime my phone is also always there uh you can call me and then we can have a discussion i mean the last thing that we want to do is to force you into liquidity problem all right thanks okay thanks mr tan uh we will not have lunch this time maybe uh when i come back with you i will come back to you on the good news the next week we can have lunch together yes that would be fine thanks a lot ya thanks a lot bye bye okay bye 
Singapore	 date: 13 april 1999 place conference room topic management meeting think this is the first time we have two generations in the same meeting uh we won't wait for uh sheila so we can get started i think tan knows why uh he is here to capture the english used not the chinese used uhm i must say first i will have to leave by one forty-five so i am going to run through a little bit faster then maybe some of you anything you all want to discuss together as a group uh first of all the sports can i leave you to look after that after i have left uh a number of things that come up uh over the past week huh first of all the ranking of uh teachers huh i there is a new set of forms sar forms that come out staff appraisal report forms uhm they are usual the usual thing are three types of forms is the uh the performance report word appraisal that's the potential and the third one is the work review same thing but all three are all three have been revamped right uh to me it looks more difficult but according to ministry it says it's simpler maybe it is because we are not familiar with the pattern format uhm but for this year just to let you know the ministry is changing the schedule somewhat all right in the past years the uh the sar forms everything word  at the end of the year and last year in february they asked us for the potential forms they said the performance forms was only to be included teachers whose performance grade is d or below so we only had two forms last year uh this year they have asked for the uh potential form to be done in may right the performance form if is if at all is need to be done but they have not decided but if it should to be done it will be done at the end of the year so performance form will come at the end of the year potential will be done at the end of may and the schedule will be out i will give you the detailed schedule at a nearer date but just basically uh to let you know ahead of time so that it won't come as a big shock we need we need to do uh the teachers' ranking together with the remember we had a teachers' ranking session together with the uh inspectors yes you remember uh last year i can't remember when we did it but it was definitely towards the end of the latter part of the year all right now this year the performance ranking will be done uh quite early let me just check my schedule for this year performance ranking i slotted the date for our school we will be doing the ranking together with brenda on the twentieth of may so you may like to jot down the date on your diary twentieth of may right it will probably start at two o'clock i will confirm this and the exact time later on so twentieth may which means to say that uh we will have to have our pre-ranking done very much earlier now ministry is supposed to have already sent me the pre-ranking form by yesterday i have not seen any anything yet uh it could be with the courier service not arrive yet but uh the once it comes in and i get everything sorted out i will get this to you as quickly as as earliest possible so that you got time to word  my guess either i look at it because there is there is not the usual twelve month gap between one ranking and the next the potential can't be changed very much all right so uh i did bring this up to the ministry that if we rank potential then end of the year we rank uh performance 'cause performance is something else because a teacher's performance can change quite drastically over one year period but i uh agree with them that the performance no the potential ranking cannot changed very much especially since the lapse is about half a year only so uh i don't know whether you word but you probably did quite okay with that unless word  twentieth may is for potential right potential you call us to uh potential ranking potential ranking we are only going to potential ranking performance ranking will be end of the year if uh it may not come with the form but the potential performance ranking definitely will be done at the end of the year all right my uh the point that i brought up to the ministry is that there will be some difficulty since this is the first time we are doing performance and potential quite far apart because uh remember we said that uh for an officer to be to be ranked uh to be given a grade of sorry to be to be ranked on potential or given a potential of two grades higher let's say a teacher was given a uh grade p6b for instance from p grade to p6b cause p7 is hod or sh lh p6b is vp right ok so if a teacher is given a potential grade of p6b from p8 it's two grades higher two grades higher the performance grade must be at least a b all right remember c is one grade up b is two grades up but now now that we are doing potential now and performance end of the year there may be cases of contradiction all right so uh this is to be word in mind when we do the ranking all right but uh we will do our pre-ranking this month later part of this month and then we try to do our internal ranking together uh of course inter-departmental ranking early next month in time for brenda to come and do final ranking with us on the twentieth all right the rational behind this maybe i just point out the rational behind this ministry is now thinking of doing appointments some time in the middle of the year all right so if there should be any hods appointed vps or vps appointed principals and so on their appointments for promotions and so on will become uh in this instance closer to the promotion date promotion date is now fixed as first of april so appointments will be some time in june july as well so that's why we are doing this otherwise unlike in the past all the appointments come quite late at the end of the year they are also trying to change appointments of all other appointees other than the principals somewhere in the course of the year probably closer to the end of the year because if there is a lot of new appointments at the end of the year then it can cause a lot of disruption to the whole system all right so whether that's good system or not i think that is debatable but this is what they are going for all right so uh cross ranking i have given you the date sorry ranking i have given you the date twentieth of uh mr sim there will be another promotion exercise towards the later part no from now on there is only one promotion exercise but uh over yesterday's news they said that there is another promotion exercise no i think they are talking about appointments word i think it is not to be mixed up appointments with promotions from now on the appointments uh promotions will only be once a year okay uh that's done now cluster activities i have not asked you about this but uh in the email to me some time last month uh we have been asked whether we would like to take up cluster activities another words rather than organise things on our own we work as a cluster word  we save on organisational uh effort and also on cost all right so at the moment two uh three items have crop up uh two concerning uh one concerning pupils and two concerning teachers i just list it out and then you note it down and see whether you want to have this uh if you want to have this for your pupils then we will you let me know so that we can i can book this with them all right one is pupil student leadership student leadership actually charlton has got a consultant and this consultant is actually coming to see me tomorrow morning all right uh they are running a course two and a half day stay-in course on student leadership all right and uh the cost is not a big problem i think cost because we group together the cost per head will be less all right and uh at the moment we have uh fixed the date as twenty-fourth to twenty-sixth of june towards the latter part of the june holidays twenty-fourth to twenty-sixth is actually a thursday to saturday so two and a half days and saturday being a half day all right and they have also allocated a also arranged for the venue to be ai tong school ai tong has got a quite large uh compound so we are using ai tong because it also got a lot of special rooms including the threatrette that can seat two hundred people word  will it involve p6 pupils uh we have checked that we will be remaining open but most of us felt that it should be p5 because p5 pupils june quite close to streaming exam ah that's right p5 exam so i think the target should be p5 p4 and p6 are out simply because it's too close to the exam so it would be p5 pupils all right so this is one the other one is uh there was a course conducted by ministry of health on voice are for teachers i think you all familiar with this kind of picture uh some of our teachers applied separate uh initially a lot of the chinese teachers went through it and it was quite good they found it helps uh we are asking whether the ministry of health the consultants can hold a course for our cluster because some of our teachers applied then turned down all right and they told us that they are willing to conduct for a three hour session for one thousand dollars all right now teachers applied i think will have to pay uh twenty-five twenty i think it's ten dollars how much is that twenty twenty dollars per head so that means they are working on fifty people is it all right uh they are telling us that uh one thousand dollars per session they are not bothered about how many people we can have one thousand people then is one dollar each so uh it just a session for them and we thought this would benefit us as a cluster at the moment we have uh we said that you open up to all the cluster schools and if we have five hundred people each one pays only two dollars but we will probably arrange at a venue that is a bit more conducive rather than the school so at the moment two venues have cropped up one is either serangoon country club or the grassroot club at ang mo kio all right they have got quite nice facilities and probably word  if it's held in the afternoon then high tea all right uh all through me so this uh we have fixed the date as twenty-fifth june right the last friday of the school holidays so we will publicise this to our teachers and find out how many are interested uh can you can you like so i will ask nancy to publicise this 
Singapore	 property agent and client thurs 18/3/99  good morning mr bek i'm glad that you are able to make it have a seat mr bek you said that you were recommended by teo yes my friend teo was impressed by your ability to market his house at such a good price as well and also so quickly too when he knew that i wish to sell my house he quickly called me to contact you that's nice of him thank you i would be most glad to help you market your house so i believe that you are looking for a house oh yes i need you to get one for me okay let me tell you more of my house the house i am staying now is a 5 i unit in tampines it's just passed five years i bought it for one hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars i wish to downgrade to a 4a or 4i unit in tampines can you please give me some advice so as to what i should do etc sure basically the guidelines towards purchasing a resale flat in the open market is quite simple since you have a house it is easier at least on your finance before you get a loan from hdb they would want to use up all your cpf funds in the ordinary account before they lend to you so we have to check whether you have the sufficient twenty percent deposit required when you purchased the house as well as your income to determine the amount of loan available allowable for you oh is your wife going to be the co-owner that is she is sharing in the payment of the house yes my wife will be my co-owner and will be sharing in paying for the house we have a combined cpf of about eighty thousand dollars in our ordinary account okay a 4a or 4i would fetch about two hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred and eighty thousand depending on the location the level whether it is at lift landing or not is it facing western/eastern sun etc quite a number of factors will be involved in the pricing of the flat not forgetting the renovation done to the house so your eighty thousand dollars would easily cover the deposit of between fifty thousand to sixty thousand and also the stamp fees etc how much are both of you earning now as for myself my gross salary is two thousand five hundred a month and my wife's is about one thousand eight hundred a month and how much did you have to pay for your present five-room and how much have both of you paid so far our present house cost us one hundred and seven-three thousand and we have paid so far about eight-six thousand dollars how much can my house fetch now is it somewhere three hundred and fifty thousand yeah the market is about this amount we have to call for valuation first after which we can decide to advertise the amount we wish to sell but before that we should look out for your new house first in this way you can be assured of sufficient time to renovate your new place to move in just in time for you to hand the keys of your five-room flat to the new owner all the process will take four months approximately but i will need a total of six months to look for a house for you as well as marketing your five-room as for commission we charge a one per cent commission for helping you to buy a flat and two per cent for selling your flat if you agree on the terms spelt out can you please sign us an exclusive for marketing your house what do you think mr bek i think that is fine with me what do you need my ic yes thank you  okay ming chuan lim ming chuan still under medical

Singapore	 date 29 march 1999 place: shop  hi hello hello uhm what can i help you uhm i am actually browsing lah because i am uhm looking for some some toys to start my own collection oh okay we have many toys here okay so you got to decide what you are really interested in uhm i am more interested into star wars star wars all right ah you have picked a very very difficult collection to start with yes i know but let me introduce myself first my name is tow yi hello i am christine christine all right okay so what why are you interested in star wars star wars probably i am because probably because of the uhm movies uhm i am quite fascinated by the you know the costumes and stuff like that ah ya i agree with you too and the story line too bad it is quite ya very exciting the things about good versus evil light versus dark ya ya ya ya ya it is fantastic it is just very very good aren't you excited about the new movie coming out ya ya ya ya i heard that the date that it will be shown in singapore is june the third ya i heard about it before and the trailers are already running in some of the cinemas and it is very very good i have not seen it yet haven't seen it yet you better you must check it out it is very very good i just heard it from my friends and it is good you know ya ya you know what is the story about this this a lot of people has been asking what is the story about uh not very sure actually you know about star wars right ya star wars the trilogy is actually the forth part of the story that george lucas thought of so empire strikes back is the fifth and return of the jedi is actually the sixth now he is going back to explain the story of how uhm uhm the dark the evil forces came about rebellion came about and how how a small little boy called anakin skywalker becomes darth vader i see should be interesting ya very grand ya very grand a lot of there is a lot a lot being written about it and uhm can't wait just can't wait now let us go into the toys so so it is such a big collection to start with and star wars toys have been around for so many years vehicles figurines play sets and things like that so uhm you have decide where to start with you cannot start i don't think you want to buy everything because it would be a fortune no i cannot afford so probably i would start uhm with the newer ones ha the newer ones ha yes but the newer ones uhm uhm actually it has been around for some time also yes i know ya it also cost quite a lot and because you started so late and a lot of the figures that you may want would be very very difficult to find i will just get those by which you can find first and the rest i will think later and depending on the price also oh yes so how much are you selling yours uhm i always like new collectors to start their new collection and i always wish them to carry on because it is such uh uh to me it is a very nice hobby i have been doing this for so many years so i will give you a very reasonable price very reasonable believe me you will okay we will talk about the price later but let us not talk about that maybe we talk about the figures and things like that so the thing about the figures is it is very small but somebody like to start with the dolls the twelve inch dolls i have a few here i can show you like this is princess leia all white and things like that no i think i prefer the smaller ones the smaller ones ha yes which is more expensive ya but maybe i suggest this the thing to start with maybe a theme a what start with a theme okay for some people it would be too much for them to start with they like to start with a certain scenario like uhm uhm certain guys i know they like the bounty hunters a lot they appear in you know in the empire strikes back if i am not wrong i think is boba fett boba fett and uh a lot of other characters also bousk and things like that so what i suggest one way you can do is go about doing this is uhm you can actually get the bounty hunters first set that scene you know set your scene because that is your favourite scene ya ya in fact i like them ya what else i know some of the girls believe me girls also come to my shop to buy toys and things not for their husbands or their boy friends but for themselves so when you come in i am not surprised ya some of my friends do that too ya ya it is nice uhm uhm some of the girls they like return of the jedi especially the cute little guys the ewoks ya ya you know about that right i saw the cartoons so what these what they do is that buy all the ewoks and they create a scene all from there and i have a special special play set over here called the ewok village that i import from the states and it is not it will not be made it has not been made it has stopped manufacturing ewok village for a long long time but i get in through them quite quite all right about fifty dollars for how many it just that ewok village with all the play sets let me show you let me show you okay it should be interesting ya like you see the net here the fireplace you know all the place they stay in and you got traps here and things like that catapults you know the place where they place the catapults the tree trunks and things like that so you can get all the ewoks and put on it and you can get your own little scenario is nice ya and they and they kenner has made things that are very unusual lah you know there is that like this is a combat glider you know the part that you see in return of the jedi where ewok was on a glider and he threw stones on the chicken walkers and there are so many other things so that is one way you can start with i see ya ya or another way is that you go with your favourite characters what are the characters in star wars movies that you really like i have a friend a lady friend who likes princess leia a lot ya ya and she comes in different uhm different uniforms and clothes and dresses and things like that so what she does is that she only buys the princess leias all different things or she buys the twelve dolls she buys all the figures with princess leia so she sticks with this i think it cost quite a lot right if i am not wrong no if you go by theme in this way if you go by a certain scenario in this way it cost much less i see rather than to start from scratch and you buy everything there is and you can't even find some of the things and i tell you some of the things uhm they don't make now and they are very very expensive like i have here maybe this particular luke skywalker with the long sabre ya when they first made it they made the long sabre and it is not proportional with the with the size of the figures ya i heard about it ya ya so if you want to get back all these collectors' item they are very difficult to find but in another way if you are not particular about this they're made this using short light sabre and uhm they don't cost a bomb they cost about ten bucks each i see easily manageable so you have to decide where where you want to start with i see okay what about aliens uh oh aliens okay i know about aliens a lot because uh believe it or not i didn't start with star wars when i started collection i actually started with aliens i see i like the shows a lot you know ya the movies are great right ya but i know the toys are very rare now you cannot get it anywhere oh ya very difficult to get do you sell them by the way i do i do i do sell them and sometimes on and off i try to locate them from overseas and i try to bring them in to singapore because there's still a lot of collectors are there who are very keen on aliens stuff ya ya ya i like the show very much ya i love it too and incidentally that's how i started toy collection from aliens from aliens ya so so we have talked a lot so are you going to get today or do you want to wait another day to get uhm probably another day lah another day i have to think about what i really want correct so thing remember to me toys you know always bring people together that to me is the important thing about toys so that is nice ya don't be too interested in the values uhm the you know the market price of the toy and things like that it take away the joy out of it get it get something that you really like something that reminds you of the good old days bring back memories or something that you really like in a movie like star wars scenes and things like that get those get things that are closer to your heart okay instead of getting things that people tell you to get because they are very good price because next time would fetch a good price next time would fetch a higher price no it is not that reason i like toys ya it's not fun at all ya don't do that like for me when i was young how i get into toys was this i don't have much money so my parents only very occasionally buy me one or two star wars toys and i play them and play them over and over again and i still have them and i keep them as memories and things like that and when i grew up i told myself that when i start to earn money again i would go back to collect the things the toys that i really really like so that's what toys mean are to me i see memories the good old days and things that i really like and it brings people together so remember this when you think about the toys okay ya thanks a lot nice talking to you is been very very fun ya it has been very fun talking about toys i don't normally get customers to come in here and i can talk about toys so much so so it is been very very fun here is my name card uhm call me anytime so we are open from nine eh no from twelve to about seven o'clock each day except monday because that is the day we rest and uhm uhm we try to hunt around for toys i see  so uhm if you need anything just call us we can reserve things for you or we can bring them from overseas remember i told you before also ah i also charge you a reasonable price okay so i will bring down my friend uhm uhm can i bring my friend along oh sure ya so probably a sunday lah okay that will be good are you open that day yes definitely okay ya i look forward to seeing you on that day again okay see you then bye thank you bye bye 
Singapore	rashid has uh until recently won five important titles including the sixth star malaysia open twice beating ah coincidence well beating team mate foo kok keong in both finals and he's strongly tipped to win this title tonight to make it with repeat of luck uh word over foo kok keong with three games four fifteen fifteen eleven fifteen five and uh kok keong narrowing things seven ten again kok keong part of the wrong foot unfortunately which i think had been pushed within too far on the far side uh to uh kok keong's left and he watched it as it he fell fell out of play and the he wins another point it's now two points uh he's two points behind at eight ten well rashid with one more of his cross court chops and uh foo kok keong scrambles for that one fell in the process uh and causing the his side of court to to be wet with his perspiration got it wiped and uh well he's a bit cross his court to rashid shidek ten eight a fine rally between these players and uh it is a very aggressive rashid shidek against the very game foo kok keong rashid using a lot of smashes and in many cases the leaping smash which is uh usually associated with the the players from indonesia and china well rashid is uh moving into very good effect but uh foo kok keong is returning almost everything that comes at him another one of those cross court chop by rashid this time it's a cross court chop by uh foo kok keong but uh a little too deep and it falls out of play and uh rashid moves on one point more eleven eight rashid is the top seed in this tournament of malaysia the number two seed bangbang supiato knocked out by foo kok keong in the quarter-final ponpamadi of indonesia the third seed knocked out by foo kok keong in the semi final ah that's that's good defending and that ends centre court returns and rashid he's fairly quick off the mark and he slams it down very hard and the he moves on to twelve twelve eight yuko suprianto another indonesian support seat who was ousted by rashid sidek in the semi-finals uh foo kok keong is the fifth to eighth seeds and then comes  word of thailand kim han kue of korean ang jay chiang of korea so now it's the first seat against the fifth to eighth seed in the final of this nineteen ninety-two seiko asian championship well rashid returns the favour has that ball floating quarter court and uh kok keong is under that one and he picked his spot and sent it down very firmly to win service eight twelve another beating smash from rashid's and taken by kok keong scrambling taking it that's the kind of player he is and his time is over unfortunately for the stroke's that he's returned is the most difficult one this was a breeze but he finally sent it into the net and the well the service crosses court now again and it's rashid sidek with service twelve points to eight three points away from this first game in the men's singles final one more point for rashid which makes it easier or does it he's two points away from this first game and uh he's probably wondering where that little extra comes from foo kok keong he's very quick his strive has gone beyond the reach of foo kok keong rashid sidek and now he's got one more point before he wins wraps up this first game at fourteen eight now serving to foo kok keong it's time the cross court keeping smash from rashid to kok keong's right falls out of play and service is in the hands of foo kok keong eight fourteen rashid fumbled the return and kok keong collects one more point it's nine fourteen and the you've probably be hear grunting reminiscent of the monica phyllis in ten tennis or the jimmy connors foo kok keong doing the grunting there every shot he attempts just  word service to rashid sidek fourteen nine will rashid wrap up this first game fourteen nine he does wrap it up rashid didn't realise but uh it probably falls out of court and so he wins his first game at fifteen nine rasid shidek winning the first game fifteen nine against foo kok keong in this men's singles final of the seiko asian badminton championship and uh well you can expect a lot more good badminton from these two players comes the second game in just a moment both sides of the court being mopped down because you can just imagine the perspiration from these two players the pace that they're playing at and uh looking at the two of them i would say that uh rashid is definitely the fitter of the two now what's going to happen in the second game now let's watch it love all rashid sidek serving to foo kok keong rashid is very quick on the return and uh here again he demonstrates that uh agility of his he returns that one very quickly and uh he beats kok keong and wins his first point in the second game one love rashid a loud call from the linesman calling the ball out two love rashid leading foo kok keong in the second game that was much too hard the fast court net return by foo kok keong falls out of court towards the umpire henry ee of singapore and uh rashid collects another point three love with that grunt according word smash by foo kok keong wins him service love three amazing how foo kok keong scrambles for the shot goes on all force and is eager to get up again to retrieve the next shot and here the rally in progress after that uh one attempt where he goes sprawling but getting to the shuttle and he wins his point here in after this long rally one three foo kok keong trading rashid sidek this time this time he's beaten similar situation he goes on all force again but doesn't reach the shuttle that chop again the deadly chop from rashid sidek beating him to kok keong's right and the service is over now to rashid sidek three one rashid on your cam on your screen now shuttle test both players happy with it and service now from rashid three one this is one of those shots that uh quite often work for foo kok keong the back end drop shot but uh in this instance it didn't quite work and the rashid moves along four one five one and the umpire was there right at that spot to see the shuttle fall out of play the return from foo kok keong five one very well executed overhead uh drop shot by foo kok keong and uh following the return by rashid uh cross court net return attempt by kok keong doesn't make it and uh rashid moves on to six six one foo kok keong winning this duel at the net and uh winning service over at one six he has to do something if he is going to make a fight of it in this second game he's five points behind here again another of his drop shot  word love love by the two players love again two players loving this is taking everything out of them stop shot by rashid again love kok keong up court shot but out of place and kok keong wins one more point six two two to kok keong and six to rashid sidek the topping would be the strokes that would take everything out of the two players again rashid making use of his height and that deadly uh cross court drop of his cross court chop uh to win that service and he's leading six two again we see kok keong stretching right down to retrieve the shuttle he gets it across and uh rashid makes the mistake of sending the shuttle out of lane and uh kok keong gets back service at two six and uh it's almost ten thirty-five in kuala lumpur as we witness the men's singles finals between the two malaysians rashid sidek and foo kok keong kok keong collecting another point narrowing down to three points three six an overhead cross court return by kok keong falls out of court and uh he concedes service to rashid sidek six three another long bogging rally rally between the two players and uh kok keong attempted and he falls into and he sends the ball into the net and uh rashid moves along to seven seven rashid three kok keong rashid was ready for those returns from kok keong and the he was at uh punish them and uh he sent the shot shuttle away from uh kok keong's reach and he moves on to nine nine three nine three another shuttle change while kok keong request that he be allowed to tie his shoe laces nine three rashid leading and uh we have to look at the way things went uh in last year's final this went to three but uh from the way things are going at this point uhm doesn't seem likely to be that way but uh anything can happen just as uh kok keong is just proven he is one service over at three nine he's six points behind and uh it's really tough to get six points because at this stage he's looking a very very tired man and the rashid still playing very aggressively very very deep net shot returned by rashid shidek hit the net court lightly and fell very deep for kok keong and kok keong had nothing else to do but uh watch it beat him all the way again i think attempting to return that shot from uh rashid shidek that trope shot from rashid shidek he keeps his racket to the shuttle gets gets it there but uh shuttle that didn't quite make it over the net and uh service is back with rashid at ten three or rather he rashid wins the point ten three he just move his service three ten seven points for kok keong to make up ground lost ground  word returned to kok keong rashid smashes it kok keong gets to it and sends it out of court and uh rashid gains back service at ten three ten three rashid sidek leading foo kok keong exellent play from the two players and unfortunately kok keong had to send it back and return out of court giving away another point to rashid eleven three i think it will be quite correct to say that uh rashid sets his victory he's eleven point and kok keong three that's eight point ahead kok keong he hit walks after the shuttle and watches it fall and it falls in court it's now twelve three three points away from victory and another mistake by kok keong pushing the shuttle a little too hard out of court and one more point for rashid sidek thirteen three he's two points away from the title the asian badminton championship crown one more mistake from foo kok keong and uh rashid's almost there he's almost there fourteen three a very weary foo kok keong technically if he puts up a fight as he attempts fight back i'm always a long way off but uh he's known to put everything into his match and who knows that's it foo kok keong he's up on this and rashid comes away with a defeating uh victory defeating that victory he he had over foo kok keong in nineteen ninety-one fifteen nine fifteen three rashid sidek beating foo kok keong of malaysia the victor foo kok keong the vanquished and the score fifteen nine fifteen three  well there's only one more match remaining on tonight's card and this will be the double final between the chinese player of chen yu min and wang zhang zong against the malaysian pair rashid sidek and jalan sidek 
Singapore	a back header by hitomo into the path of hadiyono or rather puteray this is puteray hadiyono or yes and that has given the indonesians the lead it took david by complete surprise coming in the eighth minute of play let's watch this again puteray sending the ball into the path of husaini who blasted the ball past a very surprised david lee to give the indonesians the lead fafri husaini the man to open counts for indonesia and that has not only taken david by surprise ational stadium by complete surprise so the indonesians take an early lead in the eighth minute of this asian cup group four qualifying round is this going to set singapore back or will this sting ramp into retaliation we hope that they have the character to pull the game up now they'd better because if they lose this they don't even have one point after two matches and if china beat malaysia that automatically eliminates singapore then china will have taken four points and coverchecks certainly looks like very dejected a person at the moment no team official would like to see his team going or trailing the opposition in such an early time in this match with only eight minutes of play gone by the indonesians getting themselves into the lead can pabanathan once again inspire the boys onto the equalizer latif abdullah and eunos moktar is there for indonesia hadiyono hadiyono once again pabah collecting it very calmly haslim kannan razali said moving up right now he's got devaraj on the right and he makes uses of devaraj he's across coming in yes he does and eddie haditono beats kannan to the ball first to the ball eddie hato this is that one man who's gotta gotta prove to be a real stumbling block to the singapore team in their search for the equaliser it's not just eddie hato the warning signs were there earlier on the indonesians were going in harder they seem half a step fast and i think to goal if we do get to see it again you'll see that the defenders back off the number nine widodo putro and he ran all the way into the box before he laid that ball back for pakri to take that shot and it was too well placed for david it's right in the side netting zainal pamah deveraj back to his captain haslim devaraj missing that one indonesia saying thank you very much and come away once again sydney pitono looking for husaini haslim down in defence the indonesians are just toying around in the singapore defence looking for players who are running into open spaces just uh picking their men up and knocking the ball around husaini up front still ahead pamah tidying up for singapore tong hai giving it to david lee putiray for you and now razali said zainal there's gonna be some switch of uh players tong hai i notice has moved over to the left pull back position zanial from the left pull back position has moved over to the right pamah must have uh made a couple of uh decisions on the spur of the moment looking at the indonesians who are moving around menacingly especially puteray and hitomo the indonesian's number nine and ten sudirman it's a long one opening up the game over to puteray going nowhere except to singapore's captain zainal latiff abdullah the shortest player but he's reputed to be the fittest player in the singapore side he's been given the opportunity to prove to prove that to the more than thirty-five thousand fans here in the national stadium today and another menacing indonesian attack hitting the upright going out of play off for singapore and it's going to be the first corner the first corner for the indonesians in fact and that was a long time coming but once again you can see that number seven man widodo putro he had just too much time the all the defenders were just backing off and giving him all the time in the world to run right through the indonesians taking their first corner widodo putro quarter of an hour gone by if you have just joined us let me tell you that uh singapore are trailing indonesian by one goal to nil the goal coming in the eighth minute through fafri husaini free kick to the indonesians inspired by that uh early goal they're going to be piling on the pressure on this singapore side razali organising his defence papa nathan the indonesians referee and they fail to keep that ball in place nearly a goal kick to singapore by the way the game is going now one doesn't give singapore much of a hope they seem to be disorganised latiff i presume he's nervous on his debut he's been a a trifle too anxious and i hope he settles down and has a good game k kannan for singapore haslim harom right now picking up devaraj and devar is another one of those players who has yet to settle down and he hasn't his touches have been a bit slack he hasn't played the ball with any conviction and he has left it short on a couple of occasions the ever reliable pamah nathan good pressure on the indonesians giving possession to singapore hasnian sending kannan through uh tuckey john it is and what is it the refugee place advantage tuckey john lost his balance haji santoso for indonesia the singapore boys should apply a lot more pressure on the indonesians uh especially in the middle of the park like what they did just a little while ago thereby winning the ball once again but right now they seem to be taking things in their stride and just dictating the pace of the game the indonesians seem to be uh playing the ball around so easily without much pressure really from the singapore side and that relates your observation which is a good one brian they're best they're just backing off they're not going in hard and you know challenging the indonesians i rather suspect they're afraid of the the pace the indonesians do have some very pacey boys and they're just giving them you know an extra yard or two which indonesians right now are taking full advantage of well the boys are falling into the same trap as in the in their opening match against malaysia where they were back dabbling especially so in the first half and they allowed the malaysians to take complete control of the first forty-five minutes and that's exactly what's happening here a repeat of the first half in singapore's open tie against malaysia but fortunately for singapore yes latiff abdullah with the first real good attempt at the indonesian goal latiff abdullah giving some hope for their singapore fans here in the national stadium we'll watch that again a very ambitious a very brave attempt by latiff abdullah he's got the right idea he might have to get in a bit closer because he's not going to be a goalie like eddie hato from that kind of range unless it's a a phenomenal shot which just finds a top corner or something but at least uh our strikers ought to take the cue from latiff abdullah and uh start shooting outside because otherwise if you have too much respect for haltoh you'll never get the goals without trying the fans getting a little impatient right now where singapore trail the indonesians from an early lead given by fafri husaini in the eighth minute of play so the indonesians are leading singapore one goal to nil after twenty minutes of this first half and the indonesians are pulling back once again rozali sahad puts his word away widodo putra giving possession to eunos moktar and right now sudirman up front for pitono haslim tong hai sending it away to touch for a throw in to the indonesians the indonesians seem to be enjoying dictating the game and our singapore will have to do something about the opportunity of uh taking advantage of possession as they move up instead of giving those balls away latiff abdullah looking for devaraj haslim up front for kannan and he is at an outside position david lee has come back once again sudirman they seem to be quite happy just retaining possession as long as you have possession there's nothing the opposition can do and this is exactly the predicament that the singapore boys are in at the moment he's compounding the effect that they're trailing one nil they got to get the ball back somehow and they're still allowing the indonesians way too much space a good block there by abdullah latiff and now singapore have the ball once again tong hai zainal or that's deva deva once again razali said kannan and a chance here for singapore oh yes that's a great goal what a brilliant goal there scored by razali said a saving equalizer from razali said and that came about in the twenty-second minute of play oh we just love to watch that again what a beauty of a goal what a beauty of a strike oh my god look at that brilliant and that was the first really good move that singapore had they knocked the ball above beautifully stringing their passes together and that was unstoppable unstoppable now razali said has been known to have scored goals from what uh twenty thirty metres out and there you are he has just proven very well that's uh what a relieve indeed for mish covercheck so that puts singapore back on terms and the teams are back to square one once again giving singapore some hope in their second match in this asian cup group four qualifying round and i just love the way razali said picked his spot and pelted the ball in in fact we have seen two great goals today yah two excellent shots i don't think the goal either goalie had a chance in the two goals spark preeze was deep in the the side netting and the ball actually stuck there trapped between this tension and the net and razali's was unstoppable and the fans are certainly celebrating with the kallang wave this is our very own version of the mexican wave oh yes what joy what celebration from the terraces and back to play right now but the indonesians are coming back relentlessly they are attacking in waves as well they certainly want to win this match after having lost to china in their opening tie two players committing themselves but uh terry pathanathan is so so for sure that he goes in he knows that he's gonna get the ball and he gets it what a first half this is turning out to be both teams starting off very cautiously but with indonesians taking singapore by surprise in the eighth minute with a goal from husaini suddenly found their lead being cancelled by razali said with a really marvellous goal that had eddie hato beaten there was no chance at all tong hai going up for that one save inside zainal was there doing good service for singapore their tails are up and now they're putting on a spur of display for the more than thirty-five thousand fans here at the national stadium as singapore go the attack haslim harun at the farside gets his cross in tocky john only down for aldi santoso and from there it goes to moktar that's the russian coach in charge of this indonesian side oh an opportunity that gave indonesia's way to give them the lead once again but this time david lee was certainly on his toes he read that very well yes he did and he's quick off his line and if he wasn't there that would have been two one to indonesia well played by david  so now singapore with that uh saving goal from razali said have a glimmer of hope once again with indonesians taking the singapore team off their strive regaining possession they come back once again husaini but he fails to beat haslim this time zulkifli and razali said they're back at the moment 
Singapore	as we see the table with singapore languishing at the bottom china is already through to the finals in hiroshima in october this year singapore the familiar all white china in red very familiar red tops well this should be a face-saving match for caber checks boys we will also use this game to prepare for the up-coming semi-pro league competition to start in may in fact uh to be precise uh they'll kick off on the ninth of may the semi-pro league against pahang that's chiupo on the ball for china and straight away they get down to business weiguo depamanathan for singapore oh that's kannan he has come down looks like kannan is gonna be take away quite a fair bit in the defence as well caber checks has uh resorted to zonal defence as oppose to applying the men to men system today the chinese are really very good ball players and they just enjoy running at the defenders they've got tremendous pace and the singapore boys just can't afford to apply the men to men system here so it's got to be zonal defence for singapore into the pourri comes chuipo good cross and out it goes on the head of uh maichiao that's maichiao for you he's been outstanding in this group for qualifying round competition for the asian cup pakma the singapore captain noor halishafik haslim trying to take over from where kannan was uh kannan left off and of course kannan will was foul in the process free kick given to singapore the first infringement committed in the game and china snugged that one out so very easily chuipo leaving it for pengwa upfront for chienli and pama tidying up the back for singapore rozali that was nazri looking for uh devaraj on the far side china is represented by a team from the guangtong province strengthening the goal-lead three players from beijing they've already settled down and they're beginning to dictate turns on the near side for the asian all-star player yishin and uh very quickly put to touch by a singapore defender throw-in to the people's republic of china chiupo yishin yishin once again still checking position for china but norhaliz was there he read that very very quickly throw-in for chuipo yishin haslim the boss and out it goes david says leave it for a goal kick that's wu chuenli one of the leading goal getters for the people's republic of china well after failing to qualify for the nineteen ninety world cup and the nineteen ninety-two olympic games china has decided to go through a rebuilding programme starting with this asian cup competition and they're well on their way to the final in hiroshima this october rozali saad for singapore now and hopefully we should be there to bring you all the action nasri rozali gaining control of the ball giving position to the people's republic of china once again eddy kum tearing back into the singapore defence now weiguo over to mengwa chaoyang chiupo he's another one of those stars for this uh chinese side playing for his country for many years now another goal kick to singapore and it's a question of time as to how long the boys will be able to weather the storm with the chinese applying early pressure already in this match the outcome certainly has got no bearings on their qualifying for the finals but still they would like to go up out of the competition with a clean slate winning all their matches against indonesia malaysia and now singapore free kick to singapore to be taken by zukifli catiomo and the players move up now the white shirts go to the top of the chinese penalty box devaraj turning it round word  tim no problems whatsoever for o chiuliang mengwa chiupo chaoyang when we talk about total football just watch this chinese team players who are slated down to play in mid-field there down to defence there up in the striker's position in the next moment they're all over each and everyone of these players in this uh chinese side put in a lot uh hard work tremendous work rate here displayed by these chinese boys and singapore conceding a corner teng weiguo to lift the ball from the corner blight word good sliding tackle by elsri getting singapore out of trouble haslim ipichil looking for devaraj and now nasri good cover by mengwa ai zhiao said devaraj and the boys in their eagerness to try and take control of the game seem to be making a lot of mistakes and uh giving away possession to china from said shuko to rozali saad back to said shuko basically a stopper he seems to be the rightful back position caber check they still using his three two three two formation but they've got to be a lot tighter in defence applying of course the zonal defence to try and shut up the chinese attack chee mengwa liyong chineng oh that's chaoyang yijeng mengwa chuipo they're trying to draw the singapore forwards word  of the singapore players toward them before trying to prize open the defence looking for gaps in the singapore defence and they've conceded another corner word  that one in hasmil gets it away kannan keeping his balance very nicely there despite the challenge and here's haslim harun yes he's got an option there in the person of nasri devaraj asking for for the ball but nasri decides to hit for goal and the ball has gone out for a goal kick to the people's republic of china good attempt by nasari nasir and the chinese come back once again it is pretty evident that the chinese are holding back they're just waiting for the right ball to strike and the singapore defenders especially will have to be very very weary they knocked the ball around in the middle of the field but when they get it to the word third of the field they will just accelerate their pace and great focal halim for singapore looking for support he gets it from devaraj and good return to haslim and he's got one player to beat with two others coming back and that's chuiliang making sure although that ball looked destined to go out for a goal kick but chuiliang nevertheless went down for that slow build-up as usual chaoyang very nicely taken there away by tonghai it comes back once again to weiguo on the outside for chaoyang and david gets to the ball first ahead of chienli zukifli tonghai we see a lot of central defenders in the singapore today in fact uh the defence is made up essentially of uh central defenders there's depamanathan who is uh playing the sweeper's role then there's lim tonghai said shuko noor halishafik and rozali saad they're all central defenders this chinese squad has been under intensive training in uh guangzhou in preparation for this competition and as part of their preparations they played against the united states and canada losing five nil to the us team and five two to canada but uh as we've seen they're they're all set to give a good account of themselves in hiroshima yes the team comes from guangtong but uh their preparations were in guangzhou they've got only three players from beijing in this squad chiupo forward to chienli yishin this is yishin pamanathan yes pamanathan playing a real captain's game tonghai noor haliz back to david lee and the singapore defenders are certainly taking their chances there in the defensive third of the field knocking the ball around they sure look pretty confident with their skills gone away with that one especially in the face of the fast running yishin yishin once again noor haliz trying to get to the ball first but he was prevented from doing so good shielding by yishin and of course he was pulled off for tackling from behind so a free kick given to the people's republic of china they push most of their players up into the singapore penalty box said goes up with that one and tonghai the second time tonghai once again and out it goes for a goal kick to singapore noor haliz he was rested in uh singapore's last match against indonesia said devaraj rozali saad the chinese players are extremely fast you see them putting the pressure on the singapore players in the middle of the pitch they don't allow the singapore players to get into their penalty area before they shut them out they shut them out right there in the middle of the word they apply the pressure all the away they don't give the singapore boys room to manoeuvre and chineng just gave that away and i'm sure the singapore defenders are grateful for that goal kick to singapore we've got about fifteen minutes of play gone by and still singapore is still holding their on no goals at the moment interception by chuipo tonghai comes back and pama gears for nazarene haslim haslim once again kannan's making his move he leaves the ball off the side he gets it from razali and now kannan in possession you see how the chinese players cover all those passing and those making it very very difficult for the player on the ball to look for his team-mates pamanathan sending that one to the middle of the box and it's get away to safety oh good play by devaraj he's through a promising move there by dedevaraj and he certainly raise the hopes of the twenty thousand fan here at the national stadium at least for a moment as singapore move into the offensive and uh very nearly made something out of that move the singapore boys will have to be uh a lot more assured tonghai with a big header a tackle by said said shuko giving away a free kick to china he certainly had his eye maichiao couldn't allow maichiao to take control of the ball this is the man who orchestrate all the goals for china weiguo still taking possession ai chao slip that one in to number six yichun good play by depamanathan norhaliz kannan to haslim tonghai switching play to saad shuko pakma devaraj and devaraj committing an error there couldn't decide which way the ball was going very good one-touch play by the chinese they're running off the ball is certainly a treat for all soccer fans get the ball hit it and then run into word  spaces for the return said shuko was there chuipo with the throw-in pamanathan reads the game very very well noor haliz did a bit of playing david i'm sure will want to acquit himself well today as he says that this is gonna be his swan song noor haliz glad to be playing in the left pull back position with uh saad shuko taking care of the rightful back position the chinese coming back once again yijun noor haliz very careful play there by noor haliz and he decides to draw  word for a goal david lee stopping that almost off the line and he hit upright a good attempt there by li chaoyang we'll watch the action replay on that one a chance given to chaoyang by noor haliz he went for goal fortunately david was in corner of that time and he prevented china from taking the lead back to play and china given a free kick and that was because uh said shuko uh tackled one of the chinese players from behind so a free kick given to the people's republic of china the singapore boys are all down into their defence no one is up even kannan and there's devaraj in front their kicker liyong rozali gave that away oh and here's the danger man failing to keep in playing that's uh xie yishin the twenty-three year old yishin who has been kept sixty-three times for his country asian all-star material and now singapore get possession  tonghai it's gonna be difficult to break this chinese defence down that's what the singapore boys are trying to do 
Singapore	for a goal kick then to uh trengganu in this the twenty-six minutes of this second-half no scores then singapore nil and trengganu nil but we witnessed at least three golden opportunities to have scored singapore at least with one clear shot by trengganu that even that that didn't materialise certainly been a night of misses so trengganu going for that uh one point against singapore here happily in a second position up there right on top uh second only to johor then trengganu then sabah and selangor singapore fighting very very hard to get into the uh quarter finals and of course not to be uh relegated even in the penalty area one uh is leah trying one went over the goal line david lee asking for the ball to be brought back and as the minutes tick away the fifty thousand here getting a little impatience we've seen a good match an extremely good match but nothing to uh to count for sudiah dali on the left getting way pass the randasander still with it now singapore's uh uh haslim a lovely ball there effectively right across the field down to zukifli now singapore for triads with uh jocky john falling down getting himself up again but trengganu now ledging themselves to this ball and crossing it into the singapore half singapore rushing down to defend still with the ball a long try this must come from this man uh zabric i think it is now the near side number fifteen rosli ishak the man we saw coming in just now nodi word of singapore managing to swat that attack down to haskin harun haslim from the centre he streams word off the ball extremely well down to wing onn on that very far side wing onn trying to beat one man that man is hasnan ahmad he doesn't quite get way pass that man and so trengganu now retaliate from their own half trying to get away referee saw that bit of pushing there uh by uh let's see now it was uh zukifli and he has awarded a free kick for trengganu uh in their own half just just about centre of their own half ball quickly taken ball goes down to tusma hosmak and hosmak uh due to word  sends it back to his skipper zubit ibrahim with great force uh challenging him in the process zubit drops tracks and drops gets off the head of uh eusoff now it's saishuno and shuko in a clash there with uh trengganu boy tempers flaring and my goodness gracious me that was a bit  word going around here we have malin randa and there seem to be a little fight here roklin with steven daivd lee coming in the thick of it all malin vandasanda getting a little bit hot behind the collar growing in the word there but i think the referee has got the situation well in control the police are coming and bar them on the track the referee will certainly have to give the red card at least to at least one or two one singaporean i think also but uh well let's see how the referee handle this situation he's got malin vandasanda pulled into the side and he's also got said shuko now said shuko was also instrumental in that little bit of flare up said shuko was brought down and now they've got their names taken in the infamous book of the referee let's see the colour of the card that comes off well you know looking from that angle they're now shifting my eyes to the left we see drinks coming in and both the teams sharing a cup or two we have temas hosmak a yellow card uh awarded to both malin vandasanda and sye said shuko that's pretty mild i would say because uh it was uh almost bordering on uh a fist fights here at the national stadium and i think a yellow card to uh malin vandasanda and singapore's said shuko i guess is a fair a fair decision but nevertheless having said that we still have that man in trengganu still on the ground he's been there for the past three or four minutes and he is uh rosli ishak right the man we saw coming in just will word  replacing arifin osman he was a man uh uh well i wouldn't say instrumental but at least he was in the thick of it all the cause of little uh fracas here at the national stadium now he's been uh uh place on a stretcher and uh carried off by four i think they must be from saint saint john's ambulance brian uh one of the reasons uh malin vandasanda lost his uh cool for a moment was because uh said shoko the man who uh inflicted that uh injury on rosli ishak and hadn't scratched it out but oh but he's up and he's back into the field of play once again so it makes you wonder whether that was serious enough to warrant that incident you know brian that is the epitome of play acting as i was saying uh malin vandasanda is very very frustrated because said shuko has been doing an extremely good job of shackling him and uh this of course uh gave him the opportunity of uh pushing said shuko and trying to take the law into his own hands you know uh it is very very humourous because there was rosli ishak in the thick of it all he was trying to gain the sympathy of the referee he was lying motionless on the field of play for about three minutes he even had the stretcher transported from the field of play out of the field of play and when he looked around he had found that everyone a yellow card he bounced back got himself off the stretcher and ran back and took up position now that is i think uh warrants a contract a contract probably with sbc i've seen a lot of things in these past years brian but that i think i must really take my hat off to him on the you you gonna say something are you well anyway well he didn't want to see his team down uh to ten men and uh in fact he sees a replacement for arifin osmund so he had to get back into the thick of action well now it's trengganu then one uh is uh well have ball is got the ball shot right across the head of uh zulkifi it still uh uh little bit of dangerous situation for singapore because the action was dated back now greg foster greg foster for letting a true ball on the far side of the field can jocky john get himself to the ball no he can't greg was in for the for second attempt then he gets himself to the ball then a very side is that uh uh ushami lock wing onn now on the near side here this is word  the long ball coming to the sidelines here grim slightly uh uh trengganu half hasni trying to get it back into play again a push out to touch and hasim will just have to content with just a throw in well the pace of this uh match is really fast and furious as both teams go for one another singapore desperately needing to win trengganu trying to hold on to at least a goal as draw and come away with a point share points here with singapore in singapore's home tie in this semi-pro cup tie against trengganu and there's still no score at the moment trengganu in attack a long ball word the top of the singapore penalty area to the head of malin vandasandan who knocks it down to wan izila keeps it in play and he sends it to rosli ishak back to wan izila izila's his ball across the ball to malin vandasandan and it's the boys sulia dali into the middle of the pitch it goes it's anybody ball as the ball uh keeps on word  and leaving and haslim harun picks it up and he went straight into the trengganu defence defeats one two three but not the third man he was beaten there by the trengganu defender zabri mohammud nor doing very well rosli ishak picks it up in mid-field right now but he couldn't keep control of the ball it goes to touch corner throw in to singapore to be taken by singapore's left quarter-back sudia dali dali very quickly down to foster foster juggling the ball looking for a teammate he finds zulkifli zulkifli sending it back to foster the goal-keeper was out of position that's the reason why the crowd word  foster to get on with the game and uh apparently the defender who stopped haslim from uh going through on his own was zabri mohammud nor he's flat on the ground and the goal-keeper zubir ibrahim wanted to bring the referee's attention to this injured player zabri mohammud nor and he was completely out of position whereas the referee allowed play to continue and he was in a situation where he would have been out of position had uh foster crossed the ball earlier and singapore would have scored and he was very very upset he wanted to go for the referee but one of his defenders stopped him from doing so and attention now that play has been halted ttention has been given to this injured player zabri mohammud nor and he's been taken care of right now the stretcher boys are on the pitcher play and they've got him on a stretcher and he's got to go to the far side of the field in the meantime uh i think a goal kick is gonna be given to trengganu we've got something like uh thirty-five thirty-six minutes of play gone by thirty-six minutes of play gone by in this second-half trengganu nil singapore nil goal kick taken by their keepers zabir ibrahim right into the middle of the pitch it goes singapore picking it up haslim harun with the ball relays it to foster foster down to wing onn yes and a shot here a golden opportunity for singapore to score and wing onn turned around very quickly with his left leg he putted towards his trengganu goal the goal-keeper was out of position but uh fortunately for trengganu the ball went high and wide for a goal kick so they live again to fight and they intend to do just that as they match singapore in pace and determination keeping their score lying clean no score at the moment singapore desperately needing to win as trengganu come back right now malin vandasanda with the ball in the singapore half he comes at the top of the bucks he crosses only for boran ahdusamad to clear over to haslim haslim bringing the ball forward playing the fetch and carry role he crosses the ball to the far side over to wing onn wing onn is free he's got one man to beat now he beats the man crosses the ball yes and it's clear the way by zagariah musah and he's clearing to touch for a touch in to singapore what exciting moments here in the national stadium as the fifty thousand fans rise and cheer all these exciting moments they're enjoying it but what they really want is a goal from the home team are they gonna get it and we don't have very much time left trengganu i'm sure will be very very happy very pleased with themselves if they can come away with a draw singapore in the mean time putting the pressure on trengganu as they get another corner haslim swings the ball in zubir got his uh hands behind that ball there was a bit of a push on zubir ibrahim and the referee's awarded the free kick to trengganu zubri 
Singapore	one thing they can tell the thais is not to take the guys in green lightly myanmar's football have certainly their football has certainly been more colourful than their outfits allowing it to run vitoon here's attapong offside though well i've got a feeling that soe naing who uh did quite a good job marking fandi ahmad out at the first ninety minutes of the game against singapore in the semi-finals will be given the task of marking piyahpong again and min zaw who went for sundram that day will go for vitoon he has lost it for a little while actually that was min zaw oo and soe naing with that saving tackle then toe aung so a nervous start indeed for myanmar they're an inexperience squad not used to matches of this high magnitude but like i've said they've maintained nice splat of oozing self-belief and confidence they need it more so now kyi lwin who is one of their more experienced players they'll be a calling on him to over ball in mid-field and settle the team down at the moment it's thailand who are faster in settling down ye htut it would be at a right time there for myanmar not a very good clearance surachai min zaw oo with good tackle and here's myo hlaing the top scorer of this competition with six goals tin myo aung who uh was taken over myint aung up front  word to bounce to the ball then and here's attapong vitoon kijmongkonsak wins the first corner of the afternoon in the sea games soccer final thailand after four minutes are looking livelier and brighter up front and uh passing has been more fluent as well but myanmar it is who win the header it's not all the way out though they're slow in moving up that's why vitton is offside apichad almost got to the end of it tawan sripan well won though by than toe aung good ball clear by toe aung and that's myanmar's football for you throughout this tournament nice one touch passing oh it's saved by the thai goalkeeper and that's one of the greatest goals you'll ever see at the national stadium scored by that guy again myo hlaing win myanmar ahead in the sea games soccer final and really the inexperience of the eighteen year old goalkeeper somcit wacharapong was very evident there in the thai goal it's a big sin in goal keeping you'll always have to make sure that your body is behind the ball at time his body wasn't even around that and his reflexes were very poor that's the way to do it says aung kyaw kyaw as he gathered that shot from uh attakpong quite easily and really that effort looked harmless vitton this is turning out to be a magnificent final unbelievable and you're just describing myanmar's character and how interesting it is if thailand were to go a ball down since they haven't been a goal down before in the tournament well this is their word  well we were just talking about vitoon being up front with piyapong and vitoon doesn't have the pace of a striker and doesn't have the traditional sense of a striker but he's certainly showed the finishing touches of a striker then piyapong just well he's all fired up for the final yes word he set the tournament alive like we expected him to so but when piyapong is on form and the thais are now inspired myanmar better watch them well that's been myanmar's football all the time in the games they'll score a goal they'll conceive one it's always hoping but they always believe in attacking whatever the case kyaw kyaw the word looking suspect indeed and being with a cross so we have two goals in two minutes so naing in the fifth for myanamr and vitoon in the seventh for thailand it's one all a well-balanced final indeed i suppose exactly what happened in the bang against malaysia and they're going a goal up earlier on and then malaysia scoring fairly quicker myanmar have been very disciplined moving forward but not really at the back that was the eighth goal conceived from them kyi lywin lovely play by kyi lywin again and he's taken off against uh singapore and it seems that he was taken off at half time probably to rest him for the final and that's how confident the myanmar players were he was limping a bit but he wasn't really that bad when you consider that malek had pulled a hamstring in the semi-finals and was taken off immediately before the scoring of the two sides well played by moe kyaw tawan sripan this is a wonderful run by him he's beaten two men two men nine word up for vitoon again and well we apologise as the scorer of thailand well there was no need to actually it's was just very badly struck from the number forty thailand goal will relate to that very well thailand have certainly started the game up much brighter and more confident than myanmar well with the experience big big game well turning it on that counts most thailand are certainly going it towards a gold medal in the sea games soccer final and it's that guy piyapong pueon who wins a header two headers remember in the final in nineteen eighty-three against singapore got thailand on the way to a two one victory on the gold medal and this header could prove to be very important as well in the eleventh minute thailand lead by two goals to one once again very poor defending by myanmar he's already stated that this could be his last sea games and they want to bring the gold medal back desperately to thailand they haven't won it since nineteen eighty-five and they win singapore two nil on home ground but myo hlaing we all know about myanmar's come back word  how determined they are and they word back at you good work once again by myo hlaing thought that was a foul actually and they claim that it's a pass back by the defender myo hlaing the goalkeeper didn't pick that one up so a relief indeed to somcit wacharapong his fifth minute error is giving myanmar that kind of start they wanted myo hlaing he has been the live wire of the myanmar team at the moment myo hlaing he's the only one who wants the ball just attacking it the rest they're just waiting for the ball to land at their feet kyaw kyaw finding some room for that cross myanmar remember the privilege two of the most exciting matches in the sea games against malaysia and of course the epic battle in the semi-final against singapore myo aung tawan sripan too much of the ball myo hlaing wins good skill again by myo hlaing oh lovely ball played outside here's ye htut can he get the cross in no and he doesn't even get the corner good work by surasak tungsurat nice little leap by piyahpong well won in the air here's surasak tungsurat there phathanapong not convincely surachai as well here's apichad thaveechalerndit he started out as a right back in this tournament and he's moved forward to uh mid-field now after is he's word placed in the middle of the path against malaysia and indonesia good work by the seventeen year old zaw oo and here's kyi lwin that's more like it from kyi lwin the spreading play up myo hlaing taking over good play here's kyi lwin myo hlaing again great tackle second time around as well by apichad thaveechalermdit and myanmar could be in trouble here the thais are very quick they're trying to break that time on the counter they almost did then toe aung who scored five goals in the tournament so far nice oh it was a typical myanmar move myanmar are very slick on the ground doing a lot of player surachai jaturappattarapong word beating almost didn't work and it's gone out and we've got quarter of an hour gone by and a lot of action three goals to talk about two to thailand one to myanmar and now we even have uh substitution early one saw ba myint has been taken off he hasn't had a good time at the back saw ba myint the sweeper and uh they have changed it to than win this is really a gamble by the coach playing someone to the heart of defence who's only had one game prior to this game easy cross to deal with he wanted something spectacular the substitute than win and after both sides after that word have settle down a little good ball once again by kyi lwin nice movement upfront by myanmar it's not being shown at the moment and perhaps that is where they are missing wyin aung now wyn aung does a lot of the after ball movement surachai surasak easy for the defender there soe moe kyaw an unorthodox word he's playing for noe kyaw because he plays a left mid-field when they're attacking and left back on the defender offside vitoon kijmongkonsak word  offside clearly for that well any three of the players in thai team as starting to line up in today's final played in the merlion cup tournament way back in december and they send really they've re-teamed it for there's a lot of depth in thailand foot in thai football have they not got they own semi-professional leave back home well the only weakness actually you can spot off myanmar's kyi lwin is that he doesn't get back and defend as uh as his good as his attacking players  word aung hung the body of surasak  word  even bury and his way ye htut kyi lwin plays for perak of course in the semi-pro league here he is again oh now that's probably summarises myanmar's uh feel of the moment towards this game a lack of cohesion at the back which is very evident and of course all control and in that time by surachai jaturapattarapong here's myo hlaing win who has been the best player so far a time well shut up by surasak nobody offering support though for surachai and he makes place for the shot he tried to curl it but nobody saw them that was uh an old thai error they're not running it to place and no support up front that was very evident in the semi-final the first half semi-final against indonesia and also in the first half against myanmar in the opening match and that time the same time we saw the old myanmar error of not attacking the player on the ball apichad thaveechalermdit nice little one to play with vitoon exquisitely done there great skill by the number fourteen to bear it off and laid back for apichad who made some nice good running into the penalty box certainly sample something from myanmar there the thais and they could learnt how to defend against there as well myo hlaing he's been trying to prove too much at times myo hlaing win oh poor ball by moe kyaw apichad who has been busy in mid-field natee tongsukkao well that call it his solid defender at their tournament here he is again he's been cleared by than win halfway through this match and thailand are leading by two goals to one all the action coming in the first ten minutes poor finish by tawan sriman and i don't ever remember him having a shot on target rather tournament tawam sriman  word and certainly it's uh myanmar throwing an unfamiliar sight there at the national stadium and not passing the ball around and too word spread out very well and it's contested again on this side the thais will like this the myanmar players really have to go in and attack them and stop the game in mid-field  that's where the thais are winning the battle at the moment department separate the winner and the loser apichad thaveechalermdit soe aung chasing it and thais happy to just toss the ball around defenders three goals to one league they finally lose it what can myanmar do now moe kyaw good play by soe moe kyaw well it's a nice one here by moe kyaw a chance though now for than toe aung who's happy to settle for the corner strangely because there are

eighteenth sea games his name sawadi sawadi hello well if that's not a siamese cat i don't what it is sawadi there a little bit shy at the moment i think singa still centre stage and enjoying himself well certainly the rhythm has changed it's definitely thai ah nice close up there sawadi he does look rather shy actually sawadi of course is the multi-layered thai greeting it can mean anything from hello good morning good afternoon so remember it if you're going to thailand in two years' time for the eighteenth south-east asia games so with the departure of singa sadawi we're now going to showcase thailand thai item coming up very shortly as the host country this item we haven't actually seen word  loy kratong now fills the stadium the music of thailand and it's not just flash bulbs going off from the background the torches and the uh the closing kit are certainly proving very popular and that facet city hall is really interesting yes right it dissolves into a thai item entitled savakchaiak drums savakchaiak drum part of the word thai among the thai village of thais time performed to either proclaim a military victory by a king or during martial combat  and the beating of the large drum required much virtuosity using several parts of the drum including wood frame to create a variety of sounds and we have a medium-fast beat at the moment a slow beat and a very very quick beat which i'm sure we'll see before the end of this item this performance is very popular but it's only in fact seen in northern thailand usually at the head of parades chiangmai of course is the northern island  
Singapore	we certainly hope that they could uh uh put this behind them and uh proceed with the semi-pro league and uh come out with uh flying colours tonight well sarawak had the first throw in of the game and their attack at singapore defence straight away michael vana trying to latch onto the loose ball which was actually a very poor pass laid on by haslim harun then and that's abdullah bohan back in singapore colours you wouldn't expect him to play at the start of the season especially when midel scavachek opted for stoppers instead in of full back but he's back that's noor halis also in the starting line up tonight a quick ball forward and a nice header down there by haslim to kannan kannan got the better of uh evans only for awhile and it's a goal kick to sarawak k kannan who hasn't scored in this semi-pro league yet i'm sure he'd would gladly love to open his word  uh his accounts tonight and start a scoring spree for singapore and the last time of course he's scored at the national stadium was last season but for a different team for kuala lumpur and that goal knocked singapore out of the malaysia cup proper john hunter climbing so very well for that one he pits a real wallop in his shots john hunter and he's out to prove he is what the papers have uh put him out to be a proven goal scorer auyong how would you uh what would you think of and what would you do if you're faced with an opponent like john hunter well uhm uh looking at him he's big and hefty i would imagine that uh tong hai should always uh get between uh him and his goal in order to have uhm some uh head start especially when the ball is still behind tong hai but i think uh tong hai being uh very young and uh energetic i think he's uh he will do a good job from uh john hunter this evening michael vana another one of the surging runs into the opposition penalty area devaraj couldn't control the ball well enough he was dropped for the game against negri sembilan but he is back to prove that he is first eleven material and he's scored in the first game against trenggannu he's trying to weave past his defenders again he does well but the goal-keeper had no problems in catching the ball maslan won it he's had no problem so far maslan wahid but he well looking at the the way sarawak played last season he's a little suspect when it comes to the high balls but then again when you uh cross the ball into the penalty area you've got jeff current there to cut all the loose balls out for sarawak hunter asking for the ball he wants it placed right at his head but it's vana who hits the ball clear only as far as jeff current razali said an aimless fall that time aiming just to clear it instead of uh passing it to a fellow team mate of his and this is haslim harun back in defence good play here by singapore papanathan vana sent tumbling down there by the sarawak defender there razali singapore players knocking the ball around very confidently but of course the fans would love to see the boys knocking the ball that way in the opposition's half instead of their own half but they're building slowly and steadily right into the half of the orange shirted players vana back to abdullah bohan  word left pull by abdullah bohan very nice indeed to see him back again in the national team here i mean uhm so far uh singapore has been uh trying to uh uh build up the play word  i carry on from auyong has uh michael vana took his first attempted goal and a very good one as well and brought it down the ball down very well after a good lay out by k kannan but that was a good save indeed by the goal-keeper the shot didn't carry too much power but still mazan wahid got down to the ball well good shot by vana as you were saying auyong right i i would imagine that uh singapore is doing uh they're very cautious at the moment they're playing the ball uh to the feet and uh they're attempting to penetrate the middle but i would imagine that uh having a tall defenders like dave evans and uh uh in the middle they should uh try and use more of the flanks to uh send the ball in uh for our meaty uh forward uh kannan and devaraj vana again vanar on the move good play by michael vana what a start again and he's just won't stop scoring would he the fans just love him right here and five minutes gone by singapore are already leading by one goal to nil and that would go down at one of the greatest malaysia cup goals ever scored by a singapore player he got the ball from haslim and he cut in from almost thirty metres out he let three defenders in his wake and just slotted the ball into the nets to give singapore the start at their grand top and that kind of start that coach p m sivagy had ask for what do you see of the goal auyong that was a brilliant by uh vana indeed he uh he took the ball and uh he managed to uh weave his way pass a couple of defenders in the middle before the slotting the ball in i think that was a classic piece of uh move by vana and look at that wonderful shooting wonderful control of the ball and so cool when it comes through the final touch it is fifth goal of the competition and he's way ahead at the top-scorer the goal top goal getter of the year award kannan with a nice back heel to malek kawoff malek standing up to his opposition very well but jeff current is little too tall for devaraj i don't think devaraj can actually saw that ball perfect into the penalty box at all let's see the goal from this lovely angle auyong ya well uh it's a a really uh brilliantly struck uh left footer into the uh left bottom corner of the net uh well credit must certainly be given to uh uh vana he did really well there oh in case you just saw the instant replay from the back of the nets let me tell you that it was vana who scored the goal you couldn't really see him scoring it but it was him who started goal passed maslan wahid it's still there by effendi julaihim and here's vana again look at him go a ball cut inside well served to kannan and here's vana faced with the australian defender good skill by devaraj good turn now to haslim and jeff current doing all he can a little bit messy it might be but he did all he can to prevent haslim and kannan to word doing up something for singapore again and the boys are really swarming and launching weight after weight at the sarawak defence aren't they ya they suddenly uh are doing that and uh if they mount and continued to uh treasure the the sawarakian defence i'm sure we'll see a second goal very soon uh mark the fans down here certainly hope they do vana a lovely pull back then a good word inside but well cleared by david evans good ball by noor halis shafik one advantage of having noor halis shafik to the back liners that he provides all the uh ground skills whereas the other two tong hai and papanathan provide the aerial skills uh yes indeed uh shafik has always been a very uh tough player oh so close razali said who threatened to score a few goals from outside the box against trengganu almost got the shot on target and gave singapore a two goal cushion in the first ten minutes of the match ya yes indeed razali said indeed packs a a real wallop in both his feet and uh it will certainly be a pleasure if you could see another of his uh replays uh in the previous games john hunter very difficult to shake him off the ball indeed all hundred kilograms of the big man the big sarawakian in fact he's an australian playing in sarawak pama cut that one out easily not convincingly but good enough to prevent that sarawak way from turning word  here is razali said he's given the role of orchestrating the move from mid-field tonight and he's certainly did very then on that part on that time that occasion but malek kawak was not allowed to pump a good cross into the sarawak penalty box although it was illegal a bad tackle then by mohammud dalan and a free kick for singapore in a very dangerous position razali said behind the ball michael vana it's the head that he'll be looking for mazlan wahid he's not very confident well with vana scoring a goal in the fifth minute of play earlier and we don't expect mazlan to be most confident person in the world at the moment it's a stadium packed to the fullest at least fifty thousand people here tonight and they've had a a lot to cheer about after only ten minutes of play gone by but i'm sure they will want more from the singapore team sarawak trying to regain their composure which they showed in the early stages of the match i'm sure it was definitely shattered that was michael vana he's reading his way round the defence so easily and putting the ball at the back of the sarawak net only five minutes of play gone by haslim who had just taken position of the ball abdullah bohan here is malek singapore boys practising patience in their build up devaraj and a chase for the ball with uh david evans and uh devaraj did enough to shake david evans off the ball to win a throw in for singapore vana he's got two players polis policing him but he gets the ball in time to kannan and devaraj didn't lift the ball high enough to get the ball pass evan's head noor halis noor halis shafik good play by noor halis he's got support from vana and he uses it vana down to devaraj then to kannan he saw some sheer tugging then by dave evans which the referee also saw and they didn't escape the referee's eyes then so it's a free kick at the edge of the sarawak box we've got about uhm just about twenty metres outside the penalty box and we've seen vana striking he's struck a very good shot against trenggannu which just sailed over the bar and i'm sure he might want to do better in a situation like this now kannan is also behind the ball but kannan heads it straight at the ball vana with the second bite of the apple and all the way back for singapore to do some defending tong hai lost a little ball control then tong hai a little bit off his balance but then of course it's much better for him to clear the ball into the sarawak half and leave it to the sarawak players uh to build up from their very own half than to clear it in his own half and uh put singapore under some pressure hunter oh that's some confidence morale boosting effect on uh lim tong hai ahead of one against john hunter malek t papanathan haslim he's got some space here to try he which he does but his shots just uh wasn't suited for a goal calibre and i'm sure that haslim he himself would have hoped for a better shot  auyong how have you see the match gone by thirty minutes of play gone by and uh how how is the match gone by in your opinion 
Singapore	but the but singapore are still facing the same situation here they're down by a goal to nil against kuala lumpur but they have a chance to redeem themselves haslim a good shot by haslim and it just sailed over the bar and that believe it or not is uh singapore's first attempted goal first good attempt haslim had run earlier he shot wide and very feebly the only encouraging sign like i said is singapore are putting a lot of pressure on the kuala lumpur players they look dangerous only from a couple of long shots and the goal came about as a result of pathanathan's mistake when he actually played the ball into the path anton bravo allowing him to run at the singapore defence once again some good play by kuala lumpur and this is the defender coming up to join the attack so kuala lumpur is still hanging on to that one goal lead against singapore scored in the nineteenth minute from azman adnan and the big question that was raised before this match will singapore miss michael varna well at the moment i have to say yes because there's no forward no mid-fielder who's runnning at the kuala lumpur defenders at the moment good cross by abdullah bohan on the run but a good catch by v muruggan who seems to be very confident coming out of his box collecting these crosses he is a good goalie he had his critics say a couple of seasons ago but ever since then he's just grown from strength to strength nazri latiff abdullah we haven't seen much of latiff and his uh hard runs and we see him losing the ball again singapore defenders a little bit slow to shoot this down oh good tackle fantastic last minute saving tackle by noor haliz shafik and abdul malek must be panicking at the moment he must be wondering where his defence is azman adnan once again almost profiting from a defensive lapse by a singapore player that time latiff abdullah who's come up to the near post to do his defensive duties now five goals so far one in the f a m cup azman abdullah certainly a striker for the future for kuala lumpur and malaysia of course noor haliz once again doing some appearing for singapore and the pressure from k kannan the miss kick by chai siew yai and it's a throw to for singapore haslim nazri good ball by nazri nazir oh word just misjudged that ball the ground is a little bit slip slippery i must state after a downpour in the early part of the afternoon and the late stage late part of the aft morning right here at the national stadium and so the pitch is a little bit slippery and soggy tonight and that could only encourage uh singapore team to take shot at goal which uh sadly they're not doing at the moment abdullah bohan latiff abdullah back to uh malek return by malek kawak and malek even finding it hard to control the ball on the track let alone on the grass it's all going wrong for the singapore team at the moment good play by nazri nazir claimed that he was held back but the referee thought otherwise and has given a throw in to kuala lumpur nazri has uh had a good few good games for singapore latiff abdullah using his chest to put effects there but not a very good ball by malek kawak almost putting uh nazri nazir into a very dangerous situation where the kuala lumpur defender see kim savan amin nasir anton bravo climbing and beating malek kawak easily kannan good play by k kannan and definitely a foul zoran nicholich the culprit then but that's good close control by k kannan and some encouraging signs for the singapore team we've had twenty-seven minutes gone by we had a goal and it's come from the tigers in red of kuala lumpur azman adnan the hero at the moment malek chasing very hard for this one oh that's cool defending fantastic defender by chai siew yeow wonderful play and uh anton bravo was misreading that for a little while allowing it to go out ball a throw in to singapore not as many people coming here to watch tonight's match and at the moment the rate the singapore boys are going there might be even less in the next match latiff abdullah oh failing to control that and the singapore team not only finding it hard to string their passes together but they're also finding it difficult to control the ball on this very slippery pitch anton bravo now that's good ball control sharom abdul majid coming in from the blind side almost catching papanathan and he was very confident that his custodian would get to the ball which he did and here is noor haliz shafik nazri coming down deep to collect and fetch and carry abdullah mohan good header to haslim faced with uh rajid ismail good ball inside for malek a lovely ball for kannan will interception go danger's not over yet for kuala lumpur here's comes k kunalan faced with k kunalan oh good play by kannan got past kunalan so very easily but kunalan did enough to push him away for the ball latiff not the biggest of players but got got up so well for that one here is nazri nazri trying to do a little too much abdullah mohan can he keep it in play yes he can now what kind of cross is he gonna give a good one going past every player except to malek kawak singapore boys enjoying some pressure until that poor ball in fact poor play malek kawak allowing zoran nicholich to to free azman adnan danger for singapore once again azman interest wide in fact i think abdul malik got a good fingertip at the ball to divert it out for a corner to kuala lumpur it could have been two nil so very easily and once again from the mistake by a singapore mid-fielder a lapse of concentration this time in the kuala lumpur half and it just takes one pass from zuran nicholich to uh give the strikers some rule to run at the singapore defenders that's the mark of the great player he saw what malek was going to do robbed him and set up the attack papanathan cleared the danger for a little while but it's not over yet nicholich grabo the two co-eds linking up together and uh latiff bounced off the tree top latiff abdullah although he would claim that he played a one two then ball back to papanathan then to kannan easing up some pressure now from the singapore side devaraj good control by deveraj then to nazri nazri with a good ball out to abdullah bohan abdullah has got a defender to beat and abdullah is uh showing some poor ball control on this right flank bertrand that his is problem actually he is a very tough hard uncompromising player but his control does leave a little bit more to be desired at this level shariff mohammud out jumped by noor halis anton down with an injury at the moment been half an hour gone by in fact my watch says thirty-two minutes gone by singapore haven't had a serious attempt at the kuala lumpur goal yet and b muruggan has had a a very a field day except for some crossing to the penalty box which he gathered quite well he's had an easy time with the singapore strikes word good ball haslim harun and that's the danger posed by latiff abdullah he's seem small you cannot see him and you know when he comes from deep he just beats the defenders and sometimes you can't he sneaks in from behind and uh he sneaks in from behind and actually just uh grabs the ball from you when you're attacking with without even knowing it there he is latiff abdullah showing us that uh the throw ins are definitely one of his fortes not one of his fortes doing a close marking job on zorun nicholich now gets away from heiwich with some ease that latiff worked so hard to get it back a good true ball splitting the singapore defence once again sharin oh a misunderstanding then which could have proved uh fatal to the singapore team and singapore were lucky there the ball couldn't settle again run kindly for sharin abdullah so latiff abdullah in fact uh in fact uhm p n c bargy have decided to play a zonal marking system in mid-field to shut out uh zoran nicholich but it hasn't worked so far i think he's got to send a man on him latiff getting pass anton bravo with some luck but it cannot continue forever and uh that pass of his went astray and c bargy well a half-time talk and uh one replacement really sparked off a much better display in the second half from the singapore charges against johore the earlier match it's preceding match but is he gonna be faced with a situation like this again he's not very happy at the moment sanjay ravi i'm sure he'll be saying in his head that he would have stopped that goal but he cannot fault malek on his uh display tonight abdul malek has been playing very very well for singapore i bet he's the one who's keeping us in this game he's had a couple of fingertip saves and by the post and he's tip to over the ball k l could easily be two or three up by now but for uhm abdul malek the singapore mid-fielders are diminishing in this match at the moment they're almost disappearing you cannot even see them controlling the ball in the middle of the path outside zaid chamail or rather rajid ismail failed to keep the ball in play good ball by nazri to haslim that zuran fought so hard and got back in time to shut out the danger pose by singapore then and as i was saying that certainly justified my claim that the singapore boys are not knocking with the ball around and they're finding it more difficult to control the ball in this wet pitch than the kuala lumpur team are the kuala lumpur team is playing it a lot more smarter by playing either to the feet or if there's a wide open space they're play into the space for the ball to run onto the singapore boys aren't doing that at the moment nazri and the singapore team the players are actually having trouble with throw in as well kuala lumpur have always done well right here at the national stadium the only defeat uh so far in five years has been in nineteen ninety when they lost to a quack singapore squad which included alistar edwards and abbas said then they lost last year and uh uh they actually won last year i beg your pardon they won last year they beat singapore two one and this year at the moment they're leading one nil malek the fans urging the singapore boys on the offensive devaraj to latiff easy for m murugan stopping the ball from going out for a corner kick the roar of uh thirty-six minutes gone by in this first half the singapore team have had nothing to show for and in fact it's kuala lumpur who are orchestrating the better moves at the moment scoring a goal as well as you can see from azman adnan in the nineteenth minute of play amin nasir faced with anton bravo well i'm sure foul amin then a little bit of short tugging which the linesmen saw good observation by the linesmen haslim we haven't seen much of haslim and uh the form that he showed in perak well that's a good ball by haslim harun nazri 
Singapore	to rafi back to malek good play by singapore here they're knocking the ball around very quickly very well rafi oh he's right through it almost everybody rafi ali a brilliant solo run there by rafi and he just shocked us by  word  could have been a striking goal tonight the sabah defender just stood there and allowed rafi to run up there and while he did so well to bring in the ball all the way to the penalty box before losing it that came in the third minute of play almost an early lead for singapore oh with me tonight is garetth nicolee and uh garetth your views on tonight's game and singapore's recent slump abdul malek his first touch of the ball and his counterpart in the sabah goal natalika hasn't had one yet but the singapore boys are dominating the early proceedings in the national stadium good ball once again by malek nazri kannan measured that one perfectly and a beautiful pass as well to rafi and he almost repeated his performance last week in sabah where he got his first goal for the national team good cross by k kannan just a word from header from this guy rafi ali and going by the early proceedings here it's all systems go from this man he's instructed his boys to go all the way out for victory tonight and that's what they're doing at the moment the singapore players certainly piling on the pressure good jump by abdul bohan he won that one perfectly well devaraj poor first touch almost let him down but he's still in possession of the ball he gets it back just as quickly as he lost it down to nazri good ball by v devaraj and it took a good tackling job there by uh number eighteen charles tindy to deny nazri nasir a closer look at the byline and an easier cross into the penalty box so the first corner of the match going to singapore with only five minutes of play gone by garusla nicolich or natolika that's right natolika he's got some work to do now a short one a good one too between devaraj and nazri the cross not very good it's definitely yaruslav's ball decides to give it up pump up front devaraj offside vikay s nair from johore a familiar face right here at the national stadium he's officiated so many matches and uh it's abdullah bohan probably an early casualty here these early moments of the match can prove to be so very crucial as the last few home matches have shown singapore have conceded the early goal they've gone on to concede another one and uh a little later on gone on to lose their last two home matches as well against johore and kuala lumpur respectively sabah on the attack now a look at goal for abdullah ardi but he was too hasty in taking the shot and it goes out for a goal kick to singapore good header only as far as papanathan though and here come the singapore team obstruction on the path of abdullah bohan that's rozali zilin the skipper in the sabah team tonight he's a very hardworking mid-fielder in fact it's from him that all the passes come from for their goals this season so far and mind you sabah have been uh having a good streak in the league they've had four victories and they're somewhere in mid-table planning to add to the victories again tonight at the national stadium they have a chance here norhalis shafik he had nowhere to go vitaslav once again closely marked by amin nazsir poor ball control there it's uh charles tindy throw in quickly taken by nazri nasir a different atmosphere and a different ground surely from the one they played last week in uh kota kinabalu kannan oh look quick play by k kannan wonderful stop here by kannan gochiramun oh he decided to be a little bit too unselfish there he should have taken a putt shot at goal k kannan but he decided to give it a cross and it's offside on the path of d devaraj nine minutes of play gone by singapore dominating but once again leaving their scoring boots at leaving at the early stages of this match so far they're playing with some intensity at least and some vigour that's what the fans have come here to see abdullah bohan getting to the ball before his opponents but he uh he has fails to keep it in play pushing it out for a throw in for sabah and we can see the sabah players creeping in slowly but surely into the game now that's where the danger lies because the singapore players are allowing the sabah players too many too much time to settle on the ball good ball once again by k kannan well shut out that time matu simbowi abdullah ardi henry anjun abdullah ardi this is good football by sabah well broken up to by nazri nasir he put his foot in at the right time once again the strikers from not getting their services and uh that's what we've been witnessing in our last two matches the strikers not getting the services from their mid-fielders it is not allowed to be freed around the uh touch line there abdullah boran who uh hastily came back and had to kick the ball out for a throw in to sabah they're getting nearer and nearer and uh everybody in the league this season knows that the singapore defence have been suspect all season round a lot of teams have been finding loopholes again and again can sabah find another one good job by amin nasir good ball up by nazri to rafi good header down well head well kicked out though by matu simbowi once again matu sim to the ball before devaraj malek superb header by malek kawak you wouldn't expect him to win that one but he was way up before his opponent matu simbowi looking once again for vitaslav upfront but he was denied the ball so it's still goaless between singapore and sabah twelve minutes of play gone by singapore have had one good effort at goal where rafi ali just missed time his header after a good cross from uh k kannan in fact from the early proceedings we see that k kannan is certainly suited for this attacking mid-fielder's role oh a slip up there early morning rain at the national stadium doing some uh a little bit hazardous on the player's part then matu sim this is yanu midle midleslav they've retained him from last season yanu in fact they've retained almost all of last season's foreigners except for michael vana who has come over to singapore mutu sim once again the build up very sure very steady very easy from the back they get a free kick from a very dangerous position now norhalis shafik the offender and sabah have a chance now to take the early lead yuroslav midleslav and razali zilin behind this ball and it looks like it's midleslav to take it no it's vitaslav who steps up oh he cracks the crossbar and sabah had scored so as the old word goes soccer is no use without their goals and sabah have prove it again bobby chua has repeated his one goal performance in kota kinabalu by being the first to latch onto that rebounds of the cross bar after a brilliant free kick tuma vitaslav and after dominating for long periods in the opening thirteen minutes singapore have conceded another goal at the national stadium this time to bobby chua there he is lerking and pouncing it must certainly be depressing for the singapore players but that's the way it goes we need the goals not the domination to win matches once again the sabah defence is so very well marshalled tonight by yanu midleslav he's taking the free kick now he's doing a very good job in uh controlling his players and they've caught singapore offside for the fourth time already in the opening stages vitaslav almost setting it up for henry anjun and uh it's from this guy norhalis shafik where the first goal came from of course gave away the free kick nazri kannan back to nazri good ball inside by nazri nasir abdullah bohan haslim a chance for singapore to draw level haslim harun the opportunity was there but haslim took it a little bit too quickly and the ball just went higher and higher over the crossbar amin rafi good play by rafi ali abdullah bohan oh doing very well in a very unfamiliar role up front this is good play by singapore but in the end the players got into each other's way well done norhalis shafik could he make up for that mistake it's a good cross good jump though by yanu midleslav malek kawak superb play but not a very good cross to match it rafi almost did it look like an inch perfect cross good effort under such circumstances so he's settling down very nicely this uh twenty year old rafi ali and it's uh very nice to see uh two players from the goh chok tong development scheme nazri and uh rafi they've graduated from that scheme playing along each other tonight the fans still very hopeful that singapore would back from this one goal deficit and remember the carrot dangling in front of them now is a thousand dollars per goal if they win that came from a manufacturing company oh poor defending once again by the singapore team but papanathan coming all the way back to do a good defensive job then and a very poor ball up front there but k kannan he should have released it much much earlier razali zilin amin good play by amin nasir malek to nazri well done k kannan to nazri almost getting round this player but still fail oh good play by nazri nasir work so hard to get the ball back and charles tindy had no choice but to put it up for a throw in to singapore devaraj closely policed by matu simbowi good turn though by devaraj a little bit late on the cross but it was nazri who finally crossed it and uh and a strange decision then by the goalkeeper yarusla he came all the way out for it it's certainly wasn't his ball kannan with a corner the fans urging the singapore players on good play this is haslim oh chips back again by abdullah bohan but nobody was there except for gerard pogileo who headed the ball out good one though by haslim harun and we saw flashes of his uh nineteen ninety season brilliance should i say we haven't seen much of it he's had two goals to his credit though this season so far the ball inside to rafi kannan once again he just didn't want to shoot and now here comes a counterattack where the danger lies definitely a foul on bobby chua papanathan now once again let us remind you that the uh sabah offensive force is a very very fast lot and it's so very crucial to counter their speed yanu midloslav they're definitely looking for the head of uh witaslav now but it's abdul malek's ball he comes up playing this very well so hard to counterattack very quickly as well v devaraj good play by devaraj to haslim good ball control oh lost out wonderful covering by yanu midloslav though he came back all the way from his uh position but he took the free kick to cover that malek superb play by malek kawak down to abdullah bohan doing some very hard running abdullah bohan and uh causing he's called in a few problems on the other side of the field the sabah defensive third devaraj to abdullah  deciding to take his defender on defender running defender and we have an offender the form of uh sabah's checkason word  kilan the sabah team just up soaking up the pressure now depending on their defensive qualities to shut out this singapore side rafi oh they're in sixes and sevens at the moment though the sabah team the singapore boys just fail to capitalise on that 
Singapore	a good tackle there by norhalis wasting no time in dishing out the crunching tackle kannan does well and a good challenge by k kannan and a lovely ball spread out as well to haslim haslim is free he's only got a defender in front of him and tocky john almost got in front of his defender and uh got to the ball before his marker an offside decision the lions won't have to raise his flag up when the referee blew for free kick to negri sembilan two singapore players there trying to sandwich the negri sembilan number eleven that was yeo swee hock and he scored a praise of goal against selangor last week sure he will want to add to that tally tonight he's the person on song at the moment and i think that is a message for the singapore players to let swee hock know that we know they're out there looking for goals and we're gonna keep an eye on him a very close eye well negri sembilan a lot of people have called negri sembilan the football side the season the team of discards but i tell you something the discards have proven to be very very successful propelling them to third place in the lead against the free kick goal by k l discard lim tiong kim and the fact that negri sembilan has been doing so well is mainly due to the fact that they're the almost unbeatable all season in their home squat at the parayi stadium good play by nazri he misses the ball finally to malek kawak and to haslim good touches by haslim a good cross in a chance for haslim and for singapore there was deflection with the state of uh saree said and then singapore has a corner that was very good play by singapore they looked very sharp the passes were well hit purposeful and a bit unlucky there haslim a short corner it is haslim to kannan kannan back to haslim getting to the byline to produce the cross which almost materialised into a goal abdullah bohan who has had nothing much to do so far decided to do something with the ball playing with himself there and papa does a beautiful sweeping job for singapore well read though manso sulaiman and that was good play by papanathan manager patrick ang has really fired up his charges up tonight he's told the singapore players a victory and nothing else to save a hunt for a place in the malaysia cup quarter finals rafee closely policed there by saree said the ball breaks for norhalis this pass though well read by sha shariff the referee thinks that was uh unfairly done by norhalis shafik as long it's done in their half he can't afford to give away those free kicks around our penalty box because negri have got two very good uhm free kick specialist tiong kim robert bozic that's singapore's coach and beside him our new assistant coach robert lim p n sivagy he knows how important it is to secure a win tonight manto sulaiman unmarked inside to number six hisham saharuddin it's a goal kick for singapore d sindrum moorthy well many people consider this half-fits wizard to be the saviour of singapore football if anything else he should see to the solution of finding a classic goal poacher we hope to see some goals from him when he makes his appearance in the second half at the moment singapore are on top word negri sembilan but they're still lacking as far as the goals are concerned very dangerous play there by yugoslav goggic playing in his own half rafi with a quick crack at goal nazri who's free trying to give a low cross for d tocky john but it was well read by the goalkeeper said rudin adress the word look nazri nasir and i must say that we're very fortunate indeed to get about eighteen thousand people here tonight watching this game between singapore and negri sembilan judging from singapore's recent run this should be considered a bumper crowd nazri it is a bumper crowd it is a bumper crowd i think uh a lot of them came up with the expectation of seeing sindram and i personally hope to see him myself  word eleven minutes of play gone by still goalless between singapore and negri sembilan ahmin norhalis very dangerous ball back by norhalis shafik abdul malek doing the sundrado now pulling out of his box pama into kannan definitely a foul a punch there a hit by mohammud tufik the negri sembilan right back and they're trying a zonal marking now because uh you notice the negri back fall they're marking these and not actually employing a certain marker on the singapore strikers tocky john a misunderstanding with malek kawak it breaks for abdullah bohan it was a shot for abdullah it was way off target it was they were lucky to get a throw out of that one who was a bit of misunderstanding between tocky john and the uh with the other striker norhalis kannan good play by kannan oh lovely close by k a chance for singapore to take the lead now and waby's first touch just let him down wonderful play good skill by k kannan yes it was good it was great skill by kannan you can see there twisting and turning getting in a very good cross their first touch there and let rafee down that's our problem with our strikers though mark there they're a bit on the small side and with people like uh miloslav lurking in the background he's uh he's european and he's a lot bigger than our players they're not going to win too many in the air it's very bright start though for the singapore side but it's negri sembilan who are threatening now to go ahead it breaks for tiong kim and so easy he just shot rafi ali had ali had to do it there and once again a nightmare of conceding an early goal haunt singapore remember they haven't back they've been defeated by teams who have scored the early goal against them and this time is lim tiong kim norhalis shafik guilty once again well the terrible miss that norhalis he was standing alone in the box you know having uh a wednesday night picnic and he just punished singapore malek had no chance with that one tocky john a foul there in fact uh manager patrick ang i was speaking to him earlier on and he told that he told norhalis and tocky john and he has given them twenty minutes in fact to all his players he gives them twenty minutes if he suspects a drop in form he'd replace them straight away halis would do well to take heed that warning kannan a lovely touch a chance for singapore to score again oh how unlucky amin nasir and that's singapore's best chance so far good save though by the negri goalkeeper said ruddin adress under such circumstances he was blocked his view was blocked he did well to get down to that one he did very well this is a very well worth free kick by singapore that's great play by one of our defenders i think our strikers should take a leap out of uh amin nasir's book and learn and hit the ball early sometimes they'll go in sometimes they don't that one had a good chance in rolling in but credit to the negri goalie for getting down quickly ahmin once again into that one first tiong kim good ball out by tiong kim to robert bossie tiong kim to robert brathe miloslav and a very good ball by miloslav though straight to haslim haslim to kannan kannan did not control that one very well sixty minutes of play gone by and once again singapore's defence have conceded an earlier to negri sembilan the goal scored by lim tiong kim in the fourteenth minute of play tiong kim once again the negri team are just threatening to get another one haslim in the slip up did well to get back though in time to cut the cross out for manso sulaiman our singapore defence betrand has really been suspect all season now haven't they yes they have they've let in i believe that their eighteen goal eighteen yes eighteen goals in twelve the twelfth match and this one isn't even over yet that's a very very poor record there's no excuse in giving tiong kim that much space and time to actually to place a shot in the net a corner by robert bozik the referee it didn't escape the referee's eye then s silverajan of selangor saw that the punch onto the abdomen of uh in fact it's the stomach of uhm amin nasir norhalis he really mistimed his jump against lim tiong kim to nazri he's been one of the brighter players in the singapore team so far kannan to tocky john backing very hard for this one some scrappy play here kannan takes a shot at goal easily blocked by miroslavagogig who's so cooly disposes of the ball k kannan almost getting his name to the score sheet there malek haslim that's being a little too clever it should be abdul malek's ball and old papanathan comes claims it now there's some player challenging by the negri sembilan defender our crowd certainly not uh savouring these opening minutes at the national stadium in seeing the singapore defence concede another goal a foul by abdullah bohan k kannan is down after that very heavy tackle on him by miloslav boggig and uh that ball has certainly depressed a few of the singapore boys bertrand you're right mark they look as though they've lost their uhm sense of purpose they started out very well making crisp passes moving well and all of a sudden they gave away a silly goal which has been the theme of their play this season and they've lost the the uh the the urgency in their play you might see an early entrance of v sindrum moorthy there's uh k kannan is down with an injury we don't know how serious it is but it's miloslav and a free kick for negri sembilan very dangerous but well cleared tiong kim settling for the throw word  hisham bahrudin to tiong kim getting a free foot in a very very dangerous position indeed and once again norhalis was the culprit he's not having a good start to this game he's been a bit rash in a couple of his challenges he's fortunate this free kick is out to the left although there is danger it it's not as having one around the uhm the arc at the edge of penalty box we really don't want to give one away there robert bosiz it is behind the ball take uh a free kick locked it high in the air abdul malin claims it very confidently as well papanathan unchallenged to kannan who is back in the field of play to pathma tocky john a good kick on by tocky john and kannan trying to look for tocky john one once again and that's a little rash on the part of abdullah bohan there came in a little bit too quickly and too unfairly robert bozic he's operating on the left tonight kannan good ball by kannan tocky john has got some pace but can he reach with this no he can't about twenty-two minutes of play gone by singapore trailing by a goal to nil and this is the negri coach yursaf perell and uh yursaf will certainly be more than happy with the start that is uh charges have given him yuroslav very confident but uh very dangerous playing the game inside his own half his own defence a third of that  not a very good ball played out by hisham abdul gani it's a throw in to singapore taken by ahmin nasir and brathe word  nazaree just fails to keep the fall or to kill it with those touch malek good header there by malek very strong one he's running all the way back to battling it out with lim tiong kim in fact he got the better of tiong kim that time former teammates they were lim tiong kim and malek kawak certainly need malek and his uh high work way to influence and spur the boys on abdullah bohan he's clearing that ball and after a very promising start the game is uh somewhat has somewhat settled down and it's become a little bit scrappy at the moment with uh no one team dominating the proceedings robert bozic with a corner for negri sembilan 
Singapore	and as he julius uvay who will come up for his third attempt at one point eight metres make or break time for the indonesian once he clears this height it will give him a psychological advantage of uh on deakin who also has to clear this in his attempt last and final attempt for julius uvay at one point eight metres and he is out he will go out with uh having achieved a height of one point seven seven metres in the high jump discipline in the decathlon event so quite a good showing by julius considering that he was struggling and at the earlier jumps he actually ended up with uh one point seven seven metres could be quite happy with that  word  well they have got the whole day ahead so maybe that explains why and deakin if he clears this it would mean that most possibly he will take the lead in the high or rather de decathlete but if he he fails to then julius uvay will still remain the leader after four disciplines but that again depending on how well domingo kappal fares domingo has of course after the skip this height and uh gone onto one point eight three which will be the next type at dimosius will have to clear but first he has to get over this huddle nope he is also out and he is credited with the height of one point seven seven metres that means julius uvay is certainly a happy man because he knows for a fact that he will maintain the same five point lead over his compatriot after the high jump discipline  word  but i just he was a demoralised man ever since he just failed to clear this height on his attempt for his next two attempts were really a catastrophe according to his standards so the power has been raised again this time to one point eight three metres the two indonesians as we had sus suspected before the start of the high jump elfee knocked out very early they are throwers and runners than jumpers  word  but we will take a break from the high jump for the the the decatheletics to uh witness another victory ceremony this time in the women's marathon and here is the winner she will go up and step up to receive that gold medal another one for indonesia a second gold medal in athletics this time going to suriati marijar with the time of two hours fifty point five minute and she still look very fresh after crossing that finish line two events gone and already four medals for indonesia two golds one silver and a bronze so the second indonesian we see and right after that the indonesian flag will be raised again congratulations indeed to suriati marijar who did ever so well she took the lead and she never relinquish that a very good run indeed by the indonesian the time of two hours fifty point five minutes winning her a gold medal around her neck at the moment a proud moment for singapore next met with a big approval of course and they is not so many fans we have here at the national stadium they got tonight so their voices loud enough to cheer toh soh liang that's a silver medal for her and our first medal in the athletics competition word with indonesia's fourth medal a bronze in the women's marathon so the indonesians have certainly had a very good start to first day of competition oh he uh like the clothes worn by our ladies carrying medals at the moment just behind our medal winners clothes designed by esther tay so another gold medal for indonesia the two golds distributed already and shortly after that we will have the victory ceremony for the word  that is confirmation of the results suriati marijah indonesia first singapore toh soh liang indonesia's mariahlo alatah and uh tying the rest of the positions wynwyn miang of myanmar hasiniah sadaray of philippines  word of thailand and aiai of myanmar  word  of course confirmation of the men's results as well uh word ceremony which we witnessed earlier on nike saridah sagalah of indonesia winning it indelor word  wahidi also of indonesia in second place and third place jirad tikana uma of thailand roy vance of philippines thailand thawit dawonswee singapore's tan choon gee and myanmar's mong mong tar in the other positions from the fourth to seventh respectively but for the gold medallist of course a big party all the way till the end of the game and they will be enjoying themselves even more indonesians have brought a a real strong contingent here you see them just in front of us just below us in the commentary room cheering the team on but their decathletics have uh been knocked out of the high jump discipline and a good jump by domingo kappal who has skipped the the earlier height of one point eight metres and once again he is crossing that bar so easily that height of one point eight three metres  word  and with this discipline he might even close the gap between uh him and the two indonesians of course the points coming about from uh the height achieved the high jump and not the placings still at one point eight three metres leonardo orbligado of the philippines who did very well to go pass one point eight metres this will be a more difficult height for him yeh just failed to clear it he just sailed over the bar over one point eight and never looks likely that he was going to go pass that height  word  so the twenty-two year old filipino will have to try again at one point eight three metres the two bruneians doing very well still in the competition in the high jump leg of the decathelin salmon segar despite having some trouble at one point seven seven metres and has found himself in good stead now at one point eight three metres now a horrible jump there the takeoff was totally wrong and he knew it all the way  word  his takeoff was certainly too near and uh it is all back to square on again for him he has got trouble at one point eight three leonardo is he gonna leap over his limitations now interesting in the uh decathelin high jump especially since you joined us uh a two leaders have failed to go pass one point seven seven metres and that is the unheralded athletics at the moment who are dominating well before leondardo orbligado will try to jump and clear one point eight three metres and we have to sort out some height problems here we will have to go for a commercial break we will join you later  so they have a very good streak running into the seventeenth sea games in singapore in the women's four hundred metres final and the defending sea games champion is in this first semi-final ludang arpinpu  word  once again checking on the line up again ravia abdul salam of brunei of malaysia lane two alina genosa of philippines in lane three and lane number four kin mar que of myanmar ludang pinpu of thailand the uh defending sea games champion and also the record holder at the south east asia at the women's four hundred metres is in lane number five and in lane number noor hanani of brunei word outsider but still could shock the first three and the fastest two losers will qualify for the final tomorrow finally it is a clean start and a very good takeoff by the thai who has overtaken the bruneian ladies straight away ludang pinpu she wouldn't wanna assert and release her strength so much today save it more for the final tomorrow she is a hot favourite to win her second consecutive sea games gold medal and straight away we can see only one clear runner in this four hundred metres first semi-final for the women's she knows that she is uh relax a little bit coming into the final hundred metres chased only by malaysia's ravia abdul salam but it is uh ludang pinpu all the way easing up knowing that all energy would be needed for tomorrow's final fifty-six seconds the time malaysia's uh ravia salam comes in in second place in third place philippines alina genosa in fourth place kin mar que of myanmar and in uh fifth place noor hanani of brunei who has overtaken almost instantly when the gun went off  word  she has just striding to the finish line it has been rounded to uh fifty-nine point nine seconds her time for the first semi-final way outside her record of fifty-three point point four four seconds but she will be gunning for that only in the final and she has certainly qualify for it with this easy run in the first semi-final there you are no expression on the face at all just getting on with the job and qualifying for the big race  word  so ludang pinpu is in good form and she has qualified for the four hundred metres final for uh women and her closest rival in the next semi-final perla balatulan of the phillipines and rama chandran shanti of malaysia and there are three the first three to qualify and the two fastest losers will make it to the final altogether only nine competitors taking part in the four hundred metres race so only one of them will be left out of the final and with the the bruneian lady returning a very poor time i am sure the next four ladies in the next semi-final will just have to go through the pace and run through it to qualify for it uh we have the line up for semi-final number two in the four hundred metres women rama chandran shanti of malaysia in lane three philippines perla balatulan in lane four thailand's uh salirad srimake in lane five and brunei's masita kaymatjumat in lane number six four lanes taken up only malaysia's g shanti here is the lady who might pose some problems for nudang pinpu  word reputed to be in very good form for the four hundred metres perla balatulan thailand's other four hundred metres runner salirad srimake of course the thais are well-known for producing great runners in their sprints from a hundred to the four and masita kaymatjumat of brunei taking up lane number eight  word  and while we are waiting the start let me tell you that the high jump for decathlon for men the bruneian athlete domingo kappal has cleared one point eight nine metres leonardo orbligardo of the phillipines is next but now we await the start of the women's four hundred metres semi-final number two a very good start by the thai athlete once again and straight away she has overtaken mari masita kaymatjumat of brunei salirad srimake with a nice lead closely chased by uh perla balatulan of phillipines and malaysia's uh shanti is making up some ground as well but it is the thai athlete going all the way by herself now here is another one thai race she will come into the last hundred metres all on her own and shanti and balatulan who have been reputed to be in good form but she is not really showing it at this semi-final but salirad srimake is and she is coasting home can she beat fifty-five point nine nine seconds yes it is a much better time than uh her compatriot ludang pinpu in the first semi-first final fifty-five point eight one seconds coming in second raman chandran shanti of malaysia and in third place salirad srimate of thailand so a good time for the thai salirad srimate we will come back in a short while but first we will go back to the studios and pause for some commercial break 
Singapore	they tend to have an over dependence on randy lai which is very very well shackle by gerard danker he certainly think word also good running to teck lan he is left and a great chance now for singapore good break mohammad noor going all the way through it is saved somehow it manages to word vijayan dangerous play by singapore i just for a minute it looked as though mohammad noor aram had weaved his way through for singapore's fourth and his second it wasn't to be a mad in a mad scramble indonesians got is cleared singapore get a penalty corner and at the same time i think we are gonna have a break of play right now one of the indonesians is down injured he is out of the picture at the moment there he is he is just coming in on the onto your screen it is not clear what exactly happened i suppose the picture tells the whole story tayers tobarick the player who has gone down and it looks like a cramp the high intensity of the game i think uh some of players who have by now want to feel some cramps creeping into them well you did say a bit earlier ranjid that the indonesians were slowing down a little and having over dependence on certain players matthais is one of them actually but if we lose him it is going to be a blow unless see what singapore can do they showed a corner they didn't do too much in the first half very unimpressive let's see whether they can improve that a shot there by ibrahim back to steve yes there it is well worth this time good in the nineteenth minute of this second half singapore go four one up and we will see the replay well the initial shot was blocked but it was well played back well taken shot by rosli and it was rosli ahmad who somehow found his way into the dee into the dee all the way from his right back positions it actually shows the determination of the singapore players actually bertrand hah to get into the action it does or perhaps rosli was one of the uh key players on the short corner short corners edwin trying to make his way around got the support of mat noor mat noor will take a shot sixteen yard it says there by no long corner for singapore good try by mohammad noor he got his angles a bit wrong his body was shaped the wrong way and as a result he couldn't get the shot on target but if you don't shot you are never gonna score so it is encouraging to see the singapore players here is dali again going all way and edwin just too wide and edwin throws his stick down in disgust that should have been a goal actually edwin did very well to turn his body around and put it pass the left post and indonesia just can't get out of their own half at the moment singapore mid-field has really taken a strangle hold on this game actually they are playing brilliantly in the mid-field this is a good run though excellent run a chance for indonesia great play by sunny well played there by eugene  word by gerard danker that gives indonesia a short corner that was a great save by sunny and a one on one indonesian player was rusmana number eight who managed to weave his way into the dee he had randy lai free on the left side but he decided to go for the goal and sunny pulled off a great save singapore defenders too quick off the mark this short corner is gonna be retaken and randy lai is poised to take a shot good stop andy takes it stopped by razah well played by razah good touch on by vijan to deny the indonesian captain a chance danger has passed temporarily well played by randy lai obstruction says the umpire it is a penalty corner for indonesia again i think that was good play by gerard danker because randy lai was lining up the shot he didn't have much of a choice he had to step in very well put bertrand let's see if indonesia can do something out of this short corner once again rosdi ahmad too fast faster than the pusher good hit there by randy randy just off the right post sunny was all stretched out afraid word by dali to keep that ball in he has given it to ranjid going back to daljid they have to make their way down the right indonesians will put it to crutch for a free lead to singapore singapore coach graham worth intending to give all players some match experience giving alman koo which word for foo yong guan a run of the game well played by ranjid on a bout word turn and he gets a short corner he will only drop his stick ranji he might have got a penalty stroke well not very likely on that who cares he tried his best but he showed good stick work though singapore is a bit not too good in the short corner department it has stopped good push short corner edwin has got the ball out to ranjid pretty well he is only the hitter suppose to he seem a bit slow in stopping and pushing the ball into the dee ibrahim teklan and it would be a shot at goal great big shot there ibrahim teklan unstoppable but umpire's uh not giving the goal because uh dangerous dangerous play and he did not sound the ball so hard luck to ibrahim but a good shot there though here we see a replay of it tremendous shot look at the power in there right in disallowed for dangerous play singapore using the rollick substitution as their  word pullers good dummy by gerard danker he left it for ibrahim knowing there was no indonesian player in the singapore half this's tah lock it's a break on indonesia the indonesians stopped there by ibrahim he gets a free hit just outside the dee he want to take a shot at goal stopped by rosli this time great stop by rosli at point blank word  the number of times the break out word  they have to use eugene who's overlapping who has held it up now azak sending it out to ranjid ranjid umpire has given a long corner to singapore ranjid takes it to ranjid dropped by ranjid in the sixteen yard hit good defence play by indonesians free hit to singapore will be taken by ranjid singh the police he looks for the top man and he finds mohammad noor well shot his second goal for singapore very good goal free hit laid in good stop by mohammad noor kept his eye on the ball and drilled in an excellent excellent shot the thing about that shot is betrand that he kept his eye on the ball and that was very good of mohammad noor brilliant goal it's taken singapore is fifth vijay trying to play word gets a long corner vijay sends his cross and he finds one of the word  of the day indonesian defenders and singapore end up getting a penalty corner and we have five minutes left and with this lead of five to one the silver medal at least looks assured yes bertrand at this stage right now i think silver medal since hockey will there for men's hockey there'll be only two medals gold and silver looks like singapore will end up with a silver good play there nice tactic indonesians read it unless of course singapore can beat malaysian which right now i don't think many people do expect that uh not not at the world's ranking of malaysia at number nine in the world after the olympics and what more but one never knows bertrand the ball is round like they say malaysia obviously be the favourites but given the home ground advantage and what support we can get from the crowd a draw might be enough i mean think about it a draw with malaysia and if somehow the indonesians can fend off the malaysians those difference might be the key of course the question is whether five one is enough because malaysia obviously they're a much sharper team and could well wreck up a much bigger score against indonesians good play there by word hassan he's pulled it a bit too wide bring the ball out indonesians looked like all finished but uh they might want to try to put in a goal to save some credibility and it was ibrahim teklan again to the rescue caught in between the legs ranjid the indonesians might try and wanna look for a goal right now to save some indonesians playing the ball around not knowing what to do as singapore has got everybody back ibrahim now onto the captain's suranto word  well played ibrahim startled suranto suranto still with the ball  word singh on him bit of a stick tapping there indonesians will pick up the free hit well played talop to read that one word  suhanto now well cut off there by razar word try to keep the ball in play not successful suhanto again he trying to the cross in and give a long corner to indonesia good play by danker all the way down to the indonesian half maybe a hit in for indonesia good play by razak ranjid has it on the right now razak's just thrown the ball wide on the right nobody picking it up he's got back the ball trying to put the reverse touch ranjid letting it go out of play sending sends it to eugene eugene trying his way trying to word his round into the dee and there is the horn for the full-time whistle singapore wrapping up a very impressive five one victory goals by gavin dan royan ranjid singh uh two by mohammud noor adam and one by one roslis uhm were responsible for the five goals indonesia's consolation coming from randy lai both these teams obviously had to face the group favourite malaysia but on the surface of it it looks as though singapore have guaranteed themselves at least a silver with this five one win yes exactly bertrand and uh  and a very good evening to you sports fans welcome to the toa payoh swimming stadium the venue of the swimming diving and water polo events for the seventeenth south east asia games we have just uh began the proceedings this evening and with the march in of the officials and there you have a section of the capacity crowd here at the toa payoh swimmming stadium and we have some real v i ps with us tonight uh none other than our prime minister goh chok tong himself with uh doctor richard hu and doctor yeo ning hong and mrs hu mrs goh as well as mrs yeo and here we have the swimmers getting ready for the first event this evening and with me my co-commentator toto who is also uh at the commentary booth and both of us will give you a uh blow by blow account of uh this evening's proceedings  word  yes uh definitely there is going be a record and uh we are expecting a one two here uh two swimmer uh singapore girls are going to do us proud right in front of our own prime minister joscelin yeo swimming in lane four and adeline lim lim lim in lane number five uh as toto has said earlier joscelin established a new sea games record this morning in the heats in the time of fifty eight point eight five seconds is she gonna better that time and the swimmers are getting ready very good start 
Singapore	and uh welcome sports fans to the toa payoh swimming the venue of the platform diving for women you're watching magdeline wong doing a her seventh dive uh she's already done uh four this morning and this afternoon they are doing four more dives and uh she took it off from the five metre platform magdeline wong coming in uh in the eighth position uh out of eight girls so far in this platform competition for diving and uh not a very good round of scores for magdeline unfortunately and she may uh still remain in that eighth position and uh with me here is uh toto my co-commentator and perhaps he'd like to give you a run down on this indonesian diver coming up well the ten metre platform is a long way up and uh you're heading the water uh at the probably maximum velocity coming in perhaps around well fifty kilometres per hour and uh it could uh do quite a bit of damage if you don't have a proper entry and next we have a a thai diver bumbrunrob an annong uh she is ranked number four at the moment uh she slipped tow position she ranked second coming in for this afternoon's uh round of dives and now she has dropped two positions to fourth position ann onarnong of thailand on the five metre platform oh not a very good dive and uh i think she's not going to be able to even hold her fourth position with dives like that it's a bit unfortunate if you watch from the slow mo replay uh she didn't really make uh the dive completely and uh she was uh rather sloppy coming in into the entry the uh judging has improved tremendously uh from yesterday i was told that two of the judges that judged yesterday have been removed because of inconsistency in their scoring and as a result of which uh we have a better scoring uh at least better consistency among the diving judges and this is uh masophie of the philippines on the ten metre platform back one and a half somersault and uh that's unfortunately an over spun you know in the straight position it's a bit difficult to do your uh uh spins around and uh the control is vital there and uh it's a bit unfortunate but for masophie scoring only threes and threes and a halves and now we have uh the leader of the pack sowani of thailand back two and a half in a pipe position with a rather high degree of difficulty two point nine from the ten metre platform she nailed that one very very nicely and uh that was the most difficult on her repertoire with the two point nine degree of difficulty and and a little bit problem with the focus with overhead camera but nevertheless you could see that uh she did fairly well and uh she will probably win the gold medal in this uh round of uh platform diving for women very good dive from the myanmar diver and now this is the that all singaporeans uh should uh look out for little pearl wee diving from for singapore uh pearl is a newcomer where diving is concerned she's only started training about a year ago and she's already showing great promise pearl wee from the five metre platform with a handstand dive she's suppose hold it uh well there's no really specific rule but you must hold it in a reasonable time and i suppose the judges uh have agreed that uh it is reasonable and uh a very scores there for pearl wee of singapore that's one name all singaporeans should look out for in the uh diving calendar for the next uh few years and i hope pearl will continue with her diving training and next we have another uh up and coming diver representing singapore magdeline wong and she should do very very well in years to come given proper encouragement magdeline from the five metre platform also doing a handstand dive similar to the one that pearl did and as you watch that replay technically they must hold that handstand for a reasonable period of time to show proper control and uh a fairly good round for magdeline wong another name to watch out for in diving and bonwonroc of thailand in the ten metre board ten metre platform going through her motions in her mind takes a great deal of concentration here inward dive two and a half somersault not a very good entry execution was okay it's only towards a masked?? uh half somersault but uh she quit on the dive and coming up now we have uh obiater masophie of the philippines another arms tand dive with a double somersault in the pipe position masophiw obiater of the philippines yes she should get a six and half there five and a half six and a half points here's that replay there yes about five and a half and six and a half point and now coming up uh i think she'll most probably win the gold medal uh sawani of thailand yes uh unless she's a complete fail dive uh she would uh definitely walk away with the gold medal for thailand another armstand dive double somersault this time in the pipe position good control good entry and uh that definitely will win her the gold medal watch the control there very nicely control and uh jubilation in the thai camp and that was the gold medal dive from uh chuck awana sawani from thailand congratulated by her teammates and officials and overall uh that completes the concludes the platform diving for women the winner as we have said earlier on was uh chuck awana sawani of thailand with uh three hundred and sixty-six point zero five point in second position we have dwee marestuti of indonesia with uh three hundred and forty-seven point eight points and in third position we have uh mikchrome myer solisito of indonesia with three hundred and thirty-one point one five points and uh there is a lull now in the diving uh complex uh as we get ready for the next event and that is the men's platform diving and uh i think this will probably uh start in about uh twenty minutes' time you have the results there uhm the thai girl doing very very well uh leading by easily twenty twenty points from second place uh yes pearl uh finished sixth in her first sea games and uh actually the two girls pearl wee and magdeline wong have done very very well uh considering that uh it's been a long long time since we've had uh uh divers especially lady divers in our diving competition and uh let's hope pearl wee and magdeline wong will continue will their efforts and perhaps in the next sea games they should hopefully win at least a medal in the diving competition and uh as we get ready now for uh the men's uh platform event uhm the divers are uh starting to warm up uh for the event uhm there was a tremendous downpour the heavens opened up over here at toa payoh and uh there's a very very happy diver there and with that we hand you back to caldecott hill for more reports on the seventeenth sea games  yes uh unfortunately for eric boheng uh he was expected to win this race and uh i must say desmond swam a good race unfortunately he could not uh master enough uh power to get a lead in the breaststroke it's very important in the individual medley to get a lead in the breaststroke leg because as you finish your breaststroke and you go on to your freestyle leg your opponent is still swimming a slower breaststroke leg and therefore you can get uh uh an easy lead in him but uh uh unfortunately for desmond he just could not uh get ahead of uh of uh rattapong in in the uh breaststroke leg and rattapong is very strong swimmer uh we watch him swim yesterday and uh rattapong is just far too strong for desmond in the freestyle leg and as you can see rattapong just pull ahead uhm in any case uh it was a good swim for desmond and not to take anything away from rattapong who won the event in two minutes zero six point nine zero seconds uh just barely uh breaking the record by uh four hundredth of a second uhm good swim nevertheless uh desmond has to be content with a silver medal in two minutes eight point nine eight seconds and uh sutanto of indonesia in uh two minutes ten point eight four seconds and there you have the official results flashed on your screen i'm very surprised uh with eric boheng uh expected him to do better and uh coming in last when you're defending champion uh a really uh there's no excuse i i i really don't think there's an excuse for that uh i really don't know what happen but uh for a defending champion to end up uh a wooden spoon in the event is uh uh really i really don't know there there could be uh uh more acceptable reason he just gave up yea but that's not until after tomorrow or day after and now uh as we wait for the uh relay event for the women let's uh go for a commercial break welcome back to toa payoh and uh we now have the start of the four by hundred metres freestyle uh for women singapore is featured in lane number four and the first swimmer for singapore is adeline lim and singapore is in the lead adeline now uh you can see in the middle of your screen there's adeline lim swimming for singapore leading the pack uh coming into the first turn and uh adeline has turned in twenty-eight point six nine seconds following uh closely by indonesia and uh thailand indonesia is represented by katherine masulia and uh thailand is represented by johati terongsawat and even and ng chiang ling is taking off the second position for singapore ng chiang ling has gone up and this is going to be a very exciting race the uh record holder for this event is the team from indonesia established in nineteen ninety-one in the time of four minutes zero point nine zero seconds what a race this is very very close race between the three countries indonesia singapore and thailand and they're neck to neck and it looks like it's thailand slightly singapore with uh singapore in second position and indonesia lying third for the moment and uh taking over for the third leg is may wee for singapore actually it's a very good uh best kept secret so far we didn't even know that jos joscelin is gonna swim the anchor until just a few minutes ago they would not release the uh position of the swimmers and now it's uh may wee who has taken the lead over for singapore singapore in the lead uh with uh indonesia it's thailand in second position and indonesia in third position may wee leading for singapore and it's joscelin yeo singapore's heroine taking on the anchor leg swimming the last one hundred metres in this four by hundred metres freestyle relay for women unless something dreadful happen nobody is gonna catch up with joscelin joscelin is easily leading by uh two body length she's just turn for the last leg of this four by one hundred metres freestyle relay for women and singapore's it's going to win its fourth gold medal in this uh swimming event  what a great race by the four girls uh the four girls represented singapore adeline lim uh ng chiang ling may wee and joscelin yeo yes may wee swam a very very good race and uh that's not taking away from the rest of the girls all of them swam exceedingly well and may wee was the one who uh uh extending the lead for the singapore and uh look at that it's just so happy and uh adeline uh and uh and may wee and joycelin and ng chiang ling congratulations to all of them and this is joscelin yeo's fourth gold medal she's got three personal gold medals individual gold medal and one team gold medal

stadium for the jags will see them strengthened and uh their quest will be answered if they can maintain that third spot because they have gombak jurong and as well as geylang chasing them their opposition tonight will be woolands wellington a rather erratic team before we bring you tonight's game this weekend's game let's take a look at two matches from last night both games ended up as one all draws at the uh bishan stadium it is home united against geylang united and over at the toa payoh stadium it's balestier central against sembawang rangers footage)  word are on top with forty-one

dolphins can rise to tenth place if they beat thestags at hougang stadium tonight the last time thetwo teams played over at the woodlands stadium the rams lost one goal to two against the jags so what sort of a result can we expect tonight let's find out more from our match preview footage well it's not a big crowd here at the queenstown stadium so let's uh cross over to our rather lonely two commentators john faulkner and vincent subramanium take it away guys 
Singapore	the start of the second game the first one having been won in handsome style by singapore fifteen to seven singapore on the right side of your screen philippines was a little cynical with its serve love all that was on the line philippines grabbing the first point one zero that went right good save from singapore and that was a weak return i'm half surprised that they can't reach that one it was perfectly set up for the philippines to drive it down to the singapore court so philippines leading one zero well that's coming over for singapore oh no oh that's a bad defend of singapore let's see if they should try to block this one oh yes it's just too easy singapore a little bit unsettled at this stage and let's hope that uh they realise that they haven't won yet let's have a what happened was the oh that short set set up by singapore side very effective for the philippines in this array that was out but it was deflected by the singa by the philippine defender singapore trailing one two and that was a good short set two one philippines for all we should have got that singapore's number two liew teow kah number eleven scaling heights went right on top of the net and force it in between the little gap between the blockers and the net philippines saying thank you very much we'll do exactly the same thing philippines three one that was bad bounce from singapore's ng chee ho and i'm not surprised that the philippines leading four one not by tinge of any spectacular or play from them mind you more because of singapore's errors and the this is a timely call out a timely time out called by the singapore coach chen as uh the score is four one we don't want things to deteriorate any further than this we want to stand uh any chance of getting into the game without a great deal of effort singapore then trailing one four and philippines with the serve right in front of the net of singapore's aubrey ong number two here he is with a short set word nicely by chian lin chong number ten that was kay of uh singapore just trying to do a little bit too much off balance and he tried to to set it up the ball went over the net too close to the and well it went over the philippines side singapore serve still the singapore team and a great deal of oh it must have been too long yes it's way out don't know what kay was trying to do there made a couple of mistakes in a row that's going out as well and the one from oliver balzeh so both teams showing signs of not too very settled but broke off with that serve from the from that smash from the philippines is the is the serve again that's right one four singapore behind it's time they did something to get a few points on the board with good luck singapore could set it up singapore team losing confidence oh that's an effective yes even the philippine player number seven bob malenlub said yes i did touch that before it went out singapore gets a point then two four trailing in the second game wonderful block two of the taller players from the singapore side number ten and eleven chiang yu chang and lui teow kah singapore keeping up three four there you are and it's all tied up this time the philippines wants the to have a substitution in comes roskito word word  there goes oliver balzeh number two here's the new player number six roskito word   word first word to the ball and that was the you can watch here the captain of the philippine team antonio ladimo junior slamming that down oh that was right that was out in the flurry of the battle bob halinup number seven not able to control the ball it's still four all singapore with the serve the red bulls from singapore that was long that was right and singapore for the first timeof this game move ahead five points to four in this set the philippines coach sinthornio  word says okay i want to talk you fellows come up and he gets thirty seconds to talk things over trying to find out what happened philippines was way ahead four one you see the smiles on the singapore teams on the singapore faces five four singapore ahead there is liew teow kah all one point eight four metres of him behind that shot word  ng chee ho singapore ahead four six an infringement from chia min chong of singapore word  embarassment perhaps well that was a bad serve bob malinup he's made a few errors for his side six five singapore fourth set coming on and i said yes and he took full advantage of that there was no one blocking up there rostiko word  kamandian for the philippines putting it other way now there you saw the singapore team taking the the blockers on the philippines side out they meant to have attempted uh pretended to spike the ball and that was word wide and singapore pulling ahead steadily singapore should be able to get this over wonder if the philippines can? oh that's a weak return from the philippines and that's word yes went out the fingers of the defenders the setters word and arthur word and singapore ahead eight five and mahmon with the serve of the philippines number five loo weng hwa he's right on really victory as that went in eight five i think it was long oh no i think touch by one of the players on the singapore side deflected out so philippines get to serve and it's rostiko word  kamandian word  that was a surprising attack from singapore's tay chee keong the setter au puay yong instead of serving it to the front serve it to the back and chee keong was up to the challenge loo weng hwa definitely the live wire right now rallying his team nine five with sing singapore ahead of the philippines and this is definitely not a result that was that would was expected by the other teams in the sea games it was deflected and it was a net infringement by the philippines net infringement by the philippines and their uh their captain arguing and he is going to be given a talking to by the first referee singapore flag as i mention coming out and the well as you can see at the base of your picture antonio talking back to the second referee which you're not suppose to actually the rules actually say that if there're any protest the only people who can actually direct them are the coach as well as the captain and the antonio is actually the captain i don't know what the protest was but perhaps he was just protesting too much well back to play and singapore straying their shots and that was a yawning gap back there which the philippines exploited to great effect they get to serve five to ten oh that's too close to the net singapore hasn't doesn't seem to be as settled as in the first game but perhaps it was the philippines who has began to tighten their game just a little more here we go with uh oh yes antonio antonio word  junior number captain doing the captain's job for the philippines seven ten they're still trailing but singapore not doing what they should be that's a well it's a poor set and in comes tan hai peng and out goes ng chee ho number twelve man tan hai peng the most exuberant player at the singapore side and he's a brilliant player but uh his sometimes his brilliance causes him to make little errors unnecessary ones and the time phauy bao shen with singapore leading ten points to nine in the second game of this best of five game encounter the philippines putting up a much stronger defence as well as uh uh attack uhm i think that this has forced singapore into quite a number of errors and it is to their credit singapore credit that they have maintained their their lead uhm but uh it's gonna be a tight one the rest of this game the players

priceless as he saw that the ball had rebounded and that the philippine that his team could not retrieve it the score now twelve nine singapore knocking on the door of uh of the of the second game and

bringing the first team in chia min chong one point nine one centimetres tall coming in to beef up the frontline oh did he touch it no ng chee ho he's gonna put his whole weight behind that 
Singapore	lim tong hai takes his place the big question once again who will play in the central mid-field position the last time it was rafi ali i think sivaji has kept faith with him and rafi has taken up a central mid- field position steven tan with a ball for singapore played up wide to malek awab van long it is who picks up fandi straight away no foul says the referee that tackle from uh muiyan mun chong of vietnam malek awab gets it back for singapore after a poor pass by rudin tuan fandi against van long van long of course scored against the philippines and this time it was his leg that blocked fandi's cross only for it to go out for a corner to singapore lim tong hai has been brought back and uh his aerial strength will be very much needed for this corner kick hit straight to the near post for v sundram moorthy but it's the vietnamese defender who clears it bin tuan loses it sundram and it's van loong who picks him up again lim ter ang sundram leaves it for malek awab a nice cross by malek and everybody just misjudging a swing of that cross that time fandi once again getting free from uh van long good play by fandi ahmad sundram looking for the ball but the pitch is uh rather heavy it took a lot of weight off the ball then mun chong and van long clears it only as far as nazri nasir who had a blinder against the indonesians here's fandi taken off good tackle by lim tong hai got across very well the pitch is wet and uh really an invitation for rough play here and for singaporeans would not want to get injured if they are to achieve the result they desire and qualify for the semi-finals singapore were guilty of some sloppy defending at the match against the philippines and for a short while in the first half against the indonesians they need to tighten up some squeeze at the back fandi is back here little over-indulgence in the style then in a simple pass to malek would have done much better losing it all out that was rafi ali will the vietnamese have a chance nice little curler tried by lu din tuan their star striker oh vietnam besides the first-half show against the indonesia have been quite disappointing in this tournament so far a coach has put it down to uh a nine o'clock kick off they say that's usually the time they go to sleep at nine o'clock and they will be much brighter and alive against singapore in this seven o'clock game foul on sundram now there's some space ? ? flings it across in nice ball to fandi ahmad who connected with the scissors' kick but not cleanly though and that came after five minutes of play sundram isn't gonna take this of course he's till nursing a hamstring injury but he played very well against the indonesians sundram got two goals in the tournament so far tong hai losing out once again unhung?? for the vietnamese good sweeping by razali said but tong hai's uh weakness on the ground exposed down there quite clearly van mui good play once again by pang hung the only thing wrong is to keep the ball in play there a victim of his own ball control din ter ang nazri nasir showed who showed a lot of enthusiasm against indonesia and of course his shot which led to uh singapore's equaliser in that match fan mui for vietnam now here's dian dung steven will pick him up and does well steven gets the ball back from momentarily loses it again dian dung outside it's a goal kick to singapore well they've they attacked very well down the right flank but they have to watch the right flank as well because the vietnamese are using this flank for most of their attacks too saswa love is over overlapping once sin hian ter ang should be razali's ball and nazri to rafi who loses it in midfield but gains it back sundram nice pass by v sundram moorthy sasswa ? ? for singapore easily tackled then by muiyan man chong good play once again by nazri a rather harsh decision by the referee then he came in very strongly well that's nazri for you a very uncompromising player tong hai does well to clear and all the singaporeans claim referee says play on lovely back field by malek awab and a nice cool pass by steven tan looking out for the runner fandi ahmad fandi does so very well to keep the ball in play magnificent skills by him determination getting him a little further before the ball goes out you can see fandi is a little bit subservient by the close attention he's getting from the vietnamese a ? ? home support it's gone to fandi again though and that shot by saswa went far wide he's drawn in very well with the offensive work saswa dematha?? but whether he's upfront he tends to abandon his ? ? right back same as in the case of uh e mani mohan suan phan van mui good pass tong tong tam a little bit of uh confusion then and vietnam win their first corner via a touch of steven tan eleven minutes of play gone by nil nil singapore vietnam good one real one by steven tan kian dong rafi gets committed himself in very vulnerable tackle by rafi ali it move pass everybody and straight to malek awab good work by mui yan van loong but singapore playing them on side here's a chance for phan hung good work by steven tan though who did enough to uh push the body phan hung aside and narrow the angle for the shot in singapore scored four goals against vietnam in two matches exceeded two as well steven read that one pretty well rafi who scored a solitary goal uh that was a very poor pass by rafi though especially if you're playing in the play maker's role nazri lasted for a short while and to saswa  that's a much better ball by nazri nasir three waiting for the cross from saswa one of them is fandi ahmad but the goalkeeper comes out very well to meet it malek trying to get a first hand cross back inside fandi does very well it's a penalty yes a little cruel on the decision oh no well actually the referee pointed the the cross to them but he pointed to the place where the goal kick should be taken got the crowd a lot of people in the commentary booth were excited for a short while it was a really a teaser by it must be heartening for p m sivaji to know that uh our crosses down the flanks uh saswa steven and malek can knock in very accurate ones a very bad tackle on fandi ahmad that time by mui yan van long they're certainly aiming for his ankle we read about it and uh bin ter ang that's a silly way to get the yellow card really ter hung well a yellow card well surely mean that they'll be a bit more cautious with this tackling and that can only do singapore some good at the moment vietnam have possession of the ball sixty minutes of play gone by still deadlock at nil nil singapore and vietnam a very bright opening quarter of an hour nice little dummy play then by din tuan finding kan hoong back to dintuan good skills by loo dintuan the cut-back though was not just as good onside sundram and fandi chasing for this also with them is mui yan van loong who panicked and just lifted the ball high and wide fandi to malek and then to sundram moorthy easy little ball play outside to rafi and a sensible pass down to steven tan once again malek great what a cross and he gets behind it malek awab the vietnamese claim it was outside but it's the singapore fans who stand up and cheer well done malek awab that's a ? ? coming from the blind side meeting across very well and placing it into the net sizzling effort then six players involved in that sundram malek fandi saswa who made the initial clearance rafi ali who made the pass to steven and the cross from steven was magnificent well good play by loo din tuan who certainly is a more dangerous player bin tuan magnificent skills from him that time the lovely turn around at that time describing him as maradona was certainly apt malek awab who had trouble scoring for singapore prior to the sea games have now got two goals in this competition and the vietnamese defenders are very weary of the two singapore front runners the ball has played nobody was chasing them but they seem to be very apprehensive about you know clearing the ball or just leaving it for the goalkeeper they were in two minds then malek awab a nice ball he's playing a superb match at the moment malek awab he's almost everywhere and he's got the gold as well at the moment the star on the pitch outstanding player he's the oldest the player in this squat and also the fittest sundram nazri dummy taking the back view then distributing it to malek awab mohan trying a little skill from sundram moorthy then but just couldn't do it the vietnamese playing a very tight situation here and singapore ? ? clearing it out but steven tan gave it away din tuan will get to this first before nazri nasir play on says the referee a fair challenge for one thing din tuan doesn't have if you compare to maradona is the size really zian dong good tackle by rafi ali he's run the balls in mid-field fairly well but he needs to redistribute them that's why he's place there by p n sivaji e mani mohan twenty-five year old full-back for geylang international looking for his opponent geylang team-mate fandi ahmad there van mui man cheong ter ang ter ang once again from vietnam this is suan tan easily cut up by malek awab again look at that pace swung there by malek fantastic good work once again by malek awab word a lot of skill in fact it's been him who has been doing most of the clearances in defence and he wins a free kick he's doing everything right this evening scored against the philippines he scored the only goal of the game so far not a very good cross from him though razali said pushing it straight inside thinking that fandi will get at the end of it here is e mani mohan he's got malek to support and he loses fandi again nazri gets to it very well but loses it well won back by rafi and that's a fantastic ball by rafi ali fandi plays it back nicely to malek awab had to push it in between the two defenders who try to get sundram moorthy to it rafi fandi to  vietnamese player taste of his own medicine this is tian dong ter nam mun dong bin tuan the goalkeeper not a very good clearance from him that's a much better that one poor header by saswa finally cleared by steven saswa easily taken over oh wonderful tackle that time by rafi ali but the referee says it was illegal and after twenty-five minutes singapore one nil up but they've given away a free-kick tong hai will leave this one and abdul malek will take the goal kick so malek awab score separating the two sides  e mony mohan v sundram moorthy it's a very adventurious ball by sundram trying to look for nazri then the vietnamese have got din tuan nice little chemistry there shown between fandi and sundram sundram moorthy rafi this is nice football by singapore saswa who look for fandi with the cross they're too many players in front of him there sundram steven waiting for the ball poor ball control by steven sundram again fandi is a little bit angered upfront because they're waiting too long for the cross rafi with a good shot at goal nicely done good play by fandi as well to hold up 
Singapore	and a very warm welcome to you to the toa payoh sports complex for the start of the fourth day of swimming events here at the seventh south-east uh uh the seventeenth south-east asia games uh where the word of prime minister mister goh chok tong to watch the uh events which everybody is waiting for the fifty metres freestyle for men and we have introduction of swimmers here in lane number five is richard sambera of indonesia lane number six is chakasay of thailand lane seven we harold gan and in lane number eight raymond papha ang peng siong exceeded uh the best swimmer in this uh heats this morning he is in lane number four and he should be expecting a good fight from lane three wisneil of indonesia on his left and uh peng siong has shaven his head for this event this is gonna be a very interesting race and off to a very very good start and uh peng siong right in the lead all the way the twenty-five metre mark that's chia peng siong followed by richard sambera and uh and the top of the cream is uh singapore harold gan out to word and it's peng siong yes that's peng siong in the lead in a time of twenty-three point six seven seconds in second position we have richard sanbera at twenty-three point seven three and third position went to uh wisneil of indonesia in twenty-four seconds it is a frustrating race here by uh peng siong whose time of twenty-three point six seconds although has word not broken his previous record is still good enough for the gold medal and that's peng siong with his shaven head winning the gold medal the only events that he's swimming and he has won the gold medal and look at how happy he is with his shaven head ang peng siong the old man of swimming here with a round of applause from our prime minister and also defence min minister doctor yeo ning hong and the president of the singapore amateur swimming association victor goh yong hong and there you have the official result lane number four was ang peng siong in twenty-three point six seven seconds in second position is lane number five richard sambera of indonesia twenty-three point seven three in third position lane number three uh wisneil of indonesia in twenty-four seconds flat and let's watch the replay here yes it was a very close race but uh actually toto in a race like this you really don't really bother about strategy you just go in and if you notice i don't think any of the swimmers took a breath at all throughout the whole race uh they just took a deep breathe at the start and if at all maybe a breath uh halfway down but i don't think any of the swimmers ever took a breath right through well this is a a typical ang peng siong race uh peng siong always starts off very very strong and uh towards the end uh he he probably just uh coast word and uh another five more metres i think uh richard would have uh beaten peng siong but nevertheless yes that's not a fifty-five metre race and that's peng siong this is why peng siong doesn't want to swim the hundred metres because he knows that uh he just doesn't have the uh stamina to carry out this uh uh uh hundred metre race but fifty metres is still very good for him and uh with that we'll cross over for the last five minutes of the hockey game uhm and we'll come back to the toa payoh swimming complex later on  and this the introduction of the swimmers for the two hundred metres breath stroke the second event this evening we've just introduced joselin yeo in lane number one and in lane number two we have sita of thailand now joscelin uh qualified seventh in in the heats this morning that's why she's in lane number one and uh i don't know uh what her strategy is and i hope uh she should win another medal for singapore nevertheless that's an introduction there and lane number five we have duyuen ti pong uh followed by the second duyuen ti pong from vietnam and this is lane number six buwicks buwickshit of thailand in lane number six and that's may ooi of singapore in lane number seven and in lane number eight we have rita mariani of indonesia now although joscelin is in lane number one she will be at the bottom of your screen uh watch out for her because uh we really don't know anything can happen it's the uh one of the slower lanes on the outside but uh well there's four lengths of the pool to go and uh we're expected something from joscelin over to you toto i don't know it's really fabulous uh the effort by joscelin but i wondering while you were giving the commentary let me add the qualifying times uh from the heats this morning you know joscelin almost didn't make it she qualified seventh like i said her time during the heats this morning was two minutes fifty-three point three one and rita mariani qualified last with two minutes fifty-three point six one if joscelin had just slowed down uh by a tenth or two-tenth of a second she would have been out of the finals but uh nevertheless uh joscelin swimming in lane number one winning her sixth gold medal i think it's may ooi uh in sorry it's it's rita mariani in third place rita mariani in third place uhm there's joscelin in lane number one she's extremely strong last five metres as she lunges towards the wall and it's a new record time by the way two minutes thirty-four point eight seven seconds and uh toto this is a typical commentator's nightmare when you have swimmers so far apart coming in so close together right it's very hard for us to spot them and to call them out but nevertheless uh uh the important thing is joscelin has won and what a night it is for singapore the first two event and we've got two goals already tonight first by ang peng siong second by joscelin yeo and uh we are gonna have a replay now of the last hundred yes that's uh one fifteen point six one in the first hundred metres by joscelin you know toto we've got great swimmers uh all these years but nothing nobody has come close to joscelin because she's really an all-rounded you know she swims all the strokes very very well uh we were talking about junie sng junie was very good in in the front corner word of free-style she was good in the butterfly but uh and and that was it but uh look look uh look at this uh even pat chan in those days pat was a a very good uh free stylist but i don't think pat uh maybe where if she hears us at the studio well she she fancied swim that breast stroke because it's it's not an easy event to swim and here you have a truly all-rounded uh joscelin yeo she swims every uh stroke just as well and coming in towards the last five metres of this replay she wins the two hundred metres breast stroke for women and there you have the results and uh let's hear from our sponsors and once again another penalty corner this time conceded by florence as she obstructed the indonesian danger girl johanna with just over ten minutes left singapore still lead by that solitary goal scored just before half-time by delima isa but that goal is under pressure now from the indonesians it wasn't a clean stop and number eleven of singapore ong kim choo managed to clear the ball away that was the third time she's broken up a a indonesian short corner here's johanna dina trying to squeeze her way through she manages to win a long corner that wall was lifted into the dee florence good play by florence she didn't actually make contact with the ball but she forced dina into playing a bad pass hit out by florence once again she's looking into clear range she couldn't the stick johanna was actually obstructing her that ball lifted into the dee so that should be a sixteen yard hit for singapore and they would be well-advised to take their time on this one she finds dahlia dahlia will send it long to melanie was trying to get free but indonesian they pick her up well siew keng well stopped by siew keng she found geraldine who tried to flick it to melanie siew keng once again they're still trying to play up melanie the the indonesian girls packed the dee right there and singapore wasn't able to find the way through well cut out by dawn defol that allows the singapore girls time to get back but i can see a few tired women out there there's not much help from the frontline coming back to assist the mid-field geraldine played in to dahlia and held word it up given it melanie melanie is trying to free delima the ball has foul word its way through swee keng short ball to delima delima's round her man or a woman i should looking for a good cross well cut-out by the indonesians a chance there the ball didn't run right for dahlia very good run by delima that cross caused quite a bit of panic and confusion in the indonesian defence the ball did right run right for dahli though and swee keng melanie  word  well played by the goalkeeper geraldine another chance and somehow the indonesians managed to scramble that one way well read by dawn played forward word to melanie dahlia trying to free geraldine inside the dee there was obstruction so we're gonna see another short corner here for singapore and there's geraldine ho the player who won the shot donna is now going to play the ball back dahlia is set to stop it let's see what singapore have up their sleeve this time a bit over elaborate there the indonesian girls were off the line quickly and singapore have lost the chance to pair that one goal advantage long ball played out here geraldine she stopped it well and this time i see dahlia doing her best to get into the box but geraldine's reverse flick did make contact ball still with singapore though that looks like obstruction yes it was it's obstruction oh that was a very poor ball easily cut out by word  with just about five minutes left and the score is still singapore one indonesia nil both sides have their chances in this second half but neither has been able to score so the solitary goal scored just before half time by dalima hither still word the difference these two teams ball played to melanie martin and singapore has a chance that ball was a bit too soft by melanie well played by geraldine she went a long way back there but she was dispossess lifting the ball into the dee the indonesians have been let down by that particular infringement on many occasions they've had a lot of possession but that final pass has been called lifted into the dee on many occasions melanie good cut back she overran in not having one of her best games melanie martin's with her skill and class nobody doubts there's still just under five minutes well played by swee keng but i think singapore were very very lucky there  one of the girls seem to me had almost trap the ball with her body that could easily have been a penalty stroke but the umpire has given the short corner well charged down so that should be a long corner and singapore singapore breaking out and we are just gonna cut away to give the give you back to the studio who's gonna show you the victory ceremony for ang peng siong 
Singapore	and a very good afternoon to you sports fans this is fong ho beng together with guest commentator toto dermati at the toa payoh swimming complex bringing you live action of the waterpolo waterpolo game between singapore and malaysia singapore in white caps are leading now by ten goals by nothing and it's malaysia at ten goals to one i beg your pardon malaysia just broke the guards about two minutes ago uh towards the first part of the fourth quarter and now singapore on the attack uh singapore has been leading all the way and uh they've got the gold medal sown up uh signed sealed and delivered so to speak malaysia needs to beat singapore to win a medal but it doesn't look like they're gonna do it trailing by ten goals to one and now it's uh malaysia back on the attack malaysia playing from left to right in the blue caps and that's number seven choo keng soo with the ball looking for an opening james tan james tan tries a long and singapore right on attack with number six there aw kam mun one on one with the goalkeeper it looks like a penalty shot high low he was just a little bit too complacent there one on one with the goalkeeper aw aw kam mun and he just could not convert that would be a a nightmare for him for tonight he could have scored that goal but fortunately it's not a crucial goal it may just make no difference even if he scored it or not and it's lim teik yin with a free throw and the cap has come off and we are very honoured uh this afternoon to be uh to have the presence of none other than president wee kim wee and of course uh we are also very very honoured to have our prime minister here with us as well as doctor yeo ning hong you're watching with great interest this final game and goal scored by matthew oh number six aw kum mun goal number eleven scored by aw kum mun of singapore and we are in the fourth quarter of this waterpolo game and watch that goal scored by aw kum mun very nicely done and as i said earlier singapore has already won the goal medal this game is academic even if they lost this game they would still win the gold medal but malaysia has to beat singapore by at least three goals to secure a silver medal and malaysia who's on the attack even with the goalkeeper coming way out to the ten metre mark tiong siong pew being swarmed by singapore defence franklin tan a throw for franklin and number seven choo keng soo wins a free throw and another goal scored by tan kan ghee eleven to two both goals scored by tan kan ghee cap number two of malaysia and the scored line stands at eleven to two in favour of singapore well toto what are your comments so far about this game and malaysia on the attack once again hee ding tiong switch choo keng soo franklin tan tiong siong pew and the free throw goes back to matthew and singapore on the attack daniel wee daniel wee is trying no he's given back to matthew and matthew tries matthew tan the captain of the singapore team scoring goal number twelve making it a round dozen twelve two singapore leading in this fourth quarter of the waterpolo game i was afraid that uh singapore might be complacent uh at the beginning of this game but apparently not there's less than two minutes left in uh this whole wa waterpolo match between singapore and malaysia and singapore is leading twelve to two in the fourth quarter mass confusion in in front of the singapore goal an ejection of matthew tan no it's daniel tan his first ejection for first word  foul lee ding tiong tang khoon ghee choo keng soo ding keong good attempt there by number eight tiong siong pew scoring goal number three for malaysia matthew tan with the ball and being harassed by number twelve james tan fong ho yin the last minute of the game one minute warning being given and can singapore make it number thirteen eighteen seconds left in the goal word and yes number five ho wei meng has made goal number thirteen for singapore singapore leading thirteen to three not much time left in this waterpolo game with forty seconds left and uh malaysia will probably make a fast break of it even the goalkeeper has come up look at that goalkeeper has come up to the halfway mark and they want to try to score another goal but i think singapore is gonna deny them of that and they try to yes tiong siong pew trying very very hard there and uh singapore's gonna let the clock run now i think uh i think less than twenty seconds left and uh that is the end of the waterpolo game between singapore and malaysia singapore winning thirteen goals to three and uh we have a host of v i ps here at this toa payoh swimming complex our president wee kim wee is here our prime minister goh chok tong is here our defence minister doctor yeo ning hong is here and uh we're wondering who is gonna present the medals to the winners uh it will be a little while yet as the players uh uh get together and get ready to for the prize presentation and uh we do not have news yet as to who is to present the medal and uh while we're finding out let's go for a commercial break and welcome back to toa payoh swimming complex as we witness the victory ceremony for the waterpolo competition singapore has done it again their fifteen goal medal in the series they have not lost one single waterpolo game in the entire sea games and seap games series there was no waterpolo played uh at the first seap games in bangkok in nineteen fifty-nine uh there was no waterpolo uh at rangoon for the second sea games but subsequently there was waterpolo uh being played at every sea games and seap games after that and this is the fifteen time that singapore has won and they have not lost one single game now that's a record for other sports to try to emulate president wee kim wee himself is going to present the medal to the winners and uh he's accompanied by defence minister doctor yeo ning hong that's cer certainly is a singular honour for the waterpolo team a proud moment for matthew tan and his boys all thirteen players going up the rostrum and that's matthew tan receiving the gold medal from president wee and that's lim teik yin major lim teik yin daniel wee very proud moment for the singapore players and doctor yeo ning hong assisting the president there's thirteen medals to be given away gets a bit tiring but that's a pleasant task nevertheless great moments for the singapore players they beat malaysia this afternoon by the score of thirteen to three and philippines wins the silver medal a lot of veterans on the philippine team i believe that's one player who's forty years old he's almost as old as i am proud moment for the philippine team as well it's a tough way to get a medal you've got five days of competition bruising word  competition at that i must say the waterpolo matches uh during this series has not been as robust as uh in previous games i've seen players coming up with uh missing teeth and scratches all over the backs and uh torn swim suits but uh this particular series the seventeenth sea games have been rather tame compared to other waterpolo matches perhaps all the other teams have resigned to the fact that singapore are the kingpins and uh indonesia wins the bronze medal in waterpolo president wee doing the honours this is indeed a very proud moment to receive a medal from president wee kim wee himself a moment that all the athletes should treasure for the rest of their lives and doctor yeo ning hong assisting doctor yeo the defence minister is also the president of the singapore olympic sports council singapore national of the council i beg your pardon and talking about that we have a lot of v i ps here mister ng ser miang the president of the singapore sports council is here mister s s dylon the secretary-general of the uh singapore national olympic council is here practically anybody who is anybody in sports is here this afternoon at toa payoh and a round of applause for everybody in particular president wee kim seng for bracing the occasion and the proud moment for the singapore waterpolo team a round of applause here from toa payoh and uh with that we go back to the studio for commercial break to be followed by uh a commentary on sepak takaw by mark richmond welcome to the singapore badminton hall for the inter-regu  word sepak takaw finals the gold medal match between singapore and malaysia the singapore trio of nor hisham adam mohammud rafi abdullah majid and ranji osmund against malaysia's world champions nordin sabarudin arshari hashim and rosli abdul rafman singapore down by ten thirteen in the first word of course remember they dealt malaysia a huge psychological blow in the preliminary rounds where they beat the same trio by two sets to love they qualified for this final by beating the indonesia trio while the malaysians overcame the thai trio in the repeat of uh the last sea games final ten thirteen down the first set and we played thirty-two minutes of this set so far the ball's gone out to illegal grounds and they refused to get now the advantage to two points the malaysians up as many as six at one time they threatened to take the set at thirteen nine but now they're faced with singapore serving at eleven thirteen with me is uh siram ohmar you've seen so far your comments your comments yes singapore started off slow four points behind and then they they allow the malaysians to get far ahead but they've settled down after quite a nervous start they've come back and they've even manage really quite well uh they just called back another point it's twelve thirteen singapore of course one point away now from forcing this just in this first set all the singaporeans were down by four love they came back to join level four all they were down by ten four they came back to reduce it to ten nine they were down by nine thirteen and now they have serve at twelve thirteen so really this regu from them have shown a lot of character helped a little of course by the malaysian word the takaw has gone out at time and the malaysians call for a time out the malaysians haven't really looked very impressive yet neither have the singaporeans to be fair but the uh considering that they are world champions and they have a very good chemistry between them the combination between rosli abdul rafman and the smasher chief smasher shari hashim hasn't been very good shari in fact has missed out on a lot of opportunities to kill the points off and in the block department both sides have had one successful block each yes uh singapore must uh keep their heads together they're only one point adrift they were like you said at times uh more than six points adrift they've pulled back well they've fought well and i think in the back of the malaysians minds' they will be wondering whether they will ever get to see the end of this because they just can't see it to finish off the singaporeans 
Singapore	we certainly don't want to lose fandi ahmad not with only eighteen minutes of play gone by abbas said has uh come down to fandi's mid-field role momentarily and allowed fan uh sundram moorthy to take his place upfront so singapore playing with ten men now nazri well charged in malek kin hong clears it kadir wins it abbas good click on by lim chong kim and nice ball played outside by radi martin kian wee will chase for this he keeps it in play well done paced by saswa nice move onto david fariszuan but malek steps in i must say that the kedah coach has certainly done his homework oh that's a nice sign fandi ahmad indicating that he's a okay and ready to come back onto the pitch of play jang jung is charging in oh nice little flick on by v sundram moorthy a lot of shirt tugging on the referee didn't see it good play by sundram though magnificent skill under the face of pressure abbas said just wasn't there the cross came in a little bit too early but abbas deciding to cross it back again alistair edwards is good on the shot well blocked out that time by lee kian ong but certainly there was some shirt tugging on the part of uh faridza ismail but there are some space now for kadir yahya good tackle and the ball goes out and a throw in for singapore and the referee will have to check on the shirt tugging and all the indecent play at the moment we should call it from faridza ismail he has certainly been pulling sundram back and coming in with very very high challenges sundram turned on and says serve you right big blast at right at his chest don't fool around with me you can't with that sort of service though by kadir yahya nazri will win this one good play by nazri faridza ismail comes in with another big challenge and singapore get their second corner of the evening and they're coming closer now fired up by the kallang roar here certainly the best support in south-east asia and that we can certainly find at the national stadium a corner kick for singapore malek awab will take this one few players waiting at the penalty box ready to pounce and it's lim tong hai wow a goal by lim tong hai magnificent he came in late he ran from deep word and if you still can't forgive lim tong hai for what he did in the sea games i tell you there must be something wrong with you what a goal by tong hai magnificent run from deep word the ball was very inviting hanging in the air by malek awab the goalkeeper came up with a challenge but tong hai didn't care two hoots at all about ahmad sobri he went he banged a header in and what a goal that was for singapore one nil with one twenty-one minutes of play gone by a goalkeeper claimed that sundram moorthy was blocking and he ran up free to the referee afterwards to say that sundram was blocking his view and obstructing him but the referee says no goal kedah attack straight away oh look who's there again lim tong hai fired up by this evening and even more so now with that goal and the singapore defenders covering for each other so well can almost word coming back again in the team team spirit is very high and nazri nasir is on a high himself and some space now for malek awab as the kedah defenders move forward to try to reduce the deficit and get the equaliser good ball in fact sight no support though and yet he's taken shot from an acute angle well a good build-up and a nice counterattack from singapore the kedah players now will have to move up front and try to get a goal back and that will allow some of singapore's ball players more room to move especially players like sundram moorthy fandi ahmad and alistair edwards it's the second goal of the season fandi alistair trying to work something in the air here for singapore it's still in the air the ball's not down yet finally it is brought down by lee kian hong the lion word  take control of things for kedah and kedah players are certainly coming in very hard on the singapore players malek getting it up ought to be fair and to give credit to the kedah coach robert alberts he has done his homework and he has done tried every mean and trying another five singapore's white flank even to uh shirt tugging which they've done on to sundram moorthy there he is robert alberts the dutch coach left to be seen especially in the game against selangor never write a side off just like that least of all kedah mohamud sobri hasn't had very good experiences here at the national stadium that's his eleventh goal conceded on this ground the kallang wave just urging the team on sundram will chase for this good work by sundram moorthy he wins a throw in very smart play oh considering that he's been so unfairly treated by his opponents this evening i think sundram has come up very well to the challenge so far malek awab with a long throw alistair edwards takes it on his chest fires a back kick to no effect though tong hai confidence coming back in him the way he controlled the ball jang jung nice little ball turning defend into attack straight away and look at the time the referee had to stop it but he allows play to go on fandi ahmad with some space now well he was a a little bit apprehensive with a shot at first he decided to take it down word when the defender came to him he was uh a little shaken by the sight of the defender in front of face and just decided to have a blast at goal that went wide radi martin loses control over the ball sundram gets it once again kicked from behind but the referee saw nothing of it a very poor decision coming from the selangor referee and that time for no reason a foul on the kedah player he's called it malek had to come up to clear helping kadir yahya a little bit on his defensive duties fariza ismail very closely watching sundram moorthy game is not over yet for singapore radi martin has the ball and some space now jang jung comes back he has been the player of the match so far jang jung doing so very well in defence he's cut all of the kedah crosses and passes into the singapore penalty area that's his zone and he's taking the real command of it fandi good play despite uh adversity then alistair edwards will try to run at goal good work here by alistair edwards showing nice burst of pace abbas said with oahbumi right in front of him decided not to take any chances at all with the challenge and risk and injury sawas coming back word is so very strong in the air and that time sawas does well malek awab though incharacteristically losing the ball good work by kedah nice one-touch football that finally cleared saban not a very good clearance fandi decided to come in and look at the referee indicating that that was a leg raised but no foul was given kadir will have to clear he does it superbly abbas said now with oahbumi in front of him heels of ball from the nigerian and definitely a foul a tackle coming so high abbas said is really word at the moment working and oahbumi adigon receives a yellow card so two kedah players on a yellow card oahbumi and lee kian hong both defenders that should at least check on their high tackles now certainly good news for singapore alistair does well with a header sundram good screening of the ball releases alistair edwards and hadith martin trying to ease the pressure a little bit on the kedah defender who's deciding the clear the ball and give it out for a throw in to singapore half an hour play gone by one nil to singapore good ball by sundram to malek but malek's cross was easily headed out by adigon fandi ahmad trying to weave his way round to players that dance ended though with a tackle on him kadir yahya and fandi will now come in good play by fandi abbas said has some space decided to take on the control instead of using sundram moorthy a lot of players falling down the pitch is a little slippery and at the same time both teams coming in with crunching tackles they're not allowing players any time on the ball at all a real fierce competitive football game we have here a delightful one as well sundram good ball control releases abbas a first time cross malek heading it back nazri now with some space is he gonna shoot no he tries to use alistair edwards in the penalty box good tackle by lim tong hai here's malek awab fandi now turns no support oh what a pass exquisite ball by fandi ahmad how did he spot malek kawab malek's cross though was a little bit disappointing but the way fandi spotted malek his vision there was impeccable that's certainly good spell for singapore sundram oh the tackle coming in so hard again that's magic for you sundram moorthy a ball inside was actually a very good one cause abbas said made a very late one but well read though by addi boon sawas heading it into space nakitin win chase back and win it but only for a short while i don't know what ng tiong kim had in mind then but he certainly didn't tug fandi out offside it would have been anyway they shouldn't give a ball away in mid-field so easily like what nazri did a reprieve over them because it's a throw in for singapore much to kedah's dismay they were hoping that the referee would see it the other way twelve minutes of play left in the first half singapore lead by a lim tong hai goal to nil abbas leaving it for fandi good work by fandi and abbas nice little combination abbas' ball was uh more strange than anything else jang jung the heart of every clearance nazri heading the ball back to malek awab and uh some trouble for awhile until tong hai steps in to clear and despite some uh good play by kedah in mid-field believe it or not abdul malek hasn't been tested yet and they haven't had a shot at goal so considering that i mean singapore's doing very well defensively especially in particular jang jung nakitin once again doing very well with the jump oh good skill but that finish was disappointing a good play by peter nakitin showing us what he can do on the air and on the ground and he is again on the ball stirring it upfront he knows that his strikers would do the leap ball but with strike falls on fandi abbas malek alistair and sundram we certainly do have a lot of confidence in them some names so long will strike fear in any defences heart oh nice flick by v sundram moorthy sawasdi matha dazuki with some space and room to take a shot the finishing product though was very disappointing jang jung easily done sundram hastily who is quite bothered by the challenges dished out on him this evening sundram fandi squeezing pass two players and releasing malek awab that's definitely a foul and uh a yellow card it should be because malek was on the way to the byline  that should have been a yellow card a foul on any who's brought the referee word the singapore player down off the ball incident and the referee has decided to uh allow radi martin struck free and the kedah player should be thanking his lucky starts for that singapore goal do have a free kick from that and another chance to score tong hai's in the penalty box trying to get his grace sundram alistair as well a free kick though by abbas was floated too close to ahmad sibri no one shutting down lim chong kim at the moment that's sawas 
Singapore	but they shouldn't get nervous like they did against kedah when they had a very nervous opening few minutes and coming running forward straight away is ahmad eusoff he sends the ball outside to uh to zul hamizan good cross inside by zul hamizan ball control and a chance right to one nil for pahang hand ball the referee says no singapore complain it's hand ball but the referee says it's a goal in their very first minute from michael paterson the australian import and uh they came here for an earlier now they're gonna defend with all their might for the rest of the match well taken goal as well pahang one singapore nil and only the very first minute of play saswa losing the ball zul hamid that's dollar salee well controlled out to zul hamizan zul hamizan once again crossing the ball this time zanial abidin was offside he scored against singapore in kuantan aiming to get another goal this evening nazri nasir who shadowed him all the way if pahang will do so again but not a very good start by singapore they came forward looking for the early goal when abbas just pumped the ball right upfront into the pahang defence instead it is pahang who got the early much to the disgust of the national coach p n sivaji ahmad ibrahim trying to unsettle the defenders abbas said came charging in that was definitely a free kick for pahang alison down once again aziza kamaludin azarudin clears it upfront easy for jang jung the fans trying to rally the lions on back into the game they came back at kuantan can they do so at the national stadium sundram comes in with an all important tackle fandi loses the ball in mid-field though michael paterson picks it up outside lack of support assign each other good work with uh rohamizan this is great football by pahang finally cut out by a figure of saswadimata dazuki rafi abbas back to rafi ali can rafi take it on for singapore now he just stopped the ball had actually gone out before alan davidson came in with the sliding tackle to prevent rafi ali from moving forward jang jung will have to chase with all his might against uh a guy who scored the f a uh malaysia cup final goal last season for pahang johamie zann da paria he created a goal for michael paterson and i see pahang word must be very happy with the start he came in with a defensive line up preferring to drop his top-scorer jose and right now that defensive line up will certainly be very useful and and important to this side ahmad ibrahim took word on to that abbas said pass kadir rafi nazri clearing his clearance that time kadir yahya trying to chase for this abdullah malek left to support and finally gets the ball yes he clears it first time thought there is no support danguh here they cannot play it inside their defenders third with that form you are right jamie they're taking uh quite sometime to settle down they haven't really found their rhythm yet saswadimata dazuki trying to hand word mid-field uses nazri nasir upfront only abbas said doing the running ahmad ibrahim is static at the moment abbas couldn't do anything about that malek knows the size but still run the ball sundram will have to get sundram into the thick of action kadir yahya slips off the wrong moment rafi ali will pick it up in field he's got sundram asking for help poor pass though by rafi ali jang jung comes in with a fantastic tackle there and the singapore defender rafi paced once again there by michael paterson abbas said great tackle by alan davidson fandi it's a little bit messy for singapore in mid-field fandi ahmad though he loses his geylang team-mate ahmad ibrahim will try to get over him he's got a few players waiting for that  word cross it goes to a pahang player though rafi ali picks it up in mid-field now for singapore plays it wide uses kadir yahya still the players waiting at the penalty box across alan davidson comes to cover edmund seized a corner with the first corner of the match going to singapore six minutes of play gone by malek awab word  there and it's totally unimpressive from a score line still stays at one nil pahang lead they've got all their eleven players back at their own half defending their singapore goal and singapore will win a free kick for that close by word  on v sundram moorthy for singapore also had the first free kick of the match kadir got some space now can he pick his spot he tries it and just missing by an inch abbas said i think it was just missing it a little bit and kadir yahya's drill inside the penalty box was almost very very effective good work then by saswadimata dazuki winning the ball over to dollar saleh sundram to zanial then ahmad ibrahim that was definitely a foul by osami jalial referee coming up to warn him actually uh pretended that he didn't hear the whistle go at all saleh word that just and now osami malaysian international giving away yet another free kick for singapore sundram once again drills it low ahmad ibrahim tries to flick it on no one there though rafi ali has a chance to shoot word  the action still goes on though inside the pahang half malek awab as he goals it across and the goalkeeper gathered it very easily but a fantastic cross though by malek awab ahmad eusoff former team-mate fandi ahmad in close proximity jang jung steps in with a clearance but nobody upfront though to lend support alan davidson goes word to the best foreign player won it hands down last season guiding pahang to the double malaysia cup in the semi-pro division one league title sundram stepping the pace up for singapore just now his first touch just led down v sundram moorthy to be fair to him it wasn't very easy to control the ball not when the defender kept breathing down your neck tapping his ankle but he made the move he built it up he stepped the pace up a little bit fandi ahmad continues to run and almost ended up as a goal for singapore asa rudin zanial winning that header over nazri nasir nazri up to fandi wonderful touch by fandi ahmad alan davidson though twills it easily and as easily as  word i must say he spotted his player just one touch of the head zanial trying to set up rohami zann danger's not over yet ahmad eusoff collects and passes ahmad eusoff now once again few players waiting in the box one of them is dollah saleh zanial trying one to dollah dollah gets free from nazri for a short word  he flicks it up and abdul malek had to scratch p n sivaji came storming out of his bench when he saw that and this is why he was so pissed off ahmad ibrahim to malek header down by alan davidson again malek though wins it over zanial abidin releases abbas said who switches play nicely over to the right sundram moorthy has the ball sundram has got a defender in front of him decides to take it on checks but kadir yahya in support loses kadir cross come in not a very good one though fandi brings it down very well word malek easy for the goalkeeper we've played thirteen minutes on the match pahang lead singapore by one goal to nil the goal scored in the very first minute of play by michael paterson and ahmad eusoff the word to this pahang side being warned by the referee over that tough of hard challenge from behind on fandi ahmad jang jung sundram nice touch by v sundram moorthy receives it back from kadir plays a one two with fandi almost worked out kadir here has a chance to word ball back comes out sundram wins a header very well fandi ahmad can he do another word for pahang he did it against uh at kuantan he almost did it again nazri nasir loses word responsibility against zanial abidin jang jung though was there good play by jang jung well-covered ahmad ibrahim opening out loses the ball momentarily fandi well picks it up kadir yahya with a lot of room right now on the right flank running down all the players go inside the penalty box waiting for it and look how alan davidson read that one anticipated it so very well just stepped in took control and now he has the ball releases zanial abidin once again squeeze in from uh nazri but shows rafi too much of the ball this fandi ahmad saswa the afternoon downpour not helping him at all regaining his balance kadir sundram malek has got some space now malek kawab the pass there to abbas said it's a little too far ah lovely play by alan davidson once again abbas said he's beaten by his australian compatriot one nil still the score and that davidson move certainly sums up the match so far and he has certainly been the key figure nasir rudin pumps it up upfront it's for dollah saleh beaten to it by saswadimata dazuki jang jung sundram it's time to turn looks up for support finds it in the figure of fandi ahmad fandi couldn't get anywhere though trying to actually go round the pahang middle instead of uh using the flanks which they have done so effectively all season round oh great play by v sundram moorthy word  himself there sundram finds some space can he find the angle for the shot ahmad ibrahim would have made a great return if he had connected cleanly the crowd had sense that v sundram moorthy actually took a shot instead of playing inside for abbas said what do you think jamie at the moment ahmad ibrahim has gone down to take uh sundram moorthy's right mid-fielder's role and uh sundram has gone up to corner abbas said upfront so even the pattern of play in the singapore side at the is missing definitely a foul not spotted by the referee and i think he's gonna give the yellow card to uh asimi dalliel mo well he reached for his pocket and thought twice about it isn't as bad as his earlier tackle on v sundram moorthy and as we speak abbas said in fact has taken over sundram's place on right mid-field and sundram has partner ahmad ibrahim upfront fandi a free kick inside to v sundram moorthy who escaped from his mark momentarily but a good tackle then well recovered osami jaliel sundram though forces the corner the second of the match for singapore the fever though building at the national stadium they took quite a while to come back against pahang in kuantan can they do so a little quicker in this match malek decides to keep the ball in playing across though easy for alan davidson fandi ahmad builds it over again well saved by the defender kadir yahya will have to use saswadimata dazuki the pahang players push up very quickly but rafi ali though oh the ball had only gone out not a very good first touch by rafi as you'll expect for a team down by a goal to nil jang jung misses the header danguh now nazri nasir has got imposing figure of zanial abidin who screened it very well malek there did the sensible thing not blasting it against uh azizul kamaludin the player who has replaced jose ariateh and he throws it all the way back to the other malek goalkeeper abdul malek  well he certainly must be feeling very unsettled abdul malek before he could even have a catch a glimpse of the ball he had to pick it out from the back of his net fandi down to malek again sundram moorthy is racing for that alan davidson is there hits it out only as far as uh ahmad ibrahim does well to turn pass the player saswadimata picks up the loose ball loses jang jung rafee good work by rafee ali up by kadir yayha though abbas said and kadir yahya both with different roles then zanial oh lovely click on ahmad eusoff letching onto this one but look who's there again jang jung kamaludin this is azarudin passing it he knows zanial is there so jump a part of his all those headers abbas said trying to defend kamal zahamizan good tackle by rafee ali and then by ahmad ibrahim alan davidson good pass by davidson and finally singapore word rafee ali giving it back to jang jung malek has got some space now in mid-field decides to use v sundram moorthy we're seeing more and more of this number eighteen now from singapore kadir yahya up high the cross was low and not very good and swung outside rafee to jang jung good play by rafee ali jang jung holds that up for a little for the players to come back keep themselves on an onside position fandi trying to goal ball by himself good work there by fandi ahmad and good save by malek mohammud confidence restored fandi ahmad and after the goal scored against pahang that was his first goal in five hundred and thirty-two minutes of football it's one record which uh fandi ahmad he holds a lot of record 
Singapore	residents of ulu pandan and friends we are coming back again to ulu pandan after the last general election what do we find we find that the pap is on the defensive this time never before has the pap been on a defensive in any general election but they are at this particular point of time why because the sdp has adopted the right strategy we have called upon the other opposition parties to field less candidates so that to make this election a by-election we have the by-election effect and as it turned out on nomination day the pap had 41 uncontested seats and there are 40 seats for the people to choose their credible opposition from so you understand this it is not a step backwards it is not a retreat on the part of the opposition it is in fact a strategy that we have adopted and the pap now has got no answer to it because now they are at the mercy of the electorate the electorate can vote credible opposition at their choice what is a by-election what is a by-election a by-election is an election when even you vote all the opposition they can never come to power because there is already a government a government is already in power that is a by-election so once the pap is in power after having got the 41 seats we consider the balance of the seats are contested as a by-election now this is our strategy and it is the right strategy as has been mentioned by guan yu keng this jayakumar and all the other pap members have trying tried to dismiss the sdp's strategy but they cannot jayakumar has said what is this that this strategy is about he says that the people wants to vote in a good slate of pap mp because of this strategy mr chiam said ask them to vote the opposition and then what happen if they vote the opposition he says that it would be a vote for the opposition and it would a vote against the endorsement of mr goh chok tong he says this will send conflicting signals but i do not see it at all i think mr jayakumar has got it all wrong himself the fact is that since 1984 or maybe earlier the electorate of singapore has seen the harsh policies of the pap they have seen how the pap take money from the people with all kinds of means they have got a social problem and they use the social problem to get money out of it they have a social problem of car congestion and they thought in fact they have taken advantage of the car congestion and make plenty of money out of it you know and i know they have got car import tax they have got arf now we have got coe we got high registration fee we got parking fee all kinds all added up not only car owners suffer but of course if we are business people so the people are quite fed up and they want opposition this is what the people want they want opposition but because opposition for the time being is weak they are not confident they don't want to vote the opposition into power but they still want the pap to be the government but they want substantial strong opposition to check the pap and this is the real feedback from the ground it is not that the people want to vote the pap actually they don't want if they can help it if there is a good slate of opposition they would throw them out of office out of the government if there are but that will be another day for us so that is the true reading of the ground the people want opposition substantial opposition they want the pap to be in power and so now we have given what the people want a by-election you can vote as many opposition as possible and when you vote the opposition it is not a conflicting signal this is the correct signal to the pap you have to vote more opposition strong opposition not only to establish opposition in parliament make opposition part of our political culture not only that but also an effective an effective hammer over the head of pap if you don't do that what will happen you can bet your last dollar after this election prices will sure to go up the pap now tells you that the issue is medifund edusave and whatever but don't believe a word of it you want to ask them what is behind all these issues that is more important it is not the front issues it is what is hidden behind they haven't told you that is more important because you remember in 1988 what were the issues the elected president they say only to take care of the reserve and then we have got the town council they said oh if opposition come in the rubbish heap will go two storeys high all untrue those were the issues but they then did not tell you that in fact once they get elected with a majority strong mandate the other issues are hidden behind as price increases mr ling how doong our chairman and candidate at bukit gombak now you know what happen after the 1998 election it was only held in september the 1st about not three years yet you know what happened of course immediately after the general election your hdb car park from 25 to 50 dollars we have got hefty increases in medical and hospitalisation fees so now you better watch out if you get sick you better make sure you have money in your pocket otherwise you cannot afford to get sick you can afford to die but you cannot afford to get sick hefty increases in school fees for independent schools hefty increases in university fees the poor taxi drivers who were always supporters or many of them were supporters were supporters of the pap have now got to pay 7007 for their diesel tax everybody is fond of watching tv your tv license also gone up so these are the issues which they dare not tell you yes all sorts of taxes not only pub tax and in the case of the elected president once the law is made not only the power to veto the use of reserves but in fact they have got a whole host of other powers in fact the elected president has so much powers that when he really functions i think the prime minister will have a tough time in doing what he wants to do so that is that that is the thing i think all singaporeans know of today now what is the main issue in this general election the main issue is not giving a resounding mandate to mr goh chok tong that has got nothing to do with you what is important is this general election is whether you want a strong opposition in parliament that is the issue remember that and as far as sdp is concerned we don't bother about what goh chok tong wants we not we are not bothered whether you want a big endorsement whether he wants a strong mandate that doesn't not concern you how does it benefit you if he gets a 100% mandate how does it concern you in fact he will have more power to impose more taxes it does not benefit the people of singapore at all they have already the mandate they have got 41 seats they are in power so that question is entirely out you are not concerned with it at all when he talk to you he says that the issue is myself you say you just forget it don't worry the worry the worrying thing is that whether there is strong opposition in parliament because it is not only for the long-term interest of singapore but it is directly for your interest directly for your interest the more opposition you have the less the pap has power on you it is a direct proportion the more power the pap has the more they can tax on you they can do whatever they want in order to get the pap power down you must have a balancing power of more opposition and this is a very important message and we want the people of singapore to understand this we in the sdp has taken the trouble to reduce our own number of candidates to make sure that we have a by-election effect what happen on nomination day if there is 41 opposition candidates standing for election and pap 40 we will take the trouble to ask one of our members to come back down let them have 41 that is the way how we feel so strongly about our strategy because now you can vote in the opposition member you want to vote for a long time and that is the true feedback we get and today i'm here to support mr ashleigh seow you cannot get a better candidate in ulu pandan than mr seow he is a highly qualified man he has got a b.a. honours degree in public administration from the university of western australia he has travelled widely he has travelled widely in australia in england in europe and he has got a lot of international exposure he is a mature person and not only that he has got the benefit of hands-on experience not only in running a town council but also in setting up a town council we in potong pasir we have a town council which we run ourselves we don't neglect our responsibility we do it ourselves all the responsibility we bear on our shoulders we don't chuck it to some professional managing agent to do it for us like other pap town councils so mr seow has seen the setting up of the potong pasir town council before it was formerly come into operation we had the ground work laid see that all the paperwork was right we have to engage staff we have to send the staff for training he has to organise well that is how he is only known in potong pasir so he is the right man for you because at the town council here he will make sure that it no only functions well but perhaps functions even better than potong pasir as you know because we did it ourselves we have a lower cost and we need not raise the service and conservancy charges we did not do it we did it only after 15 months 15 months after the hdb first raised their service and conservancy charges we were able to hold back and 9 months after the 1st pap town council raised their service and conservancy charges so the issue of the town council now is never brought up by the pap because potong pasir town council the performance at potong pasir has silenced them once and for all they cannot go around like the 1988 elections threatening people if you elect an opposition mp he may not be able to run your town council the rubbish will heap up to the second floor your corridors are not swept the prices of your flats will fall these are all not true because we have proven it at potong pasir if you try to but your flat in potong pasir you probably have to pay more than in any other including but more importantly is not just the cleaning and keep the place clean that is with efficiency of service that is probably the easy part the most difficult part is how to build it into a community how to build it into a closely whole and how to get the people at the constituency to do things for themselves and be proud that we are the people who are really in charge and not the pap  and we show that we don't need the pap people can do things themselves that is the more important function of the town council and we at potong pasir may try to do what we preach we have the town council which are representatives of the residents there are 4 total or more who are non-sdp members and therefore our town council unlike the other pap town councils we are not political i am the political representative there anytime can be outvoted because they have the majority i am not worried because i know they are residents they care for their own town potong psir town they care for their own surroundings they were only to make sure that things are correct for the town so the issue of town council is never brought out again although they say that it is explicitly going to be an issue of this election now i think we have put the pap on the defensive you can see goh chok tong is already retreating at first he came out very strongly and say unless i get an endorsement i may not have the power or the ability to implement edusave and medisave and the people and opposition gets more firm as the people understand the strategy of the opposition the people understand that they can vote in more opposition this time goh chok tong he's afraid now you can see he report in the papers oh no no even if i get a weak endorsement i will still implement these policies and because of the onslaught of this good strategy he can't think properly for a prime minister what is he saying he says that in fact it was stated by bg lee he said that if the opposition wins 40 seats possibility is there a possibility of the win of the opposition win 40 seats then it will be a weak endorsement for the pap and goh chok tong goes to say that if the opposition wins 40 seats then it would be not an endorsement for his leadership and he will step down do you know that marine parade is a contested constituency they have a opposition contesting in marine parade if the pap lost 40 seats goh chok tong will have lost his seat he will not be in parliament he will be kicked out he cannot step down he will be kicked out i'm surprised that mr goh can make such a mistake not realising that his own marine parade is contested a contested seat there it is not a question of if it is the pap lost 40 seats it is not a question of not endorsing his leadership in fact they don't want him even to be a member of parliament now my last duty here is to appeal to all of you residents here at ulu pandan if you are staying in these flats please tell your neighbours who are not here your relatives your

Singapore	dear friends and residents of ulu pandan the peoples' action party is very fond of introducing candidates with high paper qualifications they will introduce doctors architects and engineers and what-have-you but they have failed to realise one very important thing not everyone with a high qualification can be a good politician simply because it is not only the paper qualification that make you a good politician the pre-requisite of a good politician is one who is responsible to his own conscience and we adopt our system from england now in england members of parliament would vote against their own party if it is against their conscience but not in singapore in singapore i will tell you one thing no matter how qualified they are they are considered political cripple they are political handicap now what is the use of you standing a gp candidate of parliament when he cannot do your bidding they are supposed to be your representative but in parliament they represent the peoples' action party not you therefore you must always consider this factor when you vote for member of parliament you won't the only people that can effectively be members of the opposition in parliament would be the opposition himself the peoples' action party has declared their manifesto and the next lap now to give you in order to give you some insight of what is in store for you in the next lap let us consider the vision and pap has told you in 1984 election the vision of 1999 now they are they are saying that we are going the next lap what have they done so far that affect the life of the middle and the lower income group in the past since 1988 you have seen the government imposing tax taxes fees levies at a short interval of a few months you will note you have noticed the car park fees have gone up television fees have gone up taxi diesel tax have gone up car prices of motorcar has gone up diesel petrol has gone up and hdb flat has gone up the list goes on i don't have to tell you i'm quite sure you know what they are now having known the power of the pap you will know what is in store for all of you in the next lap the people's action party has already passed a law in parliament to impose consumption tax on all of you they need only to gazette the item in order to put them in practice are you aware of consumption tax the consumption tax will the tax on the daily necessities of what you and i would use shoes clothings food drinks everything under the sun they will i would i can assure you if you give them more than the 41 seats in parliament it would be considered as an endorsement for them to carry out this in other words they would really introduce consumption tax sooner than expected you see the when we critisises the government for increasing the hospital fees medical charges the fees for education they came up with the idea of edusave and medifund mind you they have not given any details of what will be the edusave or the medifund we do not know it came out it sprang a surprise by telling you that they will look into these things my answer is a simple one don't tell us edusave don't tell us medifund reduce the charges of more hospital fees and ward charges reduce the fees for independent schools and for the university i have said it last night and for the benefit of those who have not hear me i will tell you again and you tell me whether it is a fact that the government has subsidised us in respect of medical charges or ward charges very simple one i am sure everyone of you here is aware of this now when you have a cold or flu or cough you go to a private clinic here you see a doctor here how much you pay for the visit 10 to 14 dollars you agree with me you go to singapore general hospital you go and see a doctor there how much would you pay consultation is 12 dollars with medicine is about 15 dollars almost the same where is the subsidy where is the subsidy you tell me first i want to find out where is the subsidy are you telling me the private clinic are also subsidising us also and for the ward charges let me tell you i have checked with the private hospitals here they are providing a three-bedding ward with air-con colour television and private telephone and they are charging 145 dollars a day and you know how much they are charging at the singapore general hospital i won't talk of the who is charging 220 dollars the singapore general hospital is charging you 140 dollars and with something added in 175 dollars no air-con no colour television where is the subsidy where is the sudsidy you tell me first unless the private hospitals are also subsidising us and mind you the private hospital can charge us 145 dollars a day i think they must have made 20 dollars in other words their basic cost is only 70 dollars and you must always remember this factor a private hospital is put up with a tremendous investment by individual who would suffer loss if the hospital has no buisness they would have gone bankrupt and they are charging us a cost of 70 dollars what about the general hospital and the kandang hospital who build the hospital who fund all from our money taxpayers' money therefore if a private hospital can charge us 145 dollars the government should charge us 40 dollars because private hospitals' cost is only 70 dollars and if government charge us 10 70 dollars 40 dollars they don't subsidise us much because hospital has been paid for by our taxpayer money you ask your mp whether they can answer me it's simple simple arithmetic we don't need to go to the university to acquire you know a degree in mathematics simple arithmetic you get the answer where is the subsidy absolutely none and the government is telling all this while they are being subsidising us this is the type of government we have they tell us a lot of things they juggle the figures and that's it and one more factor you must always remember singapore is only interested in the intellectuals those people of intelligience not merely graduate they want the best of the graduate the president's scholars they are only treated with respect the rest of the rest of all of us here who are not president's scholars are considered in the eyes of digits we are digits this is what happen in singapore and you must when you cast your vote always remember this how shabbily all of us have been treated all the middle and the income group have been treated it is easy for the minister to increase the fees because the prime minister is being 49000 dollars a month and the ministers are being paid 31000 dollars a month who has been in singapore between 400 and 450 thousand people earning 1000 dollars a month this is the difference in the pay of the ministers getting and the people getting here you know they have been telling people oh people in the private sector are getting much more than in the government service then resign go into private practice nobody is forcing you to be in the government service if you want to be in politics you must always remember one thing in politics it is always sacrifice and more sacrifice and you must remember they ahve increased their salary and pay once there is nothing to stop them to increase their salary again because there is no control over how much they can get if they like it they just increase the pay and you must also remember half the workers in singapore is getting only 800 dollars a month after cpf deduction the take-home pay is a poor thing 650 dollars a month can you afford to send your children to independent school charging a fee of 200 dollars a month can you afford to send your children to the university take up medicine or dentistry paying 10800 dollars a month this is the government that really look after you these are all facts and figures let me sound a ward of a word of warning for all of you if the pap on the 31st of august take the other 30 seats don't say 40 seats get another 30 seats it is considered as an endorsement for what they have done because they have done exactly that in the past they say there you are you know the elected president we said you must hold a referendum they say no need to hold a referendum because at the last election opposition has been talking of an elected president and you have voted us in you have in other words indirectly endorsed the elected president so they will be adopting the same stance when you come the next general election therefore because they are always going on what your votes they use your votes as an yardstick to measure whether you endorse their policy or not and you know i i'm really surprised it really shows how desperate the pap leadership is now they they have told us in the past before the introduction of the bill in parliament of elected president they say we want the elected president to prevent opposition from squandering away the national reserves they said national reserves are meant for emergency now you have just heard mr goh chok tong telling us he's going to use the national reserves for edusave and medifund where is the emergency is there any emergency this is the double standard we get from the pap leadership when they use the money no need emergency when they use the money they are not squandering away the money but when we use the money they say we are trying to squander away the money it takes a bigger thief to catch a thief you know you they must have thought that they themselves are capable of it that is why they think we are capable of doing that we opposition are a different category of men and remember in parliament so far you know i look at parliament seating now it's a melodrama it's a melodrama because you find the member of parliament of the peoples' action party full of sound and fury signifying nothing and have you seen a member of parliament vote against any motion in parliament they make a lot of noise wasting public fund wasting our time wasting the television time for what for nothing for nothing if you want genuine opposition in parliament only opposition party can provide and we have put up a credible slate of candidates nine of us put us in we will show you what real opposition is about we will be your voice let me tell you this if lim boon heng were i will vote against the government and represent the people i will step down i will support him ask him to think about that i will be prepared to step down it is impossible therefore you people must always remember this when you go to the poll on the 31st of august because it involves your future it involves your children's future i know most of you here are very comfortable you have got a house you have a roof over your head you have got a car you can go on holiday every month but please your children may not be as successful as you are your children may a tertiary education but by then the competition will be so keen they may not do as well as you are  you must be able you must do one thing and you must be able to look into children'eye and say i have done my best people know in singapore we have been doing 200 persons suffering of kidney ailment very month every year they are without help and you must remember kidney ailment we do not know the cause neither can we prevent it but anyone of us here who get it and don't say oh i'm healthy now but once you get it it is going to be a triple blow to your whole family and your children may get it we must fight for these poor people they get this disease through no fault of theirs they get kidney ailment not because they drink not because they smoke not because you know they do things and hurt their own health no such thing people have got no heart this is your opportunity if you want your voice to be heard if you want the pap to respect you they are coming to you now shedding crocodile tears begging for you to put them give them a full mandate but mind you once you do that you will have to suffer another 5 years and by then it 's not going to be the next lap it will be your collapse thank you 
Singapore	uh uh thank you susan can you hear me oh dear i my first of all a level of apology i held everybody up the tra traffic was really heavy along the way uhm my first uh and initial and at a journalist gut responses say it doesn't help and we don't want a standard singapore a dictionary of standard singapore english i say this because uhm i have a i've got a very big title for a very difficult job in the newspaper and basically i was brought in there to deal with all the language problems that the editors could not handle and didn't have the time to handle and didn't want to handle which is why uh reporters especially young reporters always making grammatical mistakes and in the newsroom everything goes under the label of grammatical whether it's lexical whether it's anything else at all it's grammatical so uh i'm there some kind of arbiter telling people that this is okay that's not okay and uh this ought to be better etcetra etcetra so in a way i'm a setter of standards but i feel very uhm uncertain about my role very ambivalent cos' on the one hand uh you've got a scholl of thought there which says that it's got to be very standard which by very standard they mean british english for example we have an editor or they think they they they they think what they want is no they want what they think is british english which may not be standard british english we have an editor who is uh quite old fashioned who is very good writer who is a lover of the word and uhm who also objects to things like meet with who objects recently who objected recently to the use of pants uhm i don't know what sort of context i've to find that out because that was a very recent sort of message sent down to the newsroom and then on the other hand we have to look at the purpose of a newspaper uhm the function because the newspaper is a medium of communication between the the newsmaker whoever he is government politician or or or a big businessman and the reader and it's a it's i see it because i come from education as an exercise of nation-building you try to communicate with your readers you try to build up consensus or or you try to not to build up consensus you want to you want to encourage discussion or not necessarily dissent but discussion at least and you want to make a the your reader aware of your environment so we look at the news the straits times there's it's like singapore in uhm in forty pages you know you've the hard news the page one news where all the important news from around the world and locally you know is reflected in the straits times you've got the back page where all the big news about what's happening in the money world is reflected in the back page and then you've a section which is rather softer and with a bit of uh they've book reviews there are features that are of human interest then you've the political analysis page you've got the editorial page you've got the forum page where readers write in to tell you what they think they like what they don't like etcetera then you've got a community page which is in the section called life uh which deals with uh particularly singaporean problems it used to be a bilingual section but it's now called community so we deal with social problems we deal with all kinds of problems and then there's a what do you call the news uhm home news which is all the accidents uh list of divorces but that's out now but accidents robbery burglary uhm foul-ups on the highway all that gets in as well as all the campaigns and etcetera whatever so that's a newspaper so it's singapore in forty pages now uhm so obviously it's not possible to say we want to reflect what we think is standard british because i think that's a crazy notion so what do i do i've spent ten years there and i've spent the better part of five years trying to reconcile in my own mind what my job is and i decided that the most important thing is to say we want a bit of this and a bit of that but we've got to be guided by certain basic principles and the basic principle i have thought out is uh the context the context is a guiding concept which is if you see it as a triangle uhm it's going to be the message or the story the content what is the purpose of this story that you're telling if it's an editorial you want to persuade somebody to believe something then your message is i want to persuade singaporeans to believe that a is b or a is not b if it's a news report then i want to just tell this bit of news there was an accident at whatever place at whatever time and so many people were hurt uhm if it is entertainment i want to entertain so that's your story or message at the top of this triangle now of course at one end you're going to have the reader or writer sorry reader or hearer and in the newspaper context it's always reader because we've written we're a written communication so it's a reader what kind of reader he is he is has he got 'o' levels is he uhm is he part of the elite whoever these people are the in is he an intellectual is he a businessman housewife retiree young school student 'a' level whatever what is he looking for when he turns to your story then the other end you've got the writer the writer has got her innate capacity facility with language love of the word or somebody who knows the facts but doesn't know the language very well and she has to have a style of her own and these these i wish i have a there is a wall id uhm if i'm taking too long just stop me you know because we're used to newspaper to chopping and chopping everything you know whenever time is up so i'm used to that another five minutes so in this is the writer so depending on on what these variables are the language gets selected it's always come some sound selection as they write they begin to know what what words to to to to what words to use what words are can be allowed and what cannot be allowed for example some of the words that rosemary uh gave us that beautiful long list i didn't know i've been a friend of hers for twenty years i didn't know that she was compiling this marvellous thing uhm what was it like what did she have like the word shiok for example you know the word those of you who are singaporeans oh i'm sorry ya can you can you hear me now yes i was going on about the word shiok you know i think all singaporeans here know exactly what it means i don't know whether jonathan knows do you know oh it haven't well can somebody explain to him it's it's like delicious marvellous great the word shiok yeh  laughs  not shok but you know but but is that how it's pronounced shirley you must help me out on this  laughs  oh okay look at another word uhm okay look at the word amok you know the word amuck is spelt amuck is that how you spell or amok amok right now very we're very fond of this word cos' i think it's a beautiful word if a man runs wild with a parang or with a revolver whatever and shoots twenty people and he's absolutely crazy uhm you can't call him a wild man you can't call him a mad man all these do not convey that's that situation you know and i think the word amuck does now uhm how would the writer know whether that's useable or not i think they would immediately reach for word for that word because it's so colourful and it communicates to the singaporean exactly uh what he wants to convey but uhm they have some problems with that word which i think su susan will later on come to talk about yap now uhm maybe think of another word uhm let me give you an easier example you know the word kids k-i-d-s i know it's frowned on by some people for example uh the eminent sir what his name now quirk ronald quirk uhm randolph sir randolph quirk yap uhm we used to have a page called kids and things and i used i used to have to deal with uh problems like this we had people uhm sub-editors from the times of london and so who were working in the newsroom when i appeared on the scene they say look let's get together and ban this word kids i said i'm not here in the process of banning anything or legislating or laying down the law uhm we have to get together to learn to use the english language in a way that is acceptable to ourselves and to others and the objection was kids means baby goats now you know that's a very old fashioned and very restricted meaning of the word kids i don't know whether you will agree now uhm so we had this problem of the the word little a little corner of a page for children it's called kids and things you know those little crossword puzzles they can do things they can make and so on now what do you do with that do you say the word kids is non-standard and therefore you know you want the paper to write good english or to reflect good english so out with the word kids what do you put in its place children and things you destroy the whole corner that that page but if we had the headline like uhm ministry of education to test two thousand school children that's a headline for a very formal story which is based on a on a press release sent out by the minister of education do you then say ministry of education to test two thousand school kids no because you know uh you spoil the style of it the tone the the the the style is supposed the best the better word the best word of that headline in that story so it's your one minute here that's just enough for me to fix this  laughs  so you you go back to this concept and you use this to select your language if your story is very formal it should be formal the purpose of your story word singpaoreanisms so how can you not have words like shiok and alamak and so on in it because it's part of the story if your reader your reader is a young singaporean you better have a voice that he can relate to if your writer is not capable of doing humour then don't try to do a piece of on singaporeanisms that's basically uh to answer your question just two now so uh although my gut feeling is to say that we don't want a dictionary of singapore english because i don't think my editors will approve although they gave me permission to be here not knowing what i'm going to do here i think we the thing that they can live i can live with in the context of my work there is to say that in a way the newspaper is trying not to prescribe but to to test the limits of what's possible in terms of uh variations from standard which people have in their minds and therefore a dictionary of singapore english is the other side of the coin  we both help to compile that because fr' not forgetting we are singapore in forty pages we we try we help to compile that and so most of the examples came from the straits times and at the same time when that tome is compiled we are the people who can in some ways best demonstrate the use of uhm these words in the dictionary because we are not restricted to like for example simon is talking about creative writing literature and someone else talking about uhm something else but we have everything in the newspaper we are sort of to some extent specialist and in many ways generalist we have everything in the newspaper in forty pages so i don't know whether that answers the question thank you 
Singapore	now good afternoon to all of you president of the arts club and arts club committee members colleagues the deanery and freshmen and friends well i should very fresh people because we mustn't be too gender you know specific well you have come really to the largest faculty of course the the president of the arts club has said that that the faculty is second to none but we can claim to be certainly the largest faculty on this campus with something like four thousand four hundred students uh three hundred and forty academic staff another ninety to hundred uh non-academic staff so we really are a very large faculty certainly the largest in terms of students and student welfare student education training is our business so we are again welcoming you to this uh faculty of the university i know that uh you've been exposed to a number of welcomes already but never mind this is the month of of when you're just uh coming in and you're most welcome now i'll like to just also say that the deanery reflects the faculty as a whole even among my colleagues i'm from the history department the vice-deans are from geography and political science the sub-deans from economics and statistics and from social work and psychology so we represent already five departments and several subjects because you can see that some of the departments are double-barrel departments with a couple of subjects now we have act actually eleven departments now we have twelve but mass com became a programme the department of mass com was transferred to the second university but we continue with the mass communication programme in this faculty so we've got eleven departments and we've got four faculty programmes together with a new programme being offered by the department of english language and literature namely theatre studies so things are happening we have not just a large faculty but a faculty which comes with a lot of intellectual activity a lot of interesting activity now we're an arts faculty so remember this we want to cultivate not simply uh personality but really the artistic sides of your personality and this is something we want to develop not just giving information but to encourage the imagination this is what art is about but more than that we are also a faculty of arts and social sciences so there's that element of really seeking to be a bit more scientific about things although it's social science there's that element in it trying to uh be more precise to use more quantitative methods and not just using imagination so we want to anchor it in more specific uh inquiries uh this is not to say that the humanities are you know rather free-floating and the science the social sciences are rather hard no there's a blend of it but in your first year you're doing three subjects so you have a chance to uh combine arts and social sciences if you wish and not only also uh this kind of combination but remember combine combining certain subjects with programmes which are multi-disciplinary i'm talking about european studies south-east asian studies linguistics which are supposed to be multi- and even inter-disciplinary and in the case of the studies programmes and the studies departments remember that also that element of language which you are able to pick up so we are really very proud and very happy that we have an opportunity opportunity to offer you such a variety of riches uh in terms of intellectual activity and stimuli now of course you'll be very uh still finding your feet i mean subjects actually but be assured that most students are able to get some of their top choices most of them most of you so be encouraged however if you do have difficulties do try to be a bit uh adventurous a bit more adaptable and be prepared to make a few little changes uh in your thinking so that you can uh maybe pick up something which is new and from our little research we found that don't worry those who even were given you know subjects which didn't really feature in their first three choices managed to do well enough and very few of those who have to do supplementaries and fail really were those who you know just couldn't cope with the subjects they're given so there's no real correlation uh between those who had their first choices and doing extremely well in them or those who did not get their choices and doing badly in them so be encouraged but if you have problems we have uh the department uh to give advice as well as members of the deanery especially the vice-dean dr lee boon hiok and also our our our faculty associate mrs ann wee they're here to really advise you to help you i always say that the vice-dean is not a terrible person unlike the dedication word / designation word  / delegation word 'vice-dean' you know who's out to to look out for vices and or something like that no nothing like that the vice-dean is and and the vice-deans in fact are both ad-vice-deans they give good advice uh on certain matters and both of them are very intimately involved in helping student matters in in student matters not not just one professor lee boon hiok give uh more you know advice about course enrolments and combinations and so on but uh dr victor savage is our liaison with the arts club and societies and he tells me to give a little bit of encouragement to you all of course you are practially ipso facto members of the arts club but be encouraged also to join uh some societies uh the ones which you feel can be of most help uh to you but also be a bit adventurous join other societies even if you're not reading a particular subject so you get a wider exposure to the range with we offer in our faculty well these are just some words of encouragement at this stage because you will hear a lot of things being said a lot of information that you might even get uh intellectual con constipation of some sort terrible you know just can't digest all these things but try to take stock try to pause at times reflect and don't let uh it become systems-overload and all the alarm bells start ringing don't worry just try to uh pause at times take stock of what uh is being offered don't just consult seniors but also attend lectures for yourselves to see what the courses are about before you try to make your choices such choices as you have but nonetheless be encouraged at this time don't be you know despondent because there're always people who are around who can help you well on that note i again warmly welcome you to the faculty on behalf of my colleagues and i wish you every success in your time with us thank you  good evening faculty colleagues friends from the administration and the library and other university officers and students especially the first year's prize winners and ladies and gentlemen now before i give you a short uh address i'd like to introduce colleagues in the deanery and the heads of department to you so as i call i hope they will stand so you can see them and then we'll uh you can greet them in your usual especially if you're from their department well first suh my colleagues in the deanery the two vice-deans associate professor lee boon hiok and dr victor savage the sub-deans dr euston quah and dr low peng hong mrs ann wee faculty associate mrs mary-ann leo administrative officer and ms sheila menon administrative assistant now you'll have to keep on swerving your head left and right because i'll be introducing colleagues on both sides so first uh i like to introduce heads of department professor tham siong chee malay studies professor ong jin hui head of sociology and also director of faculty centre of advanced studies associate professor teo siew eng head of geography associate professor edwin lee head of history associate professor word word  head of economics and statistics associate associate professor tan lee chor acting head of chinese studies and then on this side i like to at the centre there is associate professor or rather professor eddie kuo director of mass communication programme associate professor john quah head of political science professor quah is also the co-ordinator of the european studies programme associate professor chia chia chee meow head of japanese studies dr vasoo head of social work and psychology dr ban kah choon acting head of english language and literature a lot of word supporters up there then dr chong kim chong acting head of philosophy associate professor mohanan coordinator of linguistics programme and last but certainly not least uh we've also got uh the head of the english language proficiency unit here professor lee kok cheong we also have quite a number of special guests in the audience but i i'm afraid i can't introduce all of them there's so many of them but certainly they're very important people in the administration whom you should also meet during the tea we're very happy that they are represented here now i'll like to just say a short word of this tea and why we've organized it well this is intended of course mainly for newcomers although sometimes we have gatecrashers from the other years because they've they've come to know what the tea is about it's a welcome tea especially for freshers but we also welcome old friends and we also have invited first year lecturers and visiting professors to join us so you see some people who are word here only for one year as well as those who teach the first years uh meeting us in this tea this is a good meeting point because in singaporean style it's a eating point where there're eats there're also meets now we also want to use this opportunity to honour to recognise to honour our prize winners our students who have well in their studies as well as society and club people who have helped in student life so this is an opportunity to just say thank you a very big thank you to them now in this connection i want to associate myself with the arts club president in congratulating the club and those who were particularly involved in the making of the faculty float which as lincoln reminded you won a silver medal in the competition yes yesterday so thanks again arts club and all the helpers who made the float i'll like also uh on this very first occasion when i address all of you together to mention that we have introduced two new programmes this year one is an undergraduate programme and that is the art the theatre studies programme which is offered by the department of english language and literature for the first time and we want to congratulate the department for doing so and to welcome all those of you who are registered for theatre studies and then the second programme is a postgraduate programme and that is the masters in public policy which is managed by the centre of advanced studies and under its director professor ong jin hui this is a again a first for our faculty and we've very much uh looked forward to welcoming people from not only singapore but people from the asean countries they've come to join us and even beyond from mexico so we're very happy for the faculty that we have this programme running for the first time this this session i'd like also to make little comments about mass communication again i think that many of you if not most are aware that while mass communication has been transformed from a department to a programme  this is because it was felt that uh for the sake of not dividing resources between the two universities it should should be more or less centralized in the nanyang technological tech technological university nonetheless we have uh obligation to our students in mass communication so last year and again for this year we've taken in a first year intake for mass communication so it's not not not it's no longer a department it is a very vibrant programme of the faculty and uh director of the programme professor eddie kuo is simultaneously dean of the school of communication studies ntu which will receive it's first intake next year so this is just to explain the little change but nonetheless we are very much assured the students are assured that things will go on as usual you will graduate with nus degrees so we're very happy that this will not really affect resources being/been given to the mass communication students and staff so i thought this would be important to explain now a word to the freshies a special word now we want want to congratulate those who have made it because for everyone who has been accepted into the two universities four or five have been turned away so those of you who have come in you're very fortunate and we want to warmly welcome and congratulate you on coming into nus and to our faculty we also would like to say that it's a bit be bewildering to be a member a student in the faculty of arts and social sciences because there are eleven departments and four faculty programmes one department programme and so on and so many other subjects which have been offered including an import of mathematics from the science faculty but i'll like to assure you that we have a embarrassment of riches not of poverty to contend with now you may not always have the subjects of your choice but we'll try and give you uh perhaps your first choice at least of two or three of your choices as far as possible but at this stage i want to counsel a little bit of flexibility on your part please don't be too disappointed if you don't get all the three subjects of your choice but we'll try our best to accomodate uh you in at least uh your your top two choices so this is just a word to all of you because in trying to be fair to some we might be unfair to so many others so i trust you'll understand our constraints and on your part exercise a little bit of uh flexibility and adaptability as you come in for the first year but nonetheless may i in advance wish you every success in your studies and your eca uh on this campus now in conclusion i'll like to thank especially the faculty's social committee and the arts club people who've helped in organizing this welcome tea and now what else remains we're going to eat soon but there remains also to give out the prizes and i want to in in advance congratulate all of the prize winners and those who have contributed to the faculty and then after that of course we can all have tea together thank you  
Singapore	friends it's very difficult to come in at the tail end of this distinguished company not least because like uh john silkin uhm i also found the the type of forum rather rather daunting dauntingly bored but uhm i'll do my best like mr silkin and ramble on for five or ten minutes and then perhaps we can go along with some questions if you have questions for any of us uhm i haven't brought with me my books otherwise we'll read something from that that will take up five minutes but uhm what i'll do instead is is just present one or two thoughts on this type of creativity and genre uhm most have difficulty with that word actually pronouncing it the second word whether or not i'm pronouncing it correctly now uhm the the first thing i think that confronts an asian writer anyway uhm is something more fundamental than than genre and something which mr lee has mentioned uh which is really the issue of language what language does one write in to start with uhm for me i never had any choice because my own writing  word uhm and i think for many singaporeans many young singaporean writers that's really the case now because of the young singaporeans are writing in english uhm i personally don't feel that is something we should be embarrassed or ashamed about and and uh i i certainly sympathise with mr lee and uh with you know uhm it's an awkward position that he's taken but nonetheless writing in the language other than uhm one's uh one's ancestral tongue from my father's side my ancestral tongue is tamil uh and i regret to say i i wasn't able to understand mr ramisamy's poems my own inadequacies uhm but i think that one of the things which one has to consider is that writing in in english language there is the question of of genre in which you of of of of the traditions from which you want to borrow uhm i think it's exciting to to to to hear uh what mr ha professor hasmiah's his poems which attempt to use the persian or urdu form of bizarre and transpose that to the english language uhm i think that's something which which singaporean writers had to be concerned about uhm the because when one writes in english as a singaporean in a way one can face a situation where one's writing is very thin because we don't we seem to have lost our history by writing in this other language uhm and we have to i think consciously strive perhaps more consciously than people who are writing in within a a fixed tradition we have to strive more consciously to pull hang on to some of those those those tradition to build up our own resource and i think one of the great things done in singapore is that uh we're not although we may be cut off in one sense from an ancestral tradition the fact is that when we cut off from many ancestral traditions so we can borrow from all of those ancestral traditions and so in a way hopefully perhaps through these pieces of project of mine or and of others both a language built on literature which is strong because it can draw from all these many sources and not be ashamed about doing so and perhaps i i i could just mention one or two ways in which i've been trying to do this uhm first of all my my first book first loves doesn't fall within any genre that i know of i i have been confronted from time to time by academics uh asking me you know well what are you trying do and where does this structure from uhm frankly i i i don't know uhm it's uh the the book really consist in short stories about a group of friends growing up but uhm the the the stories are structured in a particular way uhm and nestled within this within a structure are stories written from other people's viewpoints uhm really i never thought about the structure before starting to write or to go through naturally other with a curiosity to find out more about the characters and so worked through it write other stories uhm and i think in a way genre of course is is something which critics abet to give themselves here something to do to comment say ah these are the conventions of this genre these are the conventions of that genre uhm but of course it's still useful as as hashmir said because you have these conventions to take off the gates traditions are things you you build on and you react against uhm but i will skip one or two one or two examples first of all perhaps a a rather uhm a rather uhm uhm deciduous example uhm in in in singa well in malaysia and singaporean history there's an important book for this sejarah melayu which is basically a a chronicle of uhm of the history of malacca and also to some extent the history of singapore as it it is its first incarnation as a as a city state as a trading port in the thirteenth century uhm and i think that's an important resource for us even if we're working not in malay but in english uhm stella kon has used uhm passages examples from sejarah melayu i've also done so uhm when i say it's deciduous example because i i've used in one of my stories uh the episode of the sword fish attack on singapore which many of you are probably uh familiar with it about how the the the the genius of a little boy saved singapore from this this terrible terrifying sword fish attack sword fish were coming and flying onto the beach and killing everybody and so it's a pretty serious situation but this little boy had the idea of of cutting down banana stems and building a barricade and of course you can imagine what happened to the sword fish uh course that word  stop him the sword stuck in the bamboo in the banana stems and that was it they were they were easily killed at least that's what how the story goes but uhm that's not the really important point of the story the important point of the story is that uh the the uh the ruler of that time far from uhm uhm congratulating uhm the little boy recognise it ah yes here is a threat to uh to my power and uh had the boy executed uhm and that of course was was the the point of the story but i'm i use it in in in a story of mine using it totally deciduously but uhm still trying to work through some of these ideas and bring them into my own writing uhm where i had a couple of young boys competing for the attention of a of a young girl uhm in the way that goes on all the time and the the secret weapon which one of them wheels in or unleashes and successfully wins the girl the girl's attention at any rate though there are complications later on uhm he's to produce this story and captivate them with his story uhm uh whereas the other the other boy doesn't have this historical depth to win that particular fight uhm more seriously perhaps uhm i've uhm tried to to use from not only literary resources but also some of the historical things around singapore uhm uhm for example one of my short stories tries to tries to work on the uhm a a a monument in cambodia called the bayon who tries to make certain uh good word imagination to make certain comparisons suggest certain warnings uhm generally just to play around with this this image of the bayon this monumental achievement uhm of a kingdom which shortly thereafter disintegrated uhm and compare that with with raffles place our own monumental achievement uhm and i i've also tried to work with uhm with some chinese literary traditions uhm particularly with the dream of the red chamber in first loves i i worked off that quite a lot it's one of the episodes in in in that uhm because i think there are there are qualities of of of of sensibility which are things we should not lose which we can rework and bring bring into singaporean literature uhm perhaps i've i've said enough anybody who might like to go word  thank you  uhm today's talk uh entitled writer beyond labels so can you all hear me at the back i think i wanted to approach this from several ways but if i could start for instance very simple something i wrote there's nothing wrong in the world when you were your young and people ask you want to do they mean do you want to be a doctor engineer a lawyer pilot what if you think you want to be kinder or knowledgable writer they think you're crazy you're here i understand because you're young have written and believe want to write some more i'm here because i'm not so young uh i have written and some believe that i am a writer so if i'm a writer and you inspire to be writers then question central question is what can i tell you about becoming a writer that's i think the underlying thing this whole programme it's a very important question to think for i want to start from the first question if not start word  but the talk today focuses on one thing first who and what is a writer that's the first label i wish to mention in speaking to you today uh in a sense entitled writer: beyond labels the first label is writer uhm i think the writer's image is cast in the popular imagination it's a bit of a mixture amalgam of well-known sometimes famous writers sometimes not so famous writers or infant writers uhm and i think we all have our image of what a writer is or should be hence sometimes brooding wearing all black i remember i went to a college once the teacher told that in three years of after speaking to them i was the first one who went up not wearing all black uh the writer should be even tragic of course intelligent witty grand in some ways also struggling because all writers and artist should struggle eccentric strange different sometimes i know we all have our little images of the writers may think of where we think what people understand some of us may be hemmingway word thomas  word black uh jack kerouac some word  and those of you who are really into asian literature well you can name them uh but for those of us who are english rightly or wrongly may have these images of what stumped the revolt of becoming a writer uh and sorry so accurately or inaccurately directly or indirectly these and other writers i haven't mention come to mind when we think of writing writer that's good i think that's good that it helps us decide on the various paths we can take path path you should take and it also comforts us to know that there the others who have travel on that path before us uh for example when i started writing uhm one of the real reasons i'm involved in creative arts programme not so much as much as i am uhm is because of another poet doctor edwin thumboo who is in charge of this programme when i was about your age yes i was once your age uh prof thumboo spent a lot of time helping me in my writing uh airing out correction and gave some suggestions built in helped many writers in singapore  so since of locally as well as the foreigner images i mentioned it's good for us because we know that there are things we aspire to or even surpass and they are people to look towards as models in a sense 
Singapore	i would like to uh welcome all of you uh to this uh fourth biotech workshop for teachers can i just for a show of hand in case somebody here has last year for this workshop if you have come here before you don't have to come again i can give you the certificate take the book and go somewhere don't tell anybody in anyway somebody has just realised that she has come twice no okay so this is your first time here right uhm i'll just fill you in with some background of the workshop that we have uh done so far for the past three years we've been running uh this workshop in 1990 uh we ran and 1991 we ran the workshop for cover the junior college teachers and when we finished uhm the whole lot of junior college teachers we have to go on now to the secondary school teachers and last year second uh some of half or probably a third of secondary school teachers came and this year we are doing the rest uh i'm not sure if we have covered all but uh if we have not then uhm next year we might have to run another one so uhm unless there is a change in policy anywhere whether it's from science centre or from ministry of education then we will uh adjust the curriculum of this workshop accordingly right so uh this could well be the last in the series so i hope you'll uh find this uh uh workshop uh a profitable one our head of department sends uh uh professor kon oi lian sends her apologies for not being able to word word  you address you uh she's taken away for uh an important meeting so she asked me to say uh a few words of welcome on her behalf uh we are very pleased to be involved in this uh project uh in joint collaboration with science centre the singapore society for biochemistry and molecular biology uh then the sponsorship of the economic development board uh to hold this uh kind of workshop as we all know that the uh biotechnology is an important industry in uh there is growth of importance in uh western nations is therefore essential for singapore to have some kind of uh economic some kind of in growth into this very type of industry and to do that we need to raise the general awareness of uh biotechnology among the populous that is why uhm one reason why uh the edb is sponsoring this uhm workshop under its education and public awareness scheme under the umbrella of the national biotechnology programme was uh started in 1990 but uh at this point they are many new word to this in biotechnology and that is why our students of today would become the workforce of tomorrow and uh they should at least have some understanding of biotechnology all we reach students we need to be school and we are educators that is why we have this workshop uhm here today uh because uh we may face some uh the uh rush later on maybe it'll be easier if i were to give you your certificate word  i i i trust you all completely i noticed that uh ex uh there are no uh miss mrs anne dhanaraj is not here yes mrs mary toh is also not here miss yeo is also not here so i think it's okay i can give it to you alright uhm the first few sections are the introduction and word  word uhm followed by uhm the green notes of the the introductory notes of the lecture followed by the laboratory schedule there are four practicals that we will be doing in an hour and uh plus you'll be amazed that how many things you could do in four hours uh four in in in a short span of one hour plus and that would be followed by uh several demonstrations which we'll divide you into several groups and then we'll go in a circus word if you don't want you can uh uh uh you can move along to the next one if you're not interested in whatever station it is okay it's not a case of uh do not pass go or do not collect two hundred dollars straight to jail word word  well if you're not interested in a particular section just move on okay so it's uh very easy going i hope you have uh relaxing afternoon in view of the stress that we face as educators of our administrators all the time uh that is uh off the off the record uhm so uh do refer to these notes that are when we come to that section now okay uh there are some supplementary notes to accompany these demonstrations and uh word  i would like now to introduce uh mrs anne dhanaraj who has been working very hard behind the scenes to make sure that uh this project gets proper funding and uh she's done a lot of work in uh getting our booklet ready for us and uh we in the past few uhm past three years she's been working also very hard making sure that our provide that continuity in the four workshops that we've conducted so far and she's of course aided by many of her able assistants who are here with her today and they are seated at the back we acknowledge their their uhm very enthusiastic support for this biotech workshop in fact i might would like to ask her in fact to say a few words with regard to uh to the uh the new uh exhibits that will be in stored in science centre soon in the pipeline secret at the moment so what's this phase okay so uhm there will be a brief break where you can have some refreshments uh in the middle i am sorry it's a bit modest one uhm in view of the fact that we want to save avoid being too much of a consumer so i shall not uhm move on quickly to uh first part of our today's uh uh word  did you all a word outline of the the the programme they are so word  got a couple of lectures until about three o'clock and these will be very short ones announcement that we have to cater to a wide spectrum of people coming from uh diverse back from diverse background and you we have uhm assume certain target words that uhm you should know uhm and you know and this will give us our later word  stop us uhm stop me in the in the middle of my talk to ask me questions okay otherwise follow me later on and uh squeeze out definitions from me later uhm for use in practicals you can catch hold of me there are some people who came in just came in right did i miss out you certificates now we begin by uh uh discussing some ideas about what biotechnology is uh what better way than to begin in singapore the minister of state has identified biotechnology as one of the twin pillars of singapore's future economy the other being information technology and which is why uh in the nine early part of this decade the national biotechnology plans was formulated in order to spearhead singapore's entry into this new start rise so called start rise industry which has uh caused a great move in the western countries of course a lot of these uh media uh hype about hype about biotechnology was uhm overplayed up uh but we are slowly beginning to see the fruits of uhm biotechnology for instance uh recombinant human insulin is now uh in the market we have recombinant some of us may have received uh jabs of a vaccine jabs of uh uh hepatitis b vaccine previously we have to uh round up all the uh homosexuals to uh extract syrum word from them and uh try to purify these thin word particles and then try to formulate the vaccine out of them and of course that is extremely hazardous both for the for the people who prepare it as well as the recipients of this plasma based vaccine but with biotechnological approaches uh is able we are able now to produce safe vaccines for the general uh use by the population so you can see that some of these material and and later on in the practical you will see some of these biotechnology products that are hitting the consumer market that is why all the more reason we should have some basic awareness of it's all about because of the biotechnology has been word  identified as important way back in the 19 in the middle of the last decade in 1985 i remember as a a young student word to say that but student in the in the in university word in university college i i drop by at uh professor uh louie lim and chris tan  word place down in london and they were so enthusiastic about this particular new venture goh keng swee has uh mr goh keng swee has dr goh keng swee apparently had called up professor chris tan uh assigned him this task of setting up the institute of molecular and cell biology and they were so keen and word in the east end of london professor louie lim was spreading out the plans of this particular institute on his uh beautiful floor and then telling me how nice it was and uh i was hoping that i've got a place there of course i didn't uh this institute has been set up built in 1987 bring in quite a lot of uh outside talent as well as homegrown talent uh to spearhead research basic research into molecular biology and cell biology and you can see this blue building as you approach uh  word the university you can see the building set behind the uh uh greenery of uh kent ridge reserve this building with its cutting edge word at the cutting edge of research even the architecture reflects its uh role in uh spearheading singapore bi bioscience of course this research has been going on kind of research has been basic research has been going on in our de departments for a long time and some of you may identify your former mentors but we have progress a long way since these old equip type of equipments uh to sophisticated equipments such as uh this instruments uh halc type of performance or high pressured liquid chomotography uh uh equipment and not only that we have uh the research as spilled out from the laboratories to the uh to the field and you can see here a map of singapore with marked ingredients marked in green the agrotechnology word  parks uh that has been set up by the primary production department uh some of these sites are already uh ready and uh some uh agrotechnology farms have been set up so if you do have a chance to uh drive around the outskirts of singapore city do feel free to turn off the beating word  track and visit some of them word  have a look at some of these agrotechnology parks uhm some some of these uh are employing new techniques to culture or to grow orchids or hydrofornics word culture of uh all sorts of uhm vegetables and so on so again we are just not confining our our inroads into biotechnology within the laboratory but also uh in more diverse over diversified front i noticed word from yesterday that this was blocking the view yah fine i will lower this slightly now bio word allow me to focus uhm now the word biotechnology actually is a very loose term and uh many disciplines contribute to the this uh multi-disciplinary subject ranging from genetics biochemistry chemistry microbiology even across to uh the hard sciences and engineering  and uh as i describe biotechnology later on you will see why because of this multi-disciplinary approach towards biotechnology it is not surprising that there are many definitions 
Singapore	it's the uhm latest 32 bit operating system from microsoft which will offer you both uh the power and reliability but more importantly it is an open operating system that is uhm scalable with hardware and portable across multiple platform uhm in microsoft we have this internal rating of our product uhm that is we have products that we develop that we think they are real cool and we have products that we think that they are way cool but for windows nt we think they are absolutely awesome okay we are we are really thrilled with the roll out plan of windows nt and particularly with the broad industries report behind windows nt that you will get to see when i present my charts itself okay so in the next uh thirty minutes or so i'll like to be able to just go through an overview of windows nt so that you know uh what windows nt is all about what are the benefits it brings to you and hopefully it'll be it will excite you enough to make sure that you come to my uh windows nt launch which is in a couple of months so stay tune and look out for the uh the press release or or the announcement of the launch first i'll like to just share with you what is microsoft system strategy and what is our key objective one we really want to build the windows uh fam into a family of products you are quite well aware of today that windows 3.1 is in fact the defacto standard it's selling more than a million copies per month so what and and it is primarily being uh uh available uh or being run on on a desktop environment itself so what we what to do is really to extend windows nt's family uh or rather windows family to reach the corporate mission critical computing environment and also reach downwards to non pc devices such as office and consuming uh consumer environment which you will a lot about it in a couple of months so if you will this is really a uh graphical representation of our system strategy okay and uh there are various options by which we could uhm uhm consider in implementing our win fab windows family of products one is that we're going to have taken a one size fit all kind of approach whereby uh we build one implementation of windows and making sure it address all the requirements of the user or the another approach is what uh is is to build a single uh architecture such word such that it provide a very consistent look and feel a very consistent programming model and also a ability to provide assistance uh consistent underlying network uh technology so that the idea is that you can have a single architecture but you can implement new technology in the various uhm uh implement it in various ways such that it will address all the various specific users' needs okay so we have adopted the latter approach and we think it is a uh unique approach in the market place word  given the ability to spend windows nt of products from all the way notebook pen-computing and all the way to a risc work station and symmetric multi-processing environment itself to the windows family of products includes windows 3.1 windows workbook nt windows nt and even the advance server they are all complementary products and are not meant to replace one another itself so if you look at windows and windows workgroup it is primarily uhm a the desktop application arena where it focus on the individual pc user uh enhancing its productivity and being the mainline business application for the user itself whereas windows nt is directly a super set of windows 3.1 or windows for workbook if you will okay it is really targeted at the business and technical computing environment it is designed to the client server uh a client server is designed to the client server operating system providing a high level of uh functionality and robustness in the operating system so that its needs is very targeted on the inset itself okay so what are some of the design goals when we started the windows nt we wanted it to be a small true 32-bit multi-tasking operating system based upon the microkerner uh design okay that it has to be portable across intel and the risc platform and it will have to support multiple subsystem such as dos win 16 win 32 posix os 2 right and it also has to support the very the merging multiprocessing uh environment itself and finally huge capacities because we're talking about business and the technical computing environment since we started our we held our first uh windows nt 32 developers conference in san francisco the momentum for windows nt is just tremendous and i just want to take a few moments to go through a couple of charts to tell you what where are where are the industry support what are industry talking about it okay uhm we have managed to ship about sixty thousands sd case which are software development kit uh within seven months from the day we uh had the uh windows developer conference in san francisco and we have about four hun four thousand corporate customers worldwide evaluating windows nt today and i and that number is going to go up to twenty thousand with a word with a much later and in fact the book inside windows nt and if some of you have attended uh the lucky three hundred customers who attended my windows nt corporate preview in march you might have a copy of this book in fact it has been the number two uh in the computer book uh best selling list in fact it outsell the famous book by madonna itself and uh we have just recently completed a survey uhm we did a random uh sample of the people at that time who have purchased the software development kit to find out who they are and what they are intending to do with it cause that that is important to us as well as for our customer itself and we find that eighty three per cent of the guys who actually bought it are developer so that's good news and ten per cent of these guys are con consultants and seven per cent of them are end user and when we ask what they were going to do with the developer kit twenty-one per cent said they were actually going to develop applications for resell alright twenty-seven said it was for internal use and eighteen per cent for consulting customers uhm obviously it's going to be a a formable forth in an environment and consultants have to know how to consul how to implement for their customers in consultancy area and four per cent of that data be for personal use but more but more interesting is this chart and i do apologise for it being very wordy and actually not very clear it's not very sharp uhm about three thousand developer says that they going have us develop more than nine thousand retail windows application nt applications within the next twelve months excuse me and that's a lot of application uh on windows nt to be available as it roll out uh in in the next couple of months and fifty-seven per cent of these developers said they in fact are developing windows nt application for mission critical line and business applications this is exactly what we have targeted it for and it's and we are develop developing mission critical line and bi business application for windows nt and sixty-nine per cent of the new windows nt application in fact is designed in a client server environment and twenty-five per cent of developers are actually beginning to port unix mbs and even bms application uh onto windows nt itself there are a lot of developer too tools available today seventy plus of them and you see a lot more being available as the product being rolled out but what is really interesting to find is that leading mainframe tool vendors like computer associate word knowledge ware these guys are porting their tools on windows nt and think about if you are a corporate uh or mis developer you're so used to using these tools and we have the same tools running on windows nt and that would really facilitate your effort in uh trying to develop client server application itself so who would want windows nt definitely the windows power users by that we mean these are the people uhm who who will buy the the fastest and the greatest in technology they will usually be the first adopter and they very often  word play a role as a window as a leader in the windows community itself so we certainly think that the windows power user will will be out there to grab for windows nt mis and business solution builders definitely uh where their role is past the developing application for their organisation or for their customers windows nt will definitely provide a very uh robust environment for which they can deploy solution for customers or for themselves their own organisation advance business application users these are the guys that is probably running a claims processing application in insurance industry or it could be a banking application or an order processing application and these guys can actually run all these word  application of windows nt given that it's a very secure environment developers definitely our target uhm you've seen with the anti-clave a lot of developers are in fact developing applications for windows nt and finally the engineering and uh technical users so wherever they are a cad/cam designer for a automative or a airline uhm industry they certainly will be able to use windows nt because there are a lot of the uh leading cad/cam software vendors today are porting their application to windows nt and one of these examples is intergraph in fact they they gonna port quite a complete suite of their products to windows nt itself so what is windows nt it has a core set of features okay and uhm one of the first and foremost one of the most important asset that you will able to uhm uh uh to to advantage is that the fact that windows nt is windows okay so whether you're running a windows application or looks like windows and so forth it is windows it is that user interface that you you've grown to use uh all this while and grown to love okay in addition it will also have provides you with scaleable power security reliability easy management compatibility with a lot of the variety of systems that is available today and most importantly an open platform for a lot of third party innovations itself and we'll go into some of these in details uhm uhm in this couple of charts windows nt is windows so it won't within some uh common function as in windows and that's typically that it is going to be easy to use you act you can see windows nt being demonstrated behind the room it is exactly like the windows interface data workend so there is very little uhm uhm time needed in uh learning to use the system all you need to want to be concern with is how do i use my application cause that's what you want the system do for you not learn a new operating system that has that require you to learn to to go through a new and to rethink so this a very logical migration for someone who has been used to windows environment sit on the windows nt and start being productive of their system today we certainly have a a a a very uh rich set of applications today that's already on windows 3.1 and this set of applications will run on windows nt  the last three points are really uh fundamental addition to the windows platform of products which will begin to see as a consistent functionality that were prevalent in the whole suite of windows family of products that is uh basically the botian networking so as you buy windows nt you could actually be able to do a peer to peer networking with your colleagues sharing files uh and printers and also email each other okay 
Singapore	and in fact when i started teaching since 84 i realise one thing that a lot of men and women has great substance great potential right before a lot of them didn't realise that they could do far greater things than what they have been doing and there's another group of people that they try hard to but they can't reach it there because they seems to be beating around the bushes and there's another group of people that who wake up in the morning and blame god for what they are and those that are people who never get going and also there's also another group of people that have great substance but never feel convince anybody that they have they never give themselves a chance for us to discover them because of their exterior that they put across so we're going to show you today that how human being read you and between you and god you know what god expect out of you but you have to also understand that you're already in this earth when you deal with people and you must know what people want from you before you can talk about your god before you can talk about anything that you want to say alright so beauty is so important that it is no more really you do what you like because you're not really in a world of your own by yourself you have to do what you like best and what others like you to do as well because if you do what you like and others can't stand it you're going to pay a price for being wrong a tremendous heavy prices that you can never calculate opportunities in life lost a great opportunities that can never be calculated alright so you have to come to understanding about what others want and by the time you're able to make others feel comfortable to be with you even then your likings will change because others like you in a certain thing majority of our what we like what we prefer is influence by what others like us to project isn't it true why you like a certain outfit why do you like a certain look because your friend like you to be like that isn't it true you like a certain dress because everytime you wear it people say that you look great you wear a certain tie everytime you wear it people say your tie looks nice remember your tie look nice not you okay there's a lot difference between hey you look great today rather than your dress is beautiful alright and and i started learning from human being every talk and every class and every people i have meet i learn one thing that there's a lot of difference between people who are poorer and a lower living standard and people go higher and as you go higher doesn't mean that you're happier as you go rich it doesn't mean that you're happier and a happiest person i've ever seen are people who are able to bring themselves down to the same group of people they're mixing with the happiest people are people who are able to be accepted by human beings isn't it true so how do you come to a compromise and how do you project it through with all first and foremost through your exterior image you get exposure you improve and you upgrade i'm not saying by if uh dressing nicely you'll be rich do you understand i'm just saying that if you can be for for a club and you can be the best for the club if you achieve you promoted to be secretary and you know i'm secretary be a best looking secretary or it give you incentive to perform better your boss can see that you're well-guarded it give you more incentive to upgrade that's how people move on in life alright now the dressing plays a very important role the colour the style the texture the prints and fabric any one part of it wrong enough to make you look awful and before i can teach you how to dress in word  all of us here have to one thing when we go back home just take a mirror and take a good look at ourself and tell ourself that we're good-looking okay i tell you why i tell you why you have to do that because too many of us want to be like someone else the small eyes wants to make bigger the flat nose want to have it higher the square face want to have it rounder and the round face want to have it longer i always tell people that small eyes can be nice don't you agree right so if you if you don't learn to like yourself it is very difficult for others to learn to like you isn't it true if you can't even stand your face how can people like your face right irregardless of your shortness your height the darkness the fairness even to the extent of being bald you can be great in your own way and first by using colours of your coordination and after that we make you look rarefied using different styles and fabrics that you use you just have to remember that it's doesn't even cost a lot if you know how and cost a lot if you don't know how and bring out the best of you i am going to take you to the first part of the talk on how the colours can match you and then the style then we go for a break and after that after the break we're going to teach you how to carry yourself through you having outfit but don't know how to sit and walk and and move properly people can't respect your outfit as well alright now with colours probably that you can wear many women alike dressing it's not just for women you have to understand that it's a lot more important for men as well because men don't use makeup so when they are wrong they are completely wrong and and women can get away and run away with some parts of it wrong and some parts of it right that's why it's so important for men now the colours that you can wear you have to remember that got nothing with how young or how old you are so what i tell you today you will not feel strong much alright it's not true when your mother says that i am fifty-five now and seventy now i shouldn't be wearing red anymore i don't see why when you are older you should try and make yourself look older in fact the older you are the younger you should try and look right the younger you are you can afford to look older does it make sense if you're eighteen year old you don't mind looking thirty because even if you look thirty cause even if you look thirty you're not that old but the time you're sixty you should try and look like forty okay i tell you when i didn't realise it's so important age is so important until i started teaching and there's this a very matured chinese american chinese who come to me and she walked into my studio and she said i want to see jill and she sat next to me and she said are you jill she was very word screening me all the way down i said yes i am jill why'd you expect me to be forty years old we talk over the phone she thought i was forty years old and i said i'm going to teach you how to be forty looking like me and after that she has completely different face she realised that you can be forty looking like me you understand the different it doesn't mean you are forty you must look like forty alright now it's got nothing to do with your age colours that you can wear whether it's your hair colour your spectacles right down to your socks and shoes that you wear has got nothing to do also with how fair or how dark you are otherwise all the indians must wear same colour okay i tell you one big problem here we took four years to get the right to do it here because the american claim that we chinese are all the same we're all fair skinned dark hair dark eyes you just turn around and look at all your friends many of you've got dark hair but many of you do not have black hair do you understand a lot of people tell you have but you don't have black hair that's the big difference okay so we are not interested in how fair or how dark you are and also we are not interested in how fat or how thin you are at this moment colour cannot make a person look slim have you ever heard of people saying that you are fat you wear black you look slim how many of you have raise your hand when you are fat you make yourself black say you look slimmer now remember that black is one of the one of the strongest attention drawing colours of all colours so if you are fat and you wear black the first thing people see is the black and there there you're fat can you hear as i've mentioned that there's nothing wrong being fat and there's nothing wrong being thin and there's nothing wrong being old it takes you to like your fat it takes you like yourself and old people can see you that see that you grow and respectable and gracefully okay now what'll be a good example from word is can you imagine two women who got fat legs going to a party going to a function and one is very conscious about it so she wear black to make her look slim the other think that you know it's not a problem because my my legs are not that gorgeous i might as well just wear pink colour so nobody can see now these two women go to the party one in black stocking one in pink colour stocking now who do you think will look obviously in this fabric the one in black isn't it so what more it is on the whole length on the body everybody will notice that you're fat are you clear now so remember all the more you're fat you should stay away from black to make a person look slim or fat is is found on the clothing the fabric that you can use the print of the fabric alright the length and the detail the cut of the clothing not the colour okay the colours that you can wear relates to your skin colour or the print word word you call it warm-cool warm or cold now how do you see it's warm and cool a person who is warm looks golden they get freckles easily so people who are warm looks bronzy they just stay dark and brown all the time they are the ones who can carry umbrella wherever they go they will still look so warm they are the ones who can use seven-day scrub imagine if they scrub everyday scrub no use right they just look bronzy when they get dark they look very dark like bill crosby you know bill crosby they're very dark brown to black word you call them now the cool ones are porcelain-pale white ones porcelain-pale white ones those are the people where you see them they're porcelain white by the time they get suntan or baking themselves for two three days in the sun they will only turn red like a lobster but they never look brown okay  they are the ones that eventually when they do get dark they will just look plain burn 
Singapore	thank you well this morning i think uh we can all be more relaxed because uh don't have any vips around here with us so uh feel easy and during the i'll try and uh restrain myself so that you can have some question time and during question time please feel free to ask questions go to the mic and ask them now uh some of you may have heard of me uh some may not my name is uh goh sin tub and uh because i have a tendency to write ghost stories uh the ghost lover of emerald hill ghost lover second edition and uh ghost of singapore and more ghost of singapore so my friends uh pull my leg and say that my initials stand for ghost story teller of course gst stands for something more horrible now uh actually how i came about writing ghost stories was that while i started off in an unguarded moment writing the story the ghost lover of emerald hill uhm that's about that's uhm uh about a haunted house that i remember from my childhood days uh it's a house in emerald hill and uh reporters from the press have been trying to get me to identify which house but being a developer or involved with development companies uh i do not want to disclose because it might uh lower the value of the house but in any case the house is no longer haunted uh it was haunted uh during the time when i was a kid and uh the ghost did scare away quite a number of families but ultimately the ghost lover came along and he solve the problem uh i shall be reading you some extracts later on on these stories which i have written but after i wrote the ghost lover of emerald hill my friends thought that uh i had become a kind of an expert in ghost stories so they kept on telling me their ghost stories their own ghost stories asking me to become their ghost writer as it were hence i discovered that i uh was quite popular with ghost of singapore and in fact the ghost of singapore sold so well that my publisher insisted i should come out with more ghost of singapore and this has been selling well too but uh it's rather a bad reputation so i'm trying to make a break away from ghost and uh i in the mean time have written another uh book called the nan mei-su girls of emerald hill these are some girls i knew uh when i was in emerald hill i stayed in emerald hill for the best part of my young youth uh when i was a child and when i was a young man and uh uh the nan mei-su girls were actually waitresses working in a in a japanese restaurant and many people confuse them with the prostitutes the uh uh who were use by the uh japanese army and uh of course when the uh story came out uh i had to keep on denying that they were prostitutes i was defending their honour when i was a kid because the neighbours always thought that they were bad girls but i i they were my friends and i knew they were not bad girls they were people who were earning a living and i find that fifty years later i am still defending their honour uh anyway uh what i propose to do this morning is just to uh illustrate the points which i am making with some extracts from the stories and perhaps even some some of the poems which i have written now before i go on i mustn't forget the title the title is to right or not to right - that is the question that is not the question in fact to write or not to write that is the question uh depends on how you spell write uh to right or not to right that is not a question in my mind because uh i don't think a writer should really be involved in an activist manner with issues if he wants to be actively involve he goes out and becomes a politician or a lawyer fighting a case or you know anybody that is trying to right a wrong so the writer should be more concern with whether he's to write and that's spelt with a double u to write or not to write that is the question to write or not to write uh if he has it in him and uh he can express it then he should write if he has it in him and cannot express it he should not write if he hasn't got it in him but can express whatever he hasn't got he still shouldn't write so to write or not to write that is the question double u to write or not to write that is the question and uh i think that uh writers have to be sure about these two aspects what he has in him what he can say ideas expression ideas expression these are the two two two main things uh you must have the ideas and you must know how to express them and these two make a writer the theme of this whole uhm conference is bridging worlds and i think uh my topic is particularly relevant in this respect because the writer's main role is really to bridge worlds he has something he wants to say and he has to bridge this world across to that world to the other world he has to be able to convey what is important to him what he thinks is worth expressing worth talking about worth letting other people people know and he ha to bridge worlds the main world being himself and the old rest of mankind so first task is bridge worlds and what what has he to offer he has what his perception of life the truths as he sees them the truths may come about in different ways it may be a young person under oppression because of the lack of understanding of the older folks somehow or other he he or she would want to put this across so that hopefully we pick up somewhere it'll help other some other people it could be uh the gap between not between generations but the gap between sexes it could be the gap between races the gap between religions there are many worlds that require bridging and i think a writer's decision whether to write or not to write should be based on whether he has got something to say and that he has he has the way to express it with regard to matters which would help to bridge worlds now this is talking in in very uh you know high faluting terms and so on well when it come down to uh more basic things you are really talking about uh maybe minor things or things which appear to be minor but can be very important uh so these things will come out in in in in in uh the various works uh that you write at one time when i started write write writing i found that uh uh one of my difficulties was really the lack of experience the lack of life experience uh but you make up for that in a way because you make up for that because you talk to people and if you develop that perception you'll begin to understand you get a second-hand experience you read you get a second-hand experience but for some people that second-hand hand experience is even more in depth and more meaningful than first-hand experience for for for other people you'll you will come across many people like that who would go through life you know experiencing something day after day but at the end of the of uh you know several years and decades and so on would really miss the point totally so it is intensity and the perception which you bring to bear on experience whether first-hand second-hand or third-hand that is important so don't be fazed in anyway don't be worried in anyway by lack of experience because you can make up for it in many ways expression that is a more difficult area that's an area where you have to sweat over you have to learn a lot you have to learn like reading you have to learn uh from the advice that you get from others and from your own trial and error and then you pick up you will find quite soon enough that if you start off if you have if you start off with humour you win a lot of people uh then if you want to be solemn and you want to talk about something which matters a lot something which is very sensitive uh has an emotional content then you're going to find it very difficult to it like this from me across to you in a big lecture hall like that you'll find it easier one on one uh you'll find it easier if it is when the group is smaller but still a writer has to do it not one on one but one on many because his book will be read by so many different people he's not going to scold everybody here many people that have been going to uh to uh not like what he has written that doesn't really matter he should accept that but if you are getting your message across you're bridging worlds that's what counts and sometimes uh you may only reach a minority but that minor minority may be the important minority so it doesn't matter you still have to write now let me uh give you some illustrations of things which i of things which i have written uh first of all to make my point of about uh humour this is a a story from the book the ghost lover of emerald hill and other stories and the title of the story is the curse of hylinmong it's about my grandfather and it's partly true but there is a lot of bullshit about it as well well there i was telling a story of introducing my grandfather but uh you see if you if you introduce humour take it along lightly uh you have a better chance or uh keeping the reader with you uh i have some friends who tell me that they like this part of the story but unfortunately they don't buy the book they just read it in the bookshops and put it back in the selves that's one of the hazards that uh writers will have to go through well there's that is an example of a light approach now let me uh read you a story which is a little bit more serious yes when i was uh round your age or so some fifty years ago that's how great our generation gap is uh it was the japanese occupation and uh i my schooling was interrupted and then i went to a japanese school and in that japanese school we learn the japanese language and japanese culture and a bit of that has remain in me and at one time we thought that we were the beginning of a new generation you know previously we were in a colonial situation under the british and now we were talking about the greater co-prosperity sphere of the japanese we were talking about japanese culture and we thought that we were you know going some places uh little did we know that uh because going to end so soon of course we we we also experience some of the atrocities and so on but there's another side to it and this is where a writer comes in  you you you you show that there are different facets to a situation even uh in a terrible time like the japanese occupation and let me read you a page from sayonara sinsei which is a a story in the ghost lover as well 
Singapore	anymore people coming in uhm where should we start today now from the from novel to stage uh from novel to stage uhm uh let me just say first that i have i've had only one experience of doing this so you know i'm an authority as such uh because i don't spend my whole uh theatre career translating or tra transforming i use the word the term translating books into plays alright uh very often uh i i i start my work from a from a playwright's work or uh just from the actors uh in fact i very seldom uh uh write stuff myself even when i translate from a novel to to stage from book to a stage the one experience i had i worked primarily with actors to create this experience okay uhm what do you all think is the primarily difference between a novel or a book and a stage any volunteers because once we understand the difference we'll be able to zero in on what exactly uhm we have to do in in this translation right let's look at those uh points uhm i think that straight away one of the one of the uh the the first speaker talked about uh the fact that in uh uh in a in a performance okay i would say that the novel the primary difference first of all is that novel is a written piece of work it's text while stage of course is performance uh we're we're not talking about about translating from a a novel into a into a play we're trans for trans for talking about translation from novel into the stage which which means performance and uh immediately it involves an audience i mean you don't get a situation of of three hundred and sixty people reading from one giant book right i mean reading is a very private experience in a sense that it's a one-to-one relationship with the with the book uh while in a in a theatre you have to think about the audience uhm and about the communion between what's happening on stage and what's happening in the audience okay the the the the the reason why i use the word communion is that it's important to relate to the audience it's not it's not going to be uh enough of a threatrical experience if the actor son stage uh uh uh only relating to themselves and there's nothing no no energy flowing out towards the audience while in a sense for a book it's very different i mean the novelist writes the book and he doesn't have to have any potent energy jumping up from the book uh into into the reader's uh uh uh uh into into the reader's feel/field as such so immediately we come to one main difference in that theatre has to have a dynamism okay the stage has to have a dynamism that means that it cannot be a a a uhm a an experience of just of just uh uh imbibing the atmosphere it has to be a three dimensional experience uh which is immediately another difference between the book which is two dimensional and theatre which is three dimensional because you have uh uh the actors you have the three dimensional sets etcetera etcetera uhm one of you brought up also that it's about it's not just not about thoughts it's also about action okay a primary definition of theatre uh in the olden times okay uh the the uh uh from the greek times is that it only needs three elements fro theatre one is that you need a a a a space okay and uh by a space what is define as space you can just use a chalk to draw up a square on a floor and that is your performance space two you need actors uh uh uh with finally three a conflict okay so you need actors uh relating in terms of actions and number three you need a conflict between the actors okay that's all you need to create a play so you can just have a situation where man a meets man b in a space and uh uh they have uh uh different views about life and from there the clash you know develops and then a piece of theatre can happen okay uh and so in a sense theatre is about action and not just about thoughts theatre is a is a is a playing out of thoughts uhm and the the the the key word the third key word there conflict also relates to dynamism because you can only by dynamic when there is a conflict right okay uh do you understand what i mean by dynamism meaning that uh you can't really have a a a play in which nothing happens i mean you can of course i mean that's that's an experimental well because i myself have done something like that where where nothing really happens backette?? for example okay where nothing really happens uh but within that silence or within the emptiness something is happening that means that you're you're you're you're looking at at uh uh an action happening within space zero or time zero okay uhm and going back to the the the term dynamism and conflict uhm we cannot simply in a sense have people sitting on stage unless you're interested in looking at spatial arrangements and lights and bodies moving in the light that means it becomes a kind of kind of dance ritual or movement ritual okay right while in a book like in thomas hardy famous for pages and pages of scenic description appear on the countryside but you can't really do that in uh uh uh on stage because there isn't any dynamism alright you can you you you can create that panorama of scenery in a film for example and word with with music you know it can be a a a a a a wondrous experience like for example uh uh merchant  word ivory's word films uh it's it's very much that he always rolls as to pan his camera through the the countryside and then there is music and you and you and the au the the the the film goer is left to the sense of what just happen in that last scene in a sense you you you have time to to view the scenery and almost look at the last scene happening between vanessa redgrave and uh uh and whoever uh in a diff different perspective okay but in in theatre it's very very difficult because it's life and so if you actually do uh uh uh moments like that you're going to start to have a restless audience or pockets of restlessness uh happening okay so uh we're talking about dynamism we're talking about conflict we're talking about action uhm and uh in relation to what some of you some of the rest of you brought about soliloquies uh well in in film also you can also have a soliloquy you can have a voice over like in uh uh the translation of tennesse william's uh play into the movie i think john malkerwech?? was talking all the time as the as the brother and he was he was having a solliloquy while uh uh the the movie was moving on okay uhm and also in a in in a book you you also have solliloquies happening because it's a personal uh it's a personal impression of let's say what happened in in cornwall alright or in the uh in in the devonshire alright and he's writing the whole chapter so that's already a kind of solliloquy uhm it's that clear up to this point okay now the theatre being a visual experience okay that's that's uh uh uh extremely important because in yesterday's session with with the the the secondary students i talked about the uh uh uh key words of immediacy the magic of the moment okay that theatre is all about immediacy you must have something happening there and then the emotion must be real the emotion must be true and it cannot be it cannot be something which you can cut and refilm alright so you must have the immediacy and the magic of the moment and hence theatre must be vivid it it's a whole immediate moment where as the audience who sit there and you you either washed over with emotions which are so powferable?? because of what's happening on stage between two characters or you're washed over by the visual experience okay it's so theatre or stage is an experiential uh uh uh experience it's it's it's exactly that you see while in a sense and is of all senses it's it's the play touching all senses sight sound uh sometimes you may have incense in a in a small black box smell uh uh uh uh uh uh all your senses all being stimulated while in a in a book it's different okay uhm we walked some of you talked as well about how uh between a book uh and also a a stage experience there is personal space for the for the audience member what do i mean by personal space meaning that when you read the book you can make your you you can sort of stop reading for a while and just close your eyes and imagine what's happening in a chapter uh but you can also do that in a theatre experience in a sense that you make up your mind as to what's happening on stage uh but there are many plays like some of the plays that i do which are extremely aggressive that means there's no time for you to for you the audience to uh to stop and uh and reflect but you're you're constantly pounded by what's happening on stage but a theatre experience can also be such that the director designs it such that there is space for the audience to breathe and to think about what has happen okay alright uh anyone else brought up points which is not address yes of course that if you're a writer who's very concerned that your every word every feeling must be exact then i recommend that you write a novel instead of a play because uh the the primary creation okay this is a this is a a a an old view okay and i'm i'm just talking about the the the old view the primary creative of drama comes from the writer and the secondary creativity comes from the director and actor alright so that if you are very very uh uh jealous about your work you mustn't write a play because finally the play goes to a group of people who work on your text as a basic starting point so what you may have intented is transformed uh into something else alright okay because there are many ways of uh of of of looking at it i mean a director and a group of actors can say that yes i am keeping to the playwright's intention but within this specific moment i can interpret action a instead of action b and still be within the playwright's intention okay alright do you all understand what i am saying that once you write a play you have other elements coming in because the the actors are not machines they're not robots they're not programmed to think like you you may have intended a a a certain motivation to result in a certain action but uh the actor can reach that action with a different motivation because they're not robots and they're not programmed by you while in a novel you can do exactly that because no one else is going touch your your your your book once it's printed as a novel everyone reads it as it is right while once a play is printed that's only part of the process 
Singapore	uhm i will be dealing with four areas we'll start off with the type of materials that we've got followed by the system that we adopted which is basically how we classify our material followed by how we manage the centre and how we monitor students' performance right we'll start off with the types of material that we've got uhm video tapes lots and lots of entertainment tapes actually and also that keeps us growing especially since well we know that we can tape from tv okay so all videos for entertainment purposes are stored in a cabinet over here and other educational tapes uh we have we store them at the back down there and if these students think word on what how to conduct interviews how to present themselves at interviews how to write uh business letters or reports or how to use body language more effectively okay uh the entertainment videos have been classified into different categories we've got shakespeare and classics which are usually based on some literary text rather like gone with the wind adventure and drama like robin hood prince of thieves terminator 2 uhm we've also got uhm mysteries thrillers and documentaries now under computer materials we classified them under several categories we got quite a lot of help material and uh under games we've got things like scrabble and crosswords assimilations we have games like uhm where in the world is town san diego where you pretend to be detective and you go around the world searching for information to catch a thief under skills we have uhm programmes like speed reader or spell it and uh the next one is language application language application we have a concordancer the one that was uh introduced by longman the mini concordancer which students can use uhm text construction uh things like gap master where students on the white word fill in you know they are given a paragraph with many blank words and then students will just type in words if they're correct they get a nice sound and if they don't they get  word that kind of thing general application software like pagemaker and uhm uh word processing programmes books and magazines you can see we have quite a lot of them will generally on books tend to be short stories because the students that come here don't spend a lot of time so we tend to buy short stories either by local writers or others and uhm we store in at the back over there the magazines we store them here and we subscribe to four times discover readers' digest and teens to cater to a variety of taste the reading column which is a display of books basically tries to encourage them to read the new books that we've got right under audio material i must confess that we have a very very limited supply you can see under the pronunciation tapes uh the worksheets that we've got how few we have but again under educational basically they're on pronunciation and under entertainment we have a few that uhm tell short stories like real dull  word stories okay the main bulk of our facilities are the worksheets that we've got and you okay and you can see them displayed right together and  word alright we classify our worksheets into general and specific general here meaning they test a variety of language areas and uhm specific okay under general worksheets like reading listening they do at at 'o' level basically what we mean they will test things like grammar vocabulary and other word  under the specific worksheets we've got pronunciation vocabulary grammar and special skills uhm the special skills include things like writing a resume writing a business letter and under information skills students are encouraged to learn how to use a thesaurus how to use a dictionary now the materials that we store in the filing cabinets we uh store four copies of each material okay for the students to use and don't know about copyright laws but we store four copies of each uhm worksheet that we've got and uh two answer sheets which we separate which we put at beside uh in the filing cabinets that which you should take a look later the main reason actually for this is that because we find that a lot of our students simply copying the answers if we put them together with the worksheet so it really defeated the purpose so we make them actually we have to walk over there to take the answer sheets so that they can use them okay so now i'll come to the system we've adopted that helps us to classify the materials that we got've we use the two prong word system a vending system for the levels of difficulty and a classification system okay let's look at the vending first and uh if you take a look your handout page one you see a sample of how we classify students' in terms of writing uh the best open book for listening uh speaking reading comprehension and things like that so each one is separate okay so if you take a look at uh page one we actually only offer four levels level four to level seven based on the types of students that we get now actually most of our students are the got like that one meh you know which means they are level four possibly level five yah we don't get any students who are the a one type so most our materials are concentrated on level four and five so if you take a look at this you see that under level four the students should be able to write simple paragraphs without guidance uhm will produces word writing that lacks clarity coherence and relevance uh other than simple paragraphs okay we also use a colour colson colson a colour code to help the students locate the materials easily and for us level four materials which are the simplest are coded yellow level five materials are coded pink uh level six materials are coded blue and level seven seven materials are beige or cream oh under the specs the classification system that helps us to determine what area under vocabulary or grammar if you take a look at page two we categorise our materials quite uh complexly i suppose because you'll see that the classification system we use is very teacher oriented and not really student oriented so under vocabulary for example uhm two one four to us means homonyms and uhm two three zero means affixes in general which means the students don't really know what they're looking for when they look at the materials in there unless they refer to the files on the teacher's desk so if they were to just go to the vocabulary section they just flip out a piece of material that's numbered two three zero generally they don't really know what's it all about they just read the title and it means something like uhm uh affixes you know but they don't really know that that is the category for affixes and there's no don't know if that's really what they want so they just go in they look look whatever looks interesting and then they just take it out so i think that perhaps is a an area we could improve on okay now the materials that we've got basically use a three prong system we have an explanation sheet uhm worksheet and a answer sheet and the explanation sheet and worksheet are kept together near to the filing pockets all the worksheet uh sorry all the explanation sheets are beige in colour that's how the students pick them out well if you look at page three four five and six this is a sample set of materials to do with equerry word name name four zero one and four zero one to us means singular and plural so a student who takes out the worksheet which is from page four and five will see the title singular or plural and will be instruction that says you name me explanation four zero one stroke one well this explanation sheet like i said is found in that same pocket go through this and just pull it out they read the explanation sheet if they need to and then they do the exercise alright by the end of the exercises they are directed to check an answer sheet also follow the same number exactly as in the answer sheet five stroke one okay let me just explain the numbers okay worksheet four stroke one to us means level four and the first worksheet produced under this level so we can have worksheet four stroke two four stroke three which means that more and more worksheets have been prepared and even under the same category but a level five worksheet then will start off again worksheet five stroke one for explanation one zero and so on alright that's how you keep track of our materials okay if however it is a text which deals with reading comprehension on the 'o' levels then the students will be directed to a text not an explanation sheet okay they will go right to the worksheet please take text zero zero zero one in order for you to do this worksheet all our worksheets also are tailored to under an hour so that the students don't have to spend too much time here because we're basically a supplement to their main curriculum they are given curriculum time to come here and sit down and actually work on the materials so this means that they come as and when they are free and this usually means like lunch break or after they finish their classes so they really only come when they have time and it might be just in between classes so the worksheets are all specifically tailored to that  word alright okay now how to use the self-access system itself at the very beginning of our academic year all first year students all scheduled for a half hour visit to the centre that shows them a short video which you will watch and uhm enables them to know what is what this place where the place is and also you know ask questions if they need to so that they can use it more effectively we'll show you the short video okay uhm if you take a look at the brochure you'll see that the system that the students follow is printed for you so you can look at it at your own leisure i'm going to move on now to the management of the of the centre how we take turns to make sure that the centre runs smoothly well under planning of the centre we have one full-time clerical staff who's stationed here from nine to five and there are six lecturers who take turns uh we schedule planning hours to be here from nine to five okay now we get a trade-off of teaching hours if we ran the centre for three hours we get a trade-off of two teaching hours which means that you know is we spend a little bit more time here or you'll have to teach so much alright alright under general supervision we manage things like the students like telling them where to put their bags and files making sure that they don't steal the materials making sure that they don't vandalise they don't bring in their own computer programmes to copy what we've got yah i mean equipment we make sure that if they want to make use the photocopier they ask us for permission and uhm make sure also that they don't use the printer unless we specifically give them permission to uhm under materials we make sure that the students return the materials correctly to the pigeon holes we make sure that uh if the materials need to be filed they are filed in the proper filing pockets because otherwise materials get lost all over the place 
Singapore	hi good morning uhm can you all do me a favour and stand up and stretch because i know how awful it is to sit for a whole hour stand up oh collin very good collin okay make sure that you're ready to loosen up because i'm going to show an r(a movie now alright i was looking through your programme i think you all can sit down now was looking through your programme and i noticed how intensive it is and it's really is heavy weight subject so i thought oh give these kids a break let's show an r(a movie uh sex and violence you know women being raped in bosnia the khmer rouge killing the un peace keepers you know but i and then i was reminded that you all are below eighteen and that's why i have to snipped off a lot of the sex and violence so what's left is ten minute video on journalism which is about as good because there's some violence in it so i hope you all would enjoy it it will give you an idea about what journal journalism is about and and later on i will uhm give you some uh uh a few tips on what takes to write well in journalism okay well i hope you enjoyed that show a bit of a hard sell ha but i hope i think it gives you all a very good idea about what journalism is about and the difference worlds that you have to be very in tune in uhm in not only in singapore but what's happening abroad what's happening uhm in china in soviet union in uhm now russia and uh england anywhere so what i'm going to do is uhm is to give you a micro and to a macro view of the things you should be tuned in uhm and i think the most important thing is as journalist to be tuned into the written word it's the tool of the trade okay like uhm somebody ask me what's so creative about journalism that you know you want to talk about it in the creative arts programme but i think uhm like playwrights like novelists like poets we deal with the written word uhm do you think i can have one that never mind i'm not used to standing still like this you can hear me do i have to off this okay can you hear me ya those behind can you hear me okay thanks okay uhm how do we use words to convey what you want you know what we observe probably find out that's where creativity comes in and i'll like to think of words like so many horses you know like uhm like the poet they probably the horse is probably uhm the show horse where they they re-prance?? the horse around with accessories you know they'll groom them they're in no hurry to get to the finishing line uhm and the playwright and the novelist you can gallop across meadows of im imagination you can even make the horse fly uhm you can even help uh pimples on the on the horse if you want you know so in the playwright use words different and you can imagine thing bestow things onto people that they don't have uhm but for the the journalist the the word is is primary a work horse you have to work it real hard uhm you write it out only for a purpose to inform to educate to stimulate thought or to entertain that's what journalists are for to do these four main functions i repeat to inform to educate to stimulate thought and to entertain and it's often a race you can't afford like to meander around the meadows and uh gaze at the trees and look at the stars you know you just have to get to the finishing line fast or else the magazines and the weeklies which are on sale are like donkeys or goats you know they will overtake you and it'll be very embarrassing if you're a newspaper journalist uhm so no matter how how you love the written word no matter how and and many are like collin you know he's he's a journalist and he loves words the way i do and but then you have to uhm subsume that love you have to be a master over your words you cannot be a slave to the written word so you every word must count on a page and that's where i feel different from playwrights or fits?? a a novelist where where uhm you let words take its own life okay so this is one of the major challenges of uhm this journalism i'm not?? showing you some slides i'm very low tech how do you work this it took me a long time even to uhm operate my my computer magic okay you know alright i think okay now if if uhm if you're not sure what what count for as a journalist imagine if this is your front page you wake up in the morning and you take a copy of the straits times take a cup of the coffee and this is your front page and this was a front page of the straits times in 1865 imagine reading that where do you start and what is it about where is the headline you know uhm and and actually they're talking about the budget you know and and they gives detail about uh what happen at at the budget but uhm who will read it if today do you think anybody buy would buy a front page like this so you have to be very very tune in to society to the habits of your readers to uhm what people want to read and so if you put word all over the page you are no journalist ah uhm another example of the front page of the straits times aren't you glad we evolved so what happen here was that they put advertisements on the front page not information yah and it's very interesting i was so amuse when i was doing my research because can you can you see them quite small ha there's one about milk goats veer?? veer?? veer?? veer?? veer?? they have two gu gujerat?? milk goats with three kids all excellent conditions apply to the printer of this paper they were selling goats on the front page of the straits times so so newspapers change journalists change with the times you know so you have to always be on top of things and and words are are not the only things that you can convey what you want to convey as a journalist so you have to be tuned into the ? ? what you want the words to do for you and the that doesn't mean flooding the whole front page with words uhm and it means giving information and not only and and not only advertisements on the front page and you also have to be tuned into what's happening around you uhm you've to be tuned into the details of things that are happening around you and to be to be a good writer in journalism it's quite different from being a good reporter but i believe that uhm to be a good writer in journal you have to be a good reporter first you know you you must be interested in what's happening around you uhm the more you the more you work to make your writing perceptive insightful stimulating and moving the more you learn to write so that you can capture everything that's happening around you and you present it to the world you know you present it to your readers to hood it up for their imagination but you have to notice the mole on her cheek you have to uhm you have to notice whether she she was she actually uhm she look really sad and then the wrinkles that're on her eyes you know uhm what turn into a tight fan when she was telling you about how her husband died you know uhm uhm you have to notice uhm details like if she she tells you he's a ? ? that once i i interviewed this guy who was accused of raping a girl and he says no no no uhm i uhm he he he maintained that the gi uhm the girl agreed to having relations with him and at the end wanted to give him trouble and cried rape and he was sitting there saying i had sex with forty women in my whole life he's about forty years old and he was wearing this china t-shirt with uhm made in china slippers you know and ? ? with trousers with holes and he was telling me oh i drive a sports car and women like me because i'm like a hong kong superstar you know and he was there you know with china t-shirt so you have to match reality with what is being told to you and that's come from being a good journalist you not only hear what people are telling you but you match it with what you see so you've to be very tuned in to to the details of uh the people you're talking to or to the surroundings so i feel that the writer sees better and more clearly than the non-writer if you're if you love words and i'm sure you all do being creative people you find that you'd be even a better reporter if if you go there as someone who loves words and even as the event you're covering unfolds be a parliament session you know where i've got to sit through for six hours or a murder or a big fire you have always to be tuned in to what's going on you must be thinking about how to write you know you can't like sit down and said well switch off and then i'll i'll get codes later on and i'll come back to the office and i'll just it'll come it'll come you know it doesn't work that way you have to think on your feet you know even as ministers let's say are giving their speeches in parliament then you have to be consciously thinking what are the points he's making is he worth any space you know uh what's his argument is it is it valid if it's you know false?? and and you must know as good writers you must know that writing is more than putting words on a page good writing is a process of observing digesting thinking and explaining uhm and for for for features you must think in terms of not only of writing but you must also think in terms of from one thought to the other and you have to think in terms of endings as well as the headings how you start the story what we call intro you must also think in terms of the endings the endings give a sense of completion to the reader i'll give an example of a recent feature i did just publish yesterday uhm it was about old folk's homes uhm their they're they take up a whole floor of a hdb block and now they're expanding to a second floor you know and lives?? in ang mio kio and i'm sure you all know about the case in dover park hospice you know and uhm the st andrew hospital for the elderly where the all the neighbours made a lot of noise about having these old people nearby they think they're sick and dying no we don't want to catch their uhm their diseases you know they don't want to be expose to death when they're so young in their prime of health uhm so with this new expansion of this elderly in this hdb block in ang mio kio 
Singapore	what i like to do now is to take you through from the world of uh the literary uh you know from authorship to the fairly realistic pragmatic world and uh basically what i'll like to talk about is bridging the world between uh you know where authors are books the creative uh industry with you know uh earning your bread and butter and getting that done uh so being quite consistent with singapore's thrust towards entrepreneurship uh in a pushing towards uh you know enterprise uh at the same time now first of all about the book itself the travels of wiglinton and wenks are really to help promote educational values among the children who are reading it particularly geography so the first four books of the series cover the first book is on london and paris alright so it covers the uh travel taste of uh the adventures of wi wiglinton and wenks in london and paris the next one is on venice and rome the third one is one is on istanbul and turkey and the fourth is malta and singapore and the fifth will be on china called the china doll and the reason why i'm covering uh these various countries with you is it because if you can find a programme or a book that uh you know provides you with uh opportunities on travel this would be a lovely business to be in and that's the business we're in because in anyway in order for us to be able to the the books and to have them uh drawn all three of us have got to travel uh and do research so the first thing about bridging worlds uh in terms of writing is the fact that you've got to go into research which is partly you know facts that's what faction is all about in you know in whatever documents you come up with whatever books or essays you intent to write and have to write you've got to do the fundamental research and in this case it is really pleasurable because you've got to go visit the countries and the cities and you've got to get the very good feel of uh the facts and you've got to get them right because otherwise you know children will be picking up all the inaccurate information so let's put it this way the reason why it is uh geared for six to a hundred is because if you've never been to turkey and uh you've not been to istanbul if you were to read the book you would get very good facts about the culture of the countries that you're uh that the books are all about you'll get lovely illustrations of uh some of the major uh things which are in the city and the country so the research is really to provide stimulus for writing because you can't live in a isolation if i were to put you a square box in a room on your own and expect you create out of nothing it's is often very difficult uh on the other hand by interacting with people by being here for instance and having spend a week uh talking to your peers and talking to speakers perhaps and having an exchange you get the stimulus you need often to get your work done secondly nothing uh you know it's better than getting a feel of this of the situation if you're writing about uh in a cultures about people uh there is nothing more im important than getting a feel of the situation the climate what are the attitudes like you know how do people feel about the country how do they feel in terms of uh the the kind of celebrations that they have and what's the joy they get uh in these places or perhaps some of the problems that they're experiencing the third of course is to make it authentic because one of the key things about writing uh and about you know function is you got to provide a certain basis for which people can identify with with the the things which are being done so it's a very nice uh fin final balance between reading a book for instance the book on turkey if a turk uh were to read it and uh for instance the ambassador of turkey were to read this book he should be able to say yes it is quite accurate it is quite authentic uh there's no thrill you know uh uhm bull-shiting around with the facts however one of the key things also is you got to realise that if you're writing children's books you are actually writing also the positive side so one of the key things you might say to yourself is that if you've got nothing really nice to say about something don't say it now that's the position of censorship which i think is interesting given this audience because i'm sure one can go into a debate about whether censorship uh you know is right or wrong i realise you've had irene ng from the the straits times before as a speaker i don't know what she's covered but uh you know people would i think think in terms of what is the role of censorship or self censorship in a country uh like ours and one of the key things i would say is this that if you are looking into writing about cross-cultures you've got to be responsible and when i talk about responsible authorship i'm saying you have to be sensitive about the multi-right racial elements in any societies uh they're other countries with different religions you've got the multireligious states you have also got a a lot of different cultures and because of this sensitivities you've got to i think be responsible which means sometimes you've got tell yourself that uh you know if you have nothing nice about it don't say it uh and you know uh do that and you've also got to bear in mind that the product meets the objectives and reinforces the value you are trying to promote for example if you look at uh what's happening in turkey turkey is essentially uh uh islamic country i mean islam is the major uh you know religion in turkey so you've got to be very careful in the way you protray the mosque make sure that they're accurate make sure that uh you know you give enough uhm uhm recognition to uh you know the uhm religion uh of the countries uh in maltar which is very very catholic you'll find lots of illustrations about you know catholicism the cathedrals the festives and the festivals that they celebrate similarly in rome you've got vatican so you cover that as well and i'm saying that when you're dealing with sensitive uh issues on religion and races and the different cultures you've got to be very wary in singapore for instane you see uh one of the sketches about rajagopal now rajagopal is called the wise one and he's the one in little india who helps wiglinton and wenks uh find out where the clue to the next map in singapore is and in singapore because of the multi-racial system you will find that in the book uh you we've represented all the races you've got the chinese you know you got the eurasian manager of the orchid factory you've also got the uhm you know uh malay inspector who help them to interpret the clue so these are all some of the things you have to bear in mind when you are writing for the world stage and i think the important thing to bear in mind is this the justification i think for self-censorship is really to look at what is the objective you are trying to achieve and may if you're going to write on something else you know something different uh you may uh then decide to be less strict with yourself as far as that's concern but i think given the kind of objectives that you are trying to to move in the product and the kind of values you're gonna try and promote in in terms of uh you know green heritage uh preservation non-violence these are some of the things that you got to bear in mind when you're writing and i welcome questions and we all welcome questions after this on on the point of uh contention i think right coming back to bridges i think one of the key things uh in taking this dimension of uh the programmme further is to take a look at the products and the services that you will be producing for example many of you will be writing short story hopefully you would like to publish your own books one day or even publish uh script for a play one of the thing you got to then uhm begin to bridge is the literary world of the author with the world of commerce which is the reader which is how do you get your product which is the book or the play and the service which is educational one assumes or exposure of stimulus whatever it is uh that you define as the objective to the end reader is the end user or the consumer how do you get the actual product into the hands of the person who's going to buy hopefully the product and therefore in terms of what bridges you got to look at two views the publishing first of all getting the book into print and out on the table and the marketing and public relations and promotion uh you know involve where publishing is concerned i think many of you would tend to have uh uh come to a decision point whether you are going to raise or the finance yourself uh and therefore have the money yourself to put behind getting the books into print and publishing it which means you've got uh ultimately uh control of uh the what goes into the book you don't have to go through uhm such a tough editing process from a publishing houses you'll find i mean obviously you need editors to go through your books to make sure that they are readable and in a readable state but you could decide to finance yourself and go ahead and publish the books on the other hand like many other writers if you can't afford to do that you got to then approach publishing houses and in singapore one of the nicest things is that there the publishing trade is actually now quite open and some of the people who i think have been on this programme are actually supporting local authors and i think the trade is uh really growing so you could submit your scripts to the publishing houses and they will normally come back to you and negotiate around what should be edited in what should be edited out what's is sell sell sellable etcetera so that's really the decision point you have to make in terms of publishing where marketing is concern that's the entrepreneurship many authors tend to just say i've done my job i've written the book it's now with the publishers it's in in just the basic form and that's it you know and uh leave the marketing and public relations very much to chance or sometimes if they have a good publisher the publisher would normally organise you know the launch party the uhm press release etcetera so this very much depends on how active one wants want one wants to be but one of the key things uh that you know that we are thinking and and sharing with you is that you may have to think public relations you may have to think promotions and you may have to get down into the market to actually get your books going 
Singapore	thank you mister chairman well i'm not going to talk about you know sexual problems or things like that tonight but uhm the talk is actually on stress management strategy and uh i shall make it a very practical session so afterwards you know you all will have to have maybe you space yourself out and shift the chairs a little because you will need some room we're going to uh go through a few of the techniques and there are different types uhm i shan't be doing too much theory but i thought you know perhaps you know i'll just have this one transparency we talk about stresses and the general concept of stress so basically you know there's for any individual lah you have the stressor the stressor can be anything depends on each person it could be your family your marriage your work relationship anything you know that stresses you we call the stressor and then you know you go to this uh through different interfaces with one self and with that person himself so first you have got the appraisal how you look at stress or maybe you look at the situation let's say you've got an exam uhm or you know your husband is going to leave you or your work in office due to over work and all that how do you appraise it and appraisal maybe it depends on how you look at things some things you see as unpleasant some things are challenging some things are threatening and this depends on lots of other factors you know on what that has happen in the past you know how you face the si stimulus situation how you face exams or how you face work stress or how you face you know quarrel with your husband that sort of things so and it depends on also your knowledge you know knowledge about a certain thing how much you think you know about the situation as subject in a way you've experience of it your judgement of it you know you're judging it and as you know being serious not too serious moderately serious is it okay it's not too bad and all that uh then things like you know how predictable it is lah if it's something that comes on in a very predictably and you know the outcome you know what's going to be like then your reaction is going to be different as from something that just comes out of the blue if it's terrible it's your fault and then you know you don't have anything to guide you and there's a situation what's the situation surrounded surrounding this uh ? ? this uh stress at the moment okay so this one uh is going to then you look at the outcome uh what you expect of the outcome uh you think it's going to be a good outcome or bad outcome so probably you know we do that lah most of the time but probably we don't have it in a structure but you generally like some sort of expectation i think it's terrible suppose to be collapsing soon uh i will not be able to survive it and then it's going to be so bad i think i better end my life so that will become someone expecting the worse outcome well you think well perhaps it's not so bad that type of thing then uhm you look at the you know efficacy of expectations uh whether you think you know how efficacious uh certain things are going to be you know what strategies what you're going use and whether it's going to be useful or not and the commitments that you have uhm in relation to that stress uh what commitments do you have to that situation and that will help you decide you know because your options are going to give them what commitment you have if you are overly committed or heavily committed then you may be able to you may be unable to you know have the option of leaving that stress or that stressful situation now other things will be on your personality and here a lot of work has been done so uhm you all may have heard of the type a and type b type of personality there has been a lot of work done and initially it was use you know almost about uh two three decades ago about you know cardiac disorders you know cardiac disorders and the type a type of personality so that you know it was represented with a clench fist and a and a stopwatch uh if they say those who are most prone to mild cardiac problems lah uh let's say infarctions heart attacks and all that they're the ones who are very very tense they're very ambitious they are very impatient and uh they have to do things all the time on the go and that's why you have this clench fist and suggesting a lot of tension inner tension and also the stop watch a stop watch has seen a lot of singaporeans and a stop watch in their minds that means everything must be done on time if the thing is a bit slow uhm certain things happen they become very frustrated and they're very uptight about it so this is the type a personality and it was found that within type a personality you are prone to uhm cardiac problems but now in the whole context has been widen so that they look at this personality and gastric ulcer this personality and a lot of variety of things so basically if you do have that part if you can uh then you can change it uh preferably to the type b personality type b is the opposite of it you're very laid back you don't care till you know sky can come down and say well it's not too bad and all that so gives him a very laid back type of personality and probably in terms of the singapore context if you're too type b again i suppose it's not too good okay but anyway this is the personality type that you have and the other one is the locus of control again a lot of work has been done well this uh control basically means that a situation happens how much are you in control of it can you control or you can't control it okay whether let's say uhm examinations can you control the outcome or not generally i think where exams are concerned ah we have quite a good locus of control basically i mean if you have uhm let's say sufficient you have the intellectual level and you know you know you study hard and you go through the past question your chances of passing should be about ninety per cent there'll be ten per cent chance of failing you may not do you may not reach a but your chances of passing are good so your locus of control is good but suppose you know you go into a situation where the external locus of your control is an external locus of control that means you're working in a situation where you have a very erratic boss everything depends on him he's very high-sailing but he's very erratic and you don't know where you stand you have to look at the face one day he's happy the other day he's not so he gives you that type of stress it can be very bad i think of some people those who have been in the army sometimes you know you face uh uh a difficult ? ? he may give you hell because you may not be able to predict it's totally out of your control so in that situation you can feel very helpless and the stress can be great and another thing at the end a lot of work being done on social support what we know is that the more support you have the better you are able to cope so let's say now the stressor you go through this and then you look at your coping strategies ah there are different types of coping strategies one is problem focus one is emotion focus we'll go through the strategies later and that depends your outcome depends on that if it's a bad outcome you will get your either psychological problem uh into well i was talking suicidal behaviour and all that and even you know while it was mention sexual disorders uhm you can get physical problems and physical problems can be anything because uh lots of things are actually in a way the relationship between strength and ailment there are several what we call psychosomatic disorders that means you're quite related to stress and others which are a bit more diffused ah but again a lot of work is being done on that or if you have been all these factors are good then your outcome can be satisfactory right so this is uh a basic uhm outcome of the concept of stress and now we will go straight into the management strategy i shall be dealing you know with uh two of these and not all of them now these are the general ones as in relaxation hypnosis and imagery and tonight i would like to cover it and then later on we go onto the more cognitive ones how do you change your way of thinking so the first one is uh is relaxation therapy and uhm perhaps you know if you can do now can you all shift around uh so that you have enough space uh to be able to stick your legs out now the issue of relaxation therapy is that you know you have to learn how to relax and you have to relax your muscles ah so this one is what we call the peripheral method meaning that you know the theory is that if your muscles are relaxed you're going to be able to relax okay some people will find that you know it is so if they relax muscles then they can relax themselves but some people may not be able to do that and that's why we have you know different other techniques later on okay so initially this was started by jacobson?? in the nineteen thirties and uh what he said was like i said the principle was that if you relax your muscles then your whole mind will relax many people find that they cannot tell whether their muscles are tense or relax lah so what we did was have a series of exercises which focus uh on tension that allow you to then you know what it means when your muscles are tense and what that means when your muscles are relaxed so what i shall do is now i would like all of you to now just tense your muscles really grip hard and tense everything clench you know clench your your legs and then your hands and bite as you know really hard really hard and as you do that focus fully on your body focus on the tension of your legs your arms your teeth and all that really tense tense tense tense now relax just relax and as you relax just focus on your muscles how it feels when they are relaxed so this one is very important because this is uh something you got to learn about your body how it feels ah to be tense and how it feels to be relaxed what i shall do is to go through the whole series and what we'll be doing is to tense and relax you know different muscle groups as you tense and relax just focus on that part and don't tense or relax the other parts so if i say the feet ah just tense your feet and so on and so don't just focus on that  and uh try to get a system because obviously this is something if you want to use you've got to practice lah 
Singapore	we had a special viewing session in the museum last night for some very special people so they were going through the whole of museum from one room to another gallery and so on and at the end of this whole tour there was going to be a reception for them in the conference room there will be drinks there will be cakes and so on so there was this show known as mo tau the ink paintings in singapore that was right before the conference room after walking through the whole museum the whole group just went past the whole exhibition just because there was food at the end of it and that's quite natural and your lunch time is like uh what thirty-five minutes from now and you must be happy so we should keep to just thirty-five minutes and uh hopefully you know we can uh go through with and i'm interested in having a dialogue discussion with you more than anything else because i understand that you're a group of writers are you not and i do not know how much you're interested in art i was saying i do not know how much are you all are interested in art uh i certainly hope to use this use this very short uh session that i have with you to talk about at what points we can cross-reference art history and literal history and what kind of inspirations that you know again art could draw from writing and writing could draw from the visual arts uh the talk that i'm going to have is called art and identity: ink painting in singapore i gave this title over a long-distance phone call and somebody decided to be creative along the way and to add the word creative which makes no identity but it is art and identity and not necessarily a creative identity uhm the the point is uh i'm i'm giving this talk in conjunction with the current exhibition that we have at the national museum the one that i mention mo tau uh ink paintings in singapore uhm uh ink paintings or you all might better know the medium as chinese paintings then again whether these paintings are chinese is a point of contention you know this is precisely some of the things that we could discuss about uh it is better to use the more technical term ink painting as in as in the ink medium uh the exhibition that we are having tries to capture to talk about in particular history in particular development of this medium of paintings in singapore over the past fourteen years or so the actually i'm keen to find out are you all interested in art at this pace do do you all like paintings yes no no sorry uh okay okay okay okay uh we may say that the beginning of art in singapore i mean we do this for reasons of writing an art history of singapore as the point when nanyang academy of fine arts was establish in 1938 have you heard of nanyang academy of fine arts which is a art school well-known art school uh very established art school in singapore now this school was established in 1938 and when the school was established it was modelled after similar art academies in shanghai in china shanghai was then the arts centre of shang uh of of china in the 1950s now if you go back further back into chinese uh history twentieth century history uh you'll you'll you'll recall that you know early twentieth century late nineteenth century was the point when the chinese learned along from the west and they got this a lot of western technology western ideas and so on and try to integrate this western uh technologies and idea with chinese tradition so when the art academies were establish in shanghai in the twenties and thirties they had uh basically two departments one is known as chinese ink painting the other one is xiyang hua or western art and the two departments could never really integrate because to begin with we're talking about very different uhm uh artistic uhm uh traditions at artistic or aesthetic traditions and same as for singapore when it came to singapore when this moder of art academy came to singapore in the late 1930s nanyang academy of fine arts also started with two departments the chinese painting department the western painting department even up to today you know this uh dichotomy is still very problematical now in this exhibition we're organising we try to look at the history of singapore art just plan from the view of a single medium ink painting and uh in doing so we try to see how by looking from this point of view by looking specifically from this perspective what kind of questions we can generate what kind of issues what kind of discussions we can generate in discuss in talking about the history of art in singapore so uh have the nanyang style have you heard of this term uh do some of you do art major are are you doing art as a paper in your 'a' level you are just writers and nothing else okay okay uh okay let me see how i should say this there was a group of artists in the early 1950s uh namely uh chen wenxi zong sutien uh cheng chon cheng chong swee and liu kan who went for a field trip in bali in 1952 uh specifically so during this trip they captured many of the balinese sceneries balinese culture people and so on and this field trip that they made in the in 1950 uh in the early 1950s when they came back they actually uh a new genre of painting known as nanyang style basically they integrated chinese ink with western methods of ink painting and using balinese subject matters in the 70s and 80s when we started talking looking at our own art history when singapore started looking started looking our own art history we then identified the nanyang style of the 1950s as our first art movement so you know this is a fairly nationalistic uh retrospective of our own art history and we were searching for an art movement that we could call our own is like the americans calling the abstract expressionism as the american the beginning of american art you know america finally became independent culturally from their european counterparts and started its own uh artistic movement so same as for singapore in the seventies and eighties we started considering nanyang style as our own at the same time uh new arty younger artist who studied at nanyang academy of fine arts in the late sixties in the early seventies and so on started doing their fine arts studies abroad so some went to london some went to new york and so on uh others went to paris so when they came back they brought uh brought back with them many new ideas especially about uh abstract expressionism internationalist artistic directions so in the seventies and eighties the whole discussion of visual arts in singapore was very much uh uh at two ends of the spectum on the one hand you have the nationalistic approach to look at nanyang style as in the art movement in singapore and on the other hand you you have the internationalist approach to look at international trend from america and so on as a international art style which we should have the ink painters in the meantime you know this this group of people continued to paint paint in the traditional ink media now even the word traditional is questionable because some of them actually evolve you know from the traditional approach to ink to to be more innovative and to do new things and so on uh they found themselves being caught in in a awkward position because they were not internationalist uh painters in the sense of doing abstract art and they were also not nationalist painters in the sense of doing?? nanyang style art they were traditionalist painters yes uh by association of the ink medium regurgitation of chinese painting however because singapore continued uh to have exchanges with china after the end of cultural revolution in china so many chinese artist from mainland china came to singapore they sold their works in singapore and many buyers of art in singapore collectors by virtue of this artist coming from mainland china they were taught to be more chinese or more uh authentic than the local ink painters so it was a period for them it was a very low key period because they were neither here nor there you know they could not find themselves uh a niche in the nationalist uh paradigm they could find themselves in position in the internationally uh outlook uh they could not find themselves even a position in the traditionalist approach to art so this is when national museum uh our task at the museum is always to research to interpret present the art history of singapore not in any simplistic manner but always we try to show the picture as complex as we can in order to be as true to the actual development as we can and hence we put together this exhibition to show that uh in any development of visual arts and i'm sure it should be the same for writing for the literaly history uh we have to be very careful about using any simplistic uh schematisation of looking at the developments but we always have to see the actual reality of a very complex picture of a very diverse picture of development uhm now i'm just going to talk a little bit about identity because the development of singapore art has a lot to do with the identity of singaporean chinese now i'm not saying that the museum is only interested in chinese art of course but we happen to be dealing with this topic as this point and you know we are also interested for instant uh next year we are having an exhibition on indonesian art and so on so we're always interested in looking at things from other ethnic groups' point of a view when a why you know the question here is why is chen wenxi chong cheng chong swee uh chen suying and liu kan go to bali in the early fifties and why did they start a nanyang style uh we argue in the current exhibition that one way of looking at this is to go back again to china to shanghai in the 1920s and 30s because after the may fourth uh movement in shan in china uh what was really introduced to the visual arts education in china was western representational painting or naturalistic painting or or representation sorry i mean or uh realist painting at the point when you know of course uh this was a period of judaism it was it was a period of phobism?? and so on when when the west began to be more interested in abstract paintings but what the chinese learn from the west they were really more interested in realism for very specific historical reasons because artist were intellectuals and they wanted to communicate with the public at large and therefore the best means to do so is through the medium of representational painting so this you know in china later on we have people like shi feihong and so on who establish art schools in in a art schools and also uh specific painting styles to integrate chinese ink paintings and western art and in singapore in a way the nanyang style is a later development of this early culture renaissance in china in the early twentieth century that's one way of looking at it so in a way the nanyang style was part of the may fourth impulse that finally develop into a kind of uhm uh south-east asian chinese art that started off with with the inspiration of the early twentieth century 
Singapore	a little bit more of myself yah so yah this proves you all that i know what i am talking about uhm basically a newspaper is a eighteen hour operation everyday so uhm you can't expect one person to work the whole eighteen hours and that's why i'm called the night news editor because there's a transition period uhm from between two and four o'clock every evening when someone takes over the day day editor's work and that's when i come in and probably stay through till about twelve every night to get the pages and stories out okay reason why i pick the newmen's english is that i notice uh many people like you and uh got flair for the language skills good command good command of it but uh when you come into a newsroom situation uhm you find it a little difficult to adapt to what a newspaper demands a newspaper demands something that's totally different from writing your novels your poems and what have you and i notice that there's been a normally it takes students between two to three months before they get the hang of writing for a newspaper so i thought i pick this and just let you all know what it takes and uh give you an idea of the skill that uhm writing for a newspaper requires and uh don't bother taking down notes because i've made a whole set of uhm notes knowing uh how fastidious uh students at the moment are in taking notes so i made a whole set and i'll distribute them to you later okay now i also got few uhm two exercises and depending on time we'll do either one or both of them later on they just just to give give you a feel of what what it is okay newmens's english now this will give you an overview of what it means this was uhm from a famous book by harold evans who wrote a series of harold evans is the former editor of the london times and the sunday times okay now he came across this sign and he thought to himself that's just three words too much and basically what what we do as newspaper man is keep it as short and simple as possible so uhm going to this sold fish you don't need to see fresh say fresh because uhm like he says there he no one will sell tell you that they're selling stale fish to you they don't have to say sold because you're not gonna word  give that away and you don't have to say here because you would'nt be doing it at home would you okay so basically what we all need here is just fish right that's that's the essence of uh writing for newspaper keep that as short and simple as possible first of all because your reader is not gonna have a lot of time for you on average a a newspaper reader spend between fifteen and twenty minutes reading them which means you got that's not hardly enough even for the ads okay do you want to read a paper from cover to cover it takes you at least three hours and most people don't have that kind of time they take twenty minutes every day just grasp at the headlines and and and basically just have an idea of what the newspaper is saying and also because the the newpaper has to complete with other things like tv you see it's much easier to turn on the tv and watch cnn or sbc news or bbc news and just not think reading requires some effort okay so that's what we do basically okay from time to time i'll put up some quotations on on the subject on famous journalist writers and uh editors because just to uh spice things up a little okay i think a lot of people are concern about the style of writing you know you want to be colourful you want to do this you want to do that and you forget that you know you're not writing for yourselves you're writing for your reader so basically have something to say and say it clearly that means most of the time using the most simple words available so that is the core skill of journalism your your language you need to have that kind of language not not five syllable word not seven syllable words one two syllable words keep it simple of course that varies from newpaper to newpaper the newpaper for instance has a totally different style from the from the straits times okay because the newpaper generally pitch at a younger audience who are you know grammar maybe it's not what it should be or or even hasn't gotten there yet and on the other hand business times is pitch at much higher audience than the straits times so they use or verbose language okay what does good news writing requires language is specific conferring and concise sentences which are clear at first glance if someone has to read a sentence twice then you've already lost him or her okay preference for sentences in the active voice basically telling stories so you need to communicate clearly to the reader no one wants to see the what past tense and you know things like that that just make it boring for everybody else and assertive sentences i've given two examples here don't say the project was not successful just say it was a failure okay can can everybody see from the back now a lot of people have the preference for this kind of thing especially uh uhm public relations officers and uh civil servants they think that the more words you use the the better it comes across and it it can be more authoritative if you read a a sentence that says the project was not successful and you tend to get a a feeling that the writer is trying to say something important right because you're using you're using more words but for a newspaper just keep it simple just say the project failed yah every every word has to add something to a sentence so you just it's basically economy of the language we we don't want yah we call a spade a spade why call it the factor of production first of all you'll have your average reader wondering what you're talking about and secondly yah uses two more words than just saying a spade an abstraction should be preceded by a particle now the the the newsmen's uh aim is basically to simplify everything for his reader so don't say that so and so brought a piece of property which is twenty hectares like a large for twenty millions dollars that doesn't mean anything okay so that's why we always if we notice if we we read our stories we talk about land or something we always have something like football field if twenty hectares how many football fields is that fifteen you know straight away you have an idea of what fifteen how big fifteen football fields are rather than twenty hectares which can be as big as this room or you know even smaller no one i mean that's just makes your reader think and you and you don't want to him you know competing between a dictionary and the story that you've written so try to make it as close as to tv as possible if you want to put it that way and this is the big problem use editors to define not daunt many people have uh i've got some examples later you know news editors like they were going out of style meaning meaningless modifiers that's what that's basically the same thing watch for meaning you'll to say it clearly and precisely because you want to tell your reader what exactly you're you're saying rather than again had him go and figure out whether you know is he talking about this or is he talking about something else so that's that's where precise language comes in avoid cliches i think you see them all the time in our sports pages and things like that so maybe the message hasn't gotten through yet okay once is enough twice is re word three time is a felony use uhm terms sparingly don't don't use the same thing over and over again until it becomes boring staccato to the reader okay here are some example to what i'm talking about i think they speak for themselves lah every word must add to a sentence you would have everybody running for a dictionary and wondering what exactly he meant uhm same goes on the adjectives favourites of uh many of our interns students who come and work for us during the holidays and things like that they like to do things like that split second of eerie silence the thunderous roars okay roars are always thunderous if they weren't they weren't couldn't be called roars yah yah modifiers rather unique you know people will always like to say oh he's rather nice she's rather pretty the lecture was rather unique it's either unique or it isn't and that's there's another example someone scald scalded by hot water if it was cold water you wouldn't have been scalded and there's some examples of cliches at the bottom so that basically is uh the language that you that people want to write for newspaper or write for newspaper should use now i go on to news stories and uh how how they should written and okay i give you about five minutes to read the first paragraph to see if you can figure it out okay one of the good example is the bottom one the top one is uh totally word  charles dicken's example uh by the time you get to the fifth word you're already saying oh forget it i'm not i'm not going to bother with the rest of it the other one on the other hand fifteen words and tells you the whole story right so introductions are the first one or two paragraphs that tell you new stories we call them intros for short american newspapers call them leads we're more towards the british style so we call them intros right the first two paragraphs of every story is the most important part of the story now you have to use your intro to grab the reader if a reader looks at your intro and says this is boring he is not going to read the rest of the story okay i think they carry out surveys on various us newspapers and and the average uh time a reader spends on each uh story is he reads up to the fifth or sixth paragraph and then that's it unless he's really very interested in so you have to get him interested in right from the start and that's what intros are suppose to do and this is what it should be short to the point and generally thirty words is the accepted maximum you read straits times although sometimes you you you see a bit more for maybe political stories which require more explanation and but generally use thirty words alright of course the other extreme is using too few words like in this example here a man died yesterday well sure but how and a man died yesterday is not half the exciting as talking you see there's detail and she will come to later so that's another part of the language that that uhm we have to use carefully of course if we have to read an intro once i think i said this before if you have to read it more than once and still can't digest the meaning it has fail really what intro shouldn't have is questions never ask your reader a question because it's most of them can't answer it anyway 
Singapore	good afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome to the lexmark product announcement perhaps uh from major announcement of the year let me first of all extent a warm welcome to all our customers and also i understand our friendly competitors who are with us today i would like to congratulate most of you who have come here through the heavy rain i understand that is going on outside or uh has it stop since i've been in here i know most of you would have a busy schedule and i'm delighted to have the opportunity to present to you the latest lexmark family of printers we are very excited and optimistic about this new product in the next thirty odd minutes i hope to cover all these new benefits the that our new range of printers are going to provide you and i hope you'll be so persuaded that when you think of lexmark when you think of laser printers it is either the ibm laser printers or the lexmark laser printers so announcing today may fourth the new ibm laser printer series forty thirtynine we are announcing four new models today namely the forty thirty-nine ten r the forty thirty-nine twelve r the forty thirty-nine twelve l the forty thirty-nine sixteen l as you can see on the board the printers speed range from ten pages per minute sixteen pages per minute in other words our printers today are targeted not so much to low-end but at the medium to the lan printers range our existing range of laser printers the forty twenty-nine continue to be current line products from the chart you can see that forty twenty-nine which is a ten-page per minute machine will be positioned slightly below the forty thirty-nine ten r at the lowest end we continue to offer a very low end printer the forty nineteen e what i'm going to cover next in the next two charts is really uh to present to you some of the things that uh we've discovered from talking to customers from speaking to our dealers things that we believe you as our customers find important in our laser printers i'm sure that you would recognise that these are the things that you look for when you're buying a laser printer and i guess uh each of these will be more important than the rest to uh each and the individual one of you print quality ease of operation compatibility to all the applications that you're running your ability to connect the laser printer that you buy to your local area network you want your printer to support all the protocols that you're running in your local area network and of course you want your printer to be of a reasonable speed if not fast paper handling i guess uh most of you would be aware i mean uh we use transparency we use uh all sorts of paper uh text rough texture alright we have thick paper and all sorts alright as we speak to the customers we also told that uh hey we buy a laser printer it cost a few thousand dollars how do you protect my investment customers today are getting more sophisticated they are printing more and more sophisticated thing from the laser printers they want to know if they can store fonts or forms in the laser printers so that the they can have a faster print out without having to down load the uh the forms or logos from the computer being real image conscious i think a lot of companies support today the environment friendly movement and when you buy a laser printer i i would imagine that you would choose a product that is environment friendly last but certainly not least especially in a competitive market like singapore i think the price performance is certainly a key buying criteria for most of you having gone through some of these uh features that i would imagine most of you would look for i think we put together a printer that is what we call uhm packed with features that are customer driven let us look at what some of these benefits that you can enjoy from this uh ibm lasers range uh sorry lexmark ibm printers in my discussions with uh a lot of the customers one of the things that was single out most is compatibility when uh one buys a laser printer a customer hey when i bring the printer back to my company i just want to uh plug the printer on i don't to change the drivers i don't want to change whatever configurations that i've already put into my software in other words they want to plug the printer and play so to speak alright so the the the ibm forty thrity-nine laser printers today are designed as we what we term as plug and play how do we do this the forty thirty-nine printers come standard with the pcl five and the postscript uh data screen as standard in other words most of you whose applications are running on pcl five or postscript will find that you would have no problem with data screen support if you are a macintosh well we have the apple-top option that you could easily plug on and then use this highly competitive machines in a macintosh environment certainly second on the list must surely be ease of use when you buy a laser printer and you put it in your company different people use it and different people with uh different skill levels so you must make sure that the laser printer is easy to use so when we ship the printer today we ship it to what we call a quick start set up utility what is this this is a series of diskettes that we put into the uh box that when you open it you can uh run this into pc and you realise that these diskettes contain the popular drivers for the drivers for you popular applications it provides you with uh help screens that help you in store your printers in whatever configuration you want and basically the bottom line is to make installation so easy that you generally do not have to read the manual or call your dealer up to help you with it the forty thirty-nine following the tradition of the forty twenty-nine where we have had a very intuitive operator panel to make it easy for the end-users the forty thirty-nine comes with a four-line display alright uh i can assure you that this operator panel is very easy to use very intuitive hard for me to stand here and convince you i guess but uh what i would encourage you to do is when this session is over the machines are placed behind i would encourage each each of you to look at the machines and try out the panel for yourself and i'm sure you would agree with me that the panel is very easy to use having said that you need to plug and play it means that the printer must be smart enough to know what data stream is coming to it so we've packed into the forty thirty-nine what we call the smart switch the smart switch feature will sniff out for you the data stream of the file that you're that sending to the printer in other words if you were if your printer is on pcl 5 font and a postscript file is coming on the printer will know it's a postscript file and automatically switch to postscript alright so in other words uh no operating complication and no garbage print we have have what we call the automatic port sensing alright the printer comes with standard a serial port a parallel port and ability for you to hook up a internal network adaptor card so in other words for you to print from each of these ports your printer is smart enough to detect where the signals are coming into which port and uh having detected which is your active port you must know how to switch so automatic port setting comes standard and that makes it very easy to use just like the forty thirty twenty-nines the new laser printers have got the print cartridge in stored when it is shipped so that makes it easy for you again when you open the box the print cartridge is already in the printer and uh again finally but not the least you have a laser printer that is small in size light in weight especially if you compare the lan model the forty thirty-nine sixteen l when you compare it to some of the uh local area network printer out in the market you would realise that we've got a printer that is of a very small foot print but yet do the job of being a lan printer now print quality why would one want to buy a laser printer i guess uh first and foremost we want to have excellent print quality because it affects our image after all when we launch the dates fourteen twentynine laser printer we say it's your image make the most of it so the laser printers ability to do a six hundred dot per inch resolution we have the what we call the print quality enhancement technology this is a curve smoothing technology that is now available in the six hundred dots per inch environment in other words you get sharper print than ever the laser printers today come with a new technology that lexmark has incorporated called the picturegrade this is a image enhancement technology now with this technology it allows the uh lexmark laser printers to print up to to print images right with up to one hundred shades of grey the number of shades of grey that you can print will directly affect the print quality of the graphics that you print so if you look at some of the printouts that we have that has grey scaling i'm sure you agree with me that with this latest picturegrade enhancement technology we've got printouts that are far superior to what we have seen the next thing that we've done to increase the uhm print quality is really the superior toner technology what this does is to avoid the ghosting image problem i understand that ? ? that some of the printers competition printers out there today do have this problem in other words uh when you print a black uh when you print a page that has a lot of black on it and then you go on to the next page and you uh hold up the text page against the light you do see some of the ghosting effect left from the previous page using the superior toner technology lexmark is able to avoid this problem and i think uh if you compare printouts that has got a lot of patches of black with the uh lexmark printers this is superior machine to a lot of those that are out in the market to allow to increase the quality of your printout we give you fifty-two scalable fonts and we also give you the ability to adjust the stroke weight of this font having print quality is important but so is having a high having a machine that prints at a speed that you want we have uh move on from the motorola ? ? uh processes that we use in the forty twenty-nine to the risc processes risc processes as you would know is faster in calculate in rected?? calculations and that gives you a much faster printout especially when you have complicated uh graphic as mention earlier the printers the printers start from ten pages per minute goes all the way up to sixteen pages per minute in order to uh increase print speed we have what we call the advance memory management system 
Singapore	good afternoon everyone uhm you will have seen quite a few things on that video and if you noticed you know as you listen to to me and if you even look at the little advertising brochure there's a lot of focus about doing something worthwhile to your lives and you sort of look at it and you can go my god am i suppose to be a saint you know is this some sort of a profession where you have to have a little lobe to your head and you got to be into a calling uhm from one point of view you know that's often a way teaching is considered you sort of look at it and you sort of think that uhm from a very altruistic point of view you're taking care of other people and well i work with seventeen and eighteen year olds uhm which is not far away from your age i suppose and really it is that because you know when you first start out when i started out and in nie you don't really think that you're going to be doing much except imparting knowledge that you're going to tell someone about something else and that's that but you know once start you find to your horror really and you're not just doing that you become in the course of time a lot of other little surrogate things you become a surrogate you know you sort of get all the problems nobody wants to tell their par parents so they sort of bring it along to you or you get you know surrogate girlfriend or boyfriend as well they sort of use you as his prop they try out their lines before they go and attempt to engage with other people so you know it's a lot of things which focus your attention on other people so from that point of view where is it you know word  uses the catch phrase about doing something worthwhile with your life yes there is a relevance to it there is a meaning to it because you are forever working with other people and that's where i like to start with by telling you if you want to ask yourself why teach ask yourself this question do you like people can you stand noise would you like your life to be in a state of turmoil at times and would you like difference if your answers to this sort of things are yes then you're on your way to finding out what is there in the teaching profession now you know the sort of images you had there on the video screen about you know where you can do all sorts of little different things it's perfectly true yes i'm not denying the fact that no one will be a teacher and anyone who sat in a classroom can't deny the fact there's the boring mundane stuff to do there's the timetable that everybody follows and everybody hates there's marking that the teacher does look at at anyone of us straight in the eye and ask us whether we like the marking we'll look at you and say is the moon made up of blue cheese no we all made the stuff so we do it anyway but i can look at you and say from a counter perspective are you really thinking that anywhere in any job in any country that there is not going to be something which is routine routines are there it's part of life but i'm telling you that while the paper work routine might be there in the teaching profession there is one thing that will always change now if you're a banker your central consideration is not so much at least from my point of view it's not so much the person in front of you it's that sheet of figures in front of you it's that thing the figures and whether or not it's going to balance whether or not at the end of the day everything is going to come out in picture perfect on paper so you're working with people but only as a by-product not as a direct and in front of you let me take another example now let's say you were a doctor you could say that just as altruistic as being a teacher is it worthwhile staying away you can't look at anyone and deny it's not worthwhile but again you know people are there but you're more interested in their in their insides the bits that you want to cut out not living and they're not looking at them at least from my point of view i think you're looking more in them for things again they're there but they're a by-product because you're focussed on something else but when you're teaching there's no way you're going to avoid one thing there's is going to be a person in fact if you teach in a secondary school up to thirty-five of them you teach in a junior college fifteen to twenty-five they're going to be there they're going to be staring at you and they're be all looking at you wondering so what you you're going to do with us today but we don't want to do anything that's the hard realities of life and you'll never run away with the fact there is a person there and you would have to communicate with that person now that to me is the call of teaching because you're a people and no one person is the same as the next and that makes it so highly flexible so highly different now you will find out most of us especially those of us who teach english chatter on forever simply because we collect stories of students and it gets terribly boring because we have stories about who to go up to whom and who did where to what but that's our problem you see we are with people all the time and you know if you look around and ask some people why they stay in the profession when they're been in it for thirty forty years they'll tell you because of people and because the fact when you're with someone else you can't be selfish you got to forever look out look at other people and in looking at them i can tell you you learn something by yourself as well you'll learn to grow because from another point of view i could say this teaching is not just a noble profession the highly self-indulgent profession cause you could sit there now if you ever wanted to be power crazy this is your ideal chance you have people at your mercy and there are many new things that can be done and only things that limit you are your imagination so you know i can i can take a really humerous point of view and say that many teachers me included we're all probably self-indulgent you know that's the truth of it but from another point of view it's also self word  i beg your pardon it's in your self-interest because you are never going to be static as a teacher you just can't be there's no two situation which is the same yes the books for instance in my in my particular area the books i teach might be the same but no two people react to the same thing in the same manner so you know in that way it's different i can give you an example now in the college i work in we do what's call the fun-o-rama or a fun fair every two years it's great fun and we all say yes you know yes this year there won't be trouble we will have good fun uh but if we get every year there is a new set of people so one year we have a peaceful time everything gets set up and you sort of walk around you'll be like a middle manager you know the real professional type all you have to do is walk around and check and say oh it's going well isn't that nice that was fine and the next year went round screw up the gas canister real fire going so you see it's just of variety all the time and that kind of variety carries over into the way you teach someone now i would think what uhm what the speaker said on the video is very very accurate this is the one profession where your mind will continue to grow intellectually you can't just say well i was train as a heart i train in psychology or something else or history but now i work somewhere else doing something which is nothing to do with my degree god word i really like teaching it's always to be something directly relevant to a degree in front of you i bet that you're going to grow as well so from one point of view teaching's ideal for anybody doesn't want a quiet back word who wants that to have a little bit more of excitement but not the kind of excitement that revolves only around making money it you know i'm not saying that you can't get rich in teaching it's a stable job honest and you know the pay scales are good comparative to some place in in the private sector right can't deny but even if you found your own doe you don't keep up you do the other things because you gain in a personal way which you may not do if you just push paper now if you ask me which is the part i like the most about the teaching i would say the people i would meet i'm always meet the people and the fact that they keep coming back to you you know if they start out as your students especially when you were seventeen and eighteen and that age group they start as your students if you're lucky they become your friends and that's the best part of it so you think about it in this point of view would you really want to turn down a job where one you can grow intellectually two there's always difference three you're constantly meeting new people and making friends if these three things are going to be important as a matter of your life have this with the profession that should have your vision so please think about it  good evening again good afternoon rather still afternoon okay right let me first go through the course that you would be doing in nie dr chen has mentioned to you and has given you the core structure just to familiarise yourself with terminologies i like to go through the types of the course and the duration and what you need to have the basic requirements okay firstly you have the postgraduate diploma in education in secondary whenever the term secondary is mentioned it includes jc okay this course is for equips you to put all the skills pedagogical skills to teach in secondary jc levels okay the first programme which is academic only it's a nine-month okay and you enter into july and you finish off in the following march with your exams then you go to schools to teach okay and for this you need to have a degree from a university in at least two teaching subjects this is what miss charlotte beck has been telling you two teaching subjects is essential and you know in secondary schools most of the teachers would teach two okay in jc you may specialise in one subject okay and most of our jc teachers are people with honours degree so if you want just trying word to teach at jc and nothing you must have honours there are some without honours degree but that's the exception rather than the rule alright  now the next type of programme for secondary is pgde postgraduate diploma in education with pe specialisation okay some of you are very sports incline you're very sporty uhm some of the men are as well okay you can apply to teach too for this course to be trained in the pgde secondary with pe it's one year and nine months an extra year this is because at the moment in nus we do not have nus or ntu we do not have a degree in pe 
Singapore	well good afternoon to all of you i would appreciate if you all of you can come down a little bit so that we can look eye-to-eye we'll see double rather than having you looking down on me i'm going to making me feel small so quickly just move down a little bit besides i don't have the neck at all i have problem raising up head true can you please come down the fact that you're here this afternoon i think speaks very well upon you this is a beginning of a very exciting word  well for tertiary institute for tertiary learning am i right to say you're first year just by show of hand i would like to know how many of you are doing first year academic subjects like history geography english literature that kind how many okay but i'm speaking to also quite a number of people who are in social sciences who are doing things like economics sociology political science am i right okay so i know whom i'm talking to good yes as i've been introduced i am chen ai-yen geetha was in nie four years ago five years ago three well only three and you can see that she is still as young as ever one of the greatest delight of a teacher is to really see your student grow and bloom and she was like that but now there's even more poise do you think that she's very very confident yes she's really happening okay of course it has nothing to do with one fact she was one of my favourites alright that she was in my tutorial and i know her intimately well well but it's not that because she talked about the challenges and realities of teaching and one of the realities is that you really know people true you people she also talked about that teaching is very very different from other jobs very true sometimes beginning you are skeptical how do you know you know this from word the others are just imagination let me tell you my personal example okay i did not join teaching as uhm a first career when i graduated from at that time it's called the university of malaya and singapore long time ago i actually join the then radio and television singapore i was a news editor it was exciting jobs i was in parliament i was chasing facts i'll be all over the place you know and you write bold stories mine you at that time because there're very few people you do more things than people nowadays because now usually they're more specilisation and i was in the job for five years there were times when dan buttsworth you know with the oil rig names people will say you want to go vietnam you want to go uh sarawak you want to go here and there and i always drawback and i said i'm only a woman you know i think it'll be too dangerous to go out to the field in that those ways it is true life out there in journalism i now it's a very very uh popular subject nowadays very exciting it's true you talk to people it's true it's people orientated but not quite centred in no time in journalism really shapes the lives of people and no time is journalist really eight hours interacting with students well i may not have eight hours in fact time word i'm dead because we were in a tertiary hold you know i am i'm not with secondary school but in secondary school it's true when you have a school function sometimes you literally live with them i know of one jc teacher who happen to be single who actually live in the school during examination time just to be with the students and all the students no wonder did very well midnight he plays basketball somebody in vjc i think some of you may know who this is alright so this is what i call a mark of dedication doing so you are a model the person did not set himself out to be a model but sometimes you became a model who is much talked about and everybody remembers him so it's not just uh imparter of knowledge he's actually a moulder of dreams a moulder of lives and it's no wonder renuka said that perhaps the reason why you're here your teachers contributed towards that of course many of you would say it is me who has done a lot of study okay so now what have i got to do when i'm here not just to affirm whatever geetha has said she said that teaching is truly exciting is truly exciting is truly challenging it's not just that but also to tell you that when you come to teaching in other profession i'm not exactly sure they truly give you a professional degree but when you become a teacher you are trained professional don't believe you go into engineering course you into accountancy course which are courses of ntu that i know quite well by now you're are given all the subjects to learn you go through practical exactly how to behave like an engineer nobody told them how true you'll say engineering and accountancy is problem-solving and keeping records what else nothing else we can tell you we teacher in word can tell you what this profession involves and how does a train look and this is what you do we have specific goals at the end of our training we can be sure that you are knowledgeable you're competent and you're reflective you look at geetha she's only one of many excellent teachers by the time you go through just a one year programme you'll be knowledgeable in the ways of the child not perfect of course everyday is a journey towards learning you'll learn more about should you go into the pgde primary programme more about children their developments if you go into pgde secondary programme you would know how all about adolescents if you go into pgde physical education programme you will be more knowledgeable about the way not only people behave but the way the physical means and built so that you can stretch how your body can really go into uhm the the the maximum you become very competent communicators one of the greatest things of professionals is to be able to communicate well i'm quite likely sure that an engineer or an accountant or well medical doctors usually speak quite well some of the people really speak very well teachers in general get through because they have specialist speech training they speak well they certainly know what they're talking the only thing is how to stop them right there might be some true that we talk all the time we are reflective i think we think over what we have done you can never find another lecture of mine exactly the same even if it is said in the afternoon you can be sure because you know how to gear our teaching to the needs of your audience you noticed what i did the very time i must know my audience i must know who i'm talking to i know you're from arts and social science the first year i know what exactly what are the subjects you're taking because it helped me in the way i pitch my conversation so reflection is not just to be about lagu word  and in deep thought and when people talk to you you don't know answer i don't mean that i mean that you factually think through and think back on the things you do so that's one way that you can grow a mark of a growing professional so the goals of our teacher education programme are simply three very simple they get not that easily achievable but you do how do we make you do this so we have courses in educational studies professional courses we have courses in curriculum studies to make you teach in subject areas this is where i come into why did i ask you to raise your hands if you are have academic subjects here in nus you're entering into the excitement of the discipline in certain discipline alright if you have academic discipline like literature english you know even chinese or or some other subject which i subjects which you take well you become you is very easy for you to become pgde secondary teachers because your specialisation subjects and later on i think rebuka uh will tell you more about that but if you are not but if you have read word  economics social work or what it is psychology and that sort of thing well chance is that you will be doing the teacher course in primary school because you don't have content knowledge or such a depth as to be able to meet the challenge of the school we have not said that you would not be parting knowledge in terms of discipline right you will but this is not the one thing you do it is one of the many things you do but it is a very important thing so you must have content now that will help you i think those of you come here we'll like to complement you and you to select your courses wisely don't just say psychology is very important sociologists are also very important but actually i want to teach in secondary school well too bad because you do not have word  academic subject whereas if you are a graduate in any of those disciplines and you want to do pe the consideration is slightly different you will really like to be very robust and strong physique and good in your physical coordinations before you can be considered you know for that kind of degree so there must be something which is natural in you before we can nurture you as well word okay and so this is quite true you have to consider teaching curriculum studies how to teach those subjects by the time you come to us we won't be teaching you the content of geography or history or literature but we will teach you how to teach those subjects i hope you can you are with me clear? okay because that helps too in the shaping uhm selection of your subjects and the third part which is very important is the time you really gain practice in school and you will have the cooperation of teachers like geetha manee i'm sure she has been cooperating teachers to some younger teachers and pass on her skills you work with professionals in a very professional way including how to handle mundane routine things like timetable nobody likes it and yet you know how to smile you know and because well in every sphere of life there are certain things you don't like to do but you just have to do okay so timetable is one instance so this is what we promise you one year programme and we will give you a fully trained programme for those of you who are in chinese or uhm uhm general not japanese chinese or malay you will be recruited into the pgde special programme where you would be taking not just uhm uh the the these courses that i am telling you in addition to educational studies and going through the practical in your curricular area you will be specialising in the languages that you're specialising and your moral education so in brief this is the course that we offer to all the graduates of gdpe primary secondary and physical education three years time four years time i'm looking forward to welcome you to with open arms as fellow professionals  good evening ladies and gentlemen uhm on behalf of the national university of singapore society i welcome you to this talk this evening my name is zaibun siraj and i take charge of the study group sub-committee as many of you know the study group sub-committee organises all the talks and forums uhm on a variety of topics from political to economics to social et cetera  we value your inputs and if you have any advise and suggestions as to what kind of talks you want for the future do let me know or just drop a line at the receptionist and we will take note of it and we will try to address your needs and your interests 
Singapore	okay the learning point of this exercise is this first you must have be creative enough or be imaginative enough to locate where the pages are then you use your logic to work out the total answer the logic ha but you are not creative enough or you are not imaginative enough to locate where the pages are all your logic will go to nought will go to waste you think about that that's why sometime you go and see your boss your boss scold you aye you're not imaginative enough lah always give this sort of answer not imaginative imagination is very important as what einstein says imagination is more important than knowledge einstein was reading he was one day daydreaming riding on a beam of light shooting towards the distant star but to his great surprise he did not arrive at a distant star he arrived at our local front our front here say aye what what has what has happened so he used his logic to explain it should actually mark a curve instead of going straight in another words uh light is does not necessarily tra travel on a straight line it's curve the universe is curve so he kept word to accumulate when he look at the curve so how did he arrive firstly he used his imagination his creative word  thinking after then he use his logic to explain so coming back to coming back to our problem which is more important creative thinking or logic thinking creative thinking or logical creative thinking if you look at it you and i we all graduates as a graduate we're paid that extra premium to solve logical problem or creative problem creative problem logical problem the clerk can do no need you what for employ you if you don't you see logic problem is application of set principles set set rules lah i give you ten dollar you must give four dollar i mean it's all very standard stuff okay if you your your car cannot park here fine ten dollars just fine ten dollars straight away logical it's that logical applying set principles but you and i are paid premiums to do creative solving to do creative problem solving if my problem is very logical no need to employ you lah basic task you are you are employed for the job to think think creatively now what sort of problems are difficult to solve creative problems or logical problems creative problems why firstly because of greater degree of uncertainty number two you must create your own answer the answers are not off the shelf number three it takes longer time to solve because there is uh no set procedure so these are three reasons why creative problems are harder to solve than logical problem what's the difference between logic problem and creative problem logical problems you use logic you use what what you call convergent thinking you also uh yah and one answer alright and lastly uh uh and there are four also don't know what i'm talking about let me to check there are three only let me get it facts right sometimes i forget it alright okay basically uh right one use convergence one use logic one answer convergent thinking vertical thinking if you have to use imagination then answer divergent in other words okay can i leave so much so for practical problem let us go into uh uh creative principle ha eight major principles here's try word  the first thing in creative principle is uh testing assumptions testing assumptions you must always test assumptions in fact when you talk about creativity uh willing to stick till there i can hear all the right answer just listen is good enough alright okay okay uh let me tell you about about creativity in terms of uh in terms of something which is very practical i think when we talk about creativity actually we're talking about how can we shape our paradigm now paradigm subserves assumptions ways of doing things we all have paradigm why is it that we're not creative in large in part because we have certain mind type certain way of doing thing and this can be very dangerous paradigm set out to do on people's graphs word  or word word you it prevent us from seeing things and that's pooh pooh word status let me give you an example in 1968 the swiss control seventy per cent of the watch industry they got seventy per cent market share that's really markets of you know in 1978 they only control ten per cent market share that is 'kosong' almost 'kosong' this is what i call the shift in paradigm of course from seventy per cent to ten per cent what happens what has what has happen in 1968 one of the swiss engineer new word  chepard word invented the quartz watch when he invented the quartz he showed it to all the swiss designers but the swiss designer the swiss watch maker of of of his day have a good look at the quartz watch and they'll say this cannot be a watch this is no tread how can this ever be a watch if you have no main spring no gear no bearing how can it ever be a watch ai yah nothing one nah this one just ignore it so the poor engineer uh but they allow the poor engineer to exhibit his uh quartz watch in the international uh watch show seiko and texas instrument were there 1968 both took a good look at the quartz watch and the rest is all history the swiss have to sack fifty thousand of their sixty-five thousand workers in the watch-making industry that's catastrophe because switzerland is like singapore very small they got three point five million people and we got about about slightly more to be sack twenty thousand of the people sack within ten years that is uh that is certainty very hard to imagine but what has happen this is because the swiss watch-maker were caught in their own paradigm no main spring no gear no bearings how can this ever be a watch forget it this cannot be a watch and this prove catastrophic for them let me tell you another story of our time this is pertaining to the cd player you know the compact disc player actually it was uh sony that invented the cd player back in the seventies early seventies but after deferring for a couple of years they gave it up because they just put it on the shelf but it so happen that philips was also developing it but philips thought that sony got head start maybe we should just go and talk to sony they may tell a thing or two so uh philips brought their cd player along and philip show sony their cd player when when the sony people saw philips' cd player they nearly drop dead because philips produced the cd player of what we know of today the four and the half inch one is it very small one do you know why the sony people nearly drop dead all the while they were thinking of twelve-inch cd player you see ah when you invent a twelve-inch cd player see if i could word  firstly if you want to make it portable carry around okay besides being bulky or what let say you you manage to make it portable the thing is this lah a twelve-inch cd player can last eight hours of playing time now which battery can last eight hour you have problem number one problem number two you know how much a record player cost if it is twelve-inch that runs for eight hours one hour already cost you thirty buck eight hours my goodness almost three hundred buck who could afford a piece that cost three hundred buck so no wonder they put it on the shelf you see the sony people were caught in the paradigm of the of what of the twelve-inch record player and because when they got stuck they couldn't move at all they got stuck and they could not move at all once you get the danger of paradigm getting caught you know getting caught i'll like to talk about mcdonalds in singapore when robert kwan wanted to introduce the mcdonalds in singapore it was especially a paradigm shift too it was a relevant shift he see a lot obstacles the obstacle is firstly he's bringing in the concept of fast-food no need fast-food in singapore a hawker centre our hawker centre equally fast you sit down there for five minutes the fellow give you right how can i talk about fast food number two singaporeans don't eat beef right because many of us are buddhist right hamburger also got beef number three there was already a a fast-food centre here a & w and a & w therefore they were struggling right they were not doing business in fact i mean they were about to you know at the verge of  word  they were struggling but here again a paradigm shift robert kwan in mcdonalds prove them all wrong okay so it's very dangerous if we get stuck to a paradigm ha we need to to break away from this from this paradigm from this usual way of thinking from this concept i think however a little bit crazy ha okay first step paradigm breakage is that we must always try to test our assumptions testing assumptions is very critical let me tell you a story two boys went to a forest they met a bear the bear started to give chase of the two boys half-way through through the running uh the two boys one of the boys stopped he tried to take out from his back-pack his reebok running shoes and started to put it on the other boy turn around and you crazy fellow what for you put on your reebok running shoes you'll never run faster than a bear the other boy putting on his shoe turn around and say yes it is true i'll never run faster than a bear but i only have to run faster than you that's what i mean by testing assumptions anyway you can go wrong word  first assumption was of course run faster than a bear second assumption is to run faster than the boy than the bear will catch the boy won't catch you but that doesn't mean that you all should go back and uh don't have to work very hard just work better than your other colleagues okay the second thing that we need to do is uh in fact testing assumptions is uh we have to be pos we we have to adopt a positive attitude okay you have to try to obtain a you can get ready uh to okay uh i want you to give me as many comments as possible alright i give you uh two minutes to think about my new wheel barrow can see my wheel barrow ha can see my beautiful wheel barrow forget about the spelling a bit wrong don't worry i'm damn hopeless on spelling b a r r o w okay i can never get the spelling word  okay i'll write uh what uh give me as many comments you can think of i'll be going round to collect comment so everybody must come up with one ah okay we'll start with the other row and save this row from all embarrassment word  okay we'll start from the first row okay first comment any comment you can repeat what other people had said nevermind  comments  now look carefully if i were to look carefully at all your comments actually uh this is what you want i told you this a design of a new wheel barrow ha i did say this is new wheel barrow design okay doesn't matter lah okay lah i i okay lah i don't know what i say okay nevermind  ah alright okay if i were to look carefully at all your comments ah actually this is what you want right observe carefully am i not right this is what you want? correct or not? so what you want is a what? a conventional old wheel barrow what you want is a conventional old wheel barrow but when you see a new design of wheel barrow you 'ng kum guan' you must go back to the original 
Singapore	but in this part of the world we're still okay and uh and the emphasis is really is to say how do we look at the market place today and how can address those challenges that we have and uh when i look at you it makes me feel very young i mean it was uh seems like yesterday that i was still thinking of and uh the way that he gave me the the the introduction makes me feel very old eight years okay market management what i intend to is that i just go through a very uh brief outline of what market management is all about and uh if any point in time whereby you want to stop me and ask questions please do so right don't hesitate to that now since this is entrepreneurship society right i should talk about name?? of entrepreneurs now i just want to have this chart now you have a lot of uh hell a lot of definition on what's what an entrepreneur is and uh in my personal opinion this is nothing this is just my opinion alright i think there should be a balance between in-born traits and acquired knowledge right in-born traits are something like you cannot learn i mean it's in you whether you have a guts you dare to take risk are you a risk taker or are you a risk adverse are you innovative do you have a vision do you have a strong desire to succeed and whether you have business acumen this is something that is one side of the weighing scale but very often a lot of people talk about entrepreneur they talk about this side they forgot about this acquired knowledge not many of us are so lucky that the we can leave school you know if we don't feel studying right for we still have to acquire some knowledge and this knowledge is really to help the entrepreneur to make structured decision this is called structured business approach how you plans and control your how do you plan and control your company and that's very important part of entrepreneur how does a entrepreneur grow and once it grow how do you control it it it's better if you have some basic accounting and legal knowledge although if you have money to buy this profession and of course lastly it's management skills so you really need a combination of both to make you a good entrepreneur and uh what i intend to do today maybe i don't have this ought in maybe share a little bit some of the uh methods or some of the scientific way of managing a market and uh hopefully those who have this will in complement with your knowledge these are the only two colour charts i have okay the rest is black and white i just want to give a brief intoduc introduction of what is market management and how's how is it relevant to entrepreneurship i want to introduce the term call meas market measures cookbook this is actually the term we use in ibm on how we look at the market place and uh we do a lot im portfolio analysis and uh this is not new those who study financial management right is nothing to do with shares but if you manage a market it's actually a portfolio and of course how do you integrate of what you have and how you implement in the market place and i'll conclude you got any questions so far in my seminars the first few charts always no problems because they cannot cannot fault my agenda right now the content now what is market management really now we define it as analysis planning implementation and measurement of programme design to determine the needs and wants of both new and existing target markets now you have this this term on customer satisfaction right customer needs and wants so the whole idea of market management is really for you understand who are your target customer they are the one who buy your good and services i mean without the customer you won't get your salary without your customer you won't come?? you won't get your income from company right so who what does a customer wants in the market and new and existing target markets you have to target i mean we learn a long way in ibm alright in the past when we first started we are everywhere i mean every high end to the low very low end we are we've maintain presence everywhere but right now we ask ourselves right can we afford it do we have the skills maybe we are not all things to all people maybe we should able to segment the market those that we are strong we shall have a strong segment those who are weak and we think it's emerging we should do something about it so this is whole of concept of market management now the design customer satisfaction it's only the customer that is satisfied with you then he'll keep on doing business with you if your customer is not happy they will not come back the second time so in whatever business that you do your focus is only the customer and of course the purpose is to achieve organisation objectives is very simple profit revenue market share which is very dear to every organisation i sleep with it eat with it and do everything else with it right this this diagram just show that you have the voice of the customer you listen to your customer what your customer wants alright you plan you you define your solution how can i meet the customer need the customer has a problem the customer has a need how can i meet that needs how do i be a solution that against that need and how do i deliver it what channels do i deliver it and how do i measure that whether i'm i succeed or i fail so in every step in organisation these are the key elements that to determine whether you are doing a good job in managing the market now you have blow this up to actually look at a model now what are customer needs and wants is really how do you how do you go about understanding customer needs and wants alright it's called opportunity assessment how do you assess opportunity i mean although i present all these steps to a big company like ibm is easy because we have i used to manage a big department of a twenty over people doing nothing but just planning i mean they're just dreamers everyday come to office sit down there and just dream of things look at market place right but if you're entrepreneur you're one man show how do you go about doing it it's a degree of how much you do but still you have to do you must know what's the opportunity in the market place right and then you say these are the opportunities and ask myself where should i select my market should i go after a pc market or should i go to a higher edge or should i go to software or should i go to solution even software should i go to the emerging new technology or should i just write a pc programme and put do games for kids so these are selection of segment when once you selected how do you strategize in this segment how do you go about gaining share how do you about winning opportunities and then you do a segment study segment study simply say where you are today do you have the strength do you have the uh ability to meet the challenges in the market place if you don't have those strengths how how you go about doing should you go into maybe a partnership acquire some other companies to help you to do it or source solutions right then you do a you develop a segment plan now these are these are really a very detail steps in planning which i don't intend to go into details of it in fact when i i've been going round the countries to preach these and it always takes about three days course and i'm only given one hour right so i just want to skim through all these term but if you have any question please let me know now once you define the customer needs and want if this a internal we call commitment managements internal planning process how do you go about sourcings and development these are internal organisation plan right how do you have plan development or how do you offer the solutions and how do you gonna start it and i think last week you or the week after next you'll learn some something about funding alright and how do you price your products pricing is a very important element as entrepreneur not everything is priced low i mean we'll learn it a hard way in in the computer industry i think when we you talk about ibm what's what's the first impression you have very expensive right very expensive but is it price is is it a main is the main is pricing the main reason why that we lose share if i lower the price more will i gain back all the shares is a very interesting toil on price then you you have to really know how you deliver your solution right what is your customer relationship now in all business you and your customers is very important especially on relationship why should your customer buy from you are similar guys selling the same products sometimes it's the face that matters alright and uh it's important your relationship with your customer and the services you provide why should we stress so much on services like singapore airlines for example why when they first started how do they say this airline what's the airline what's the difference how do i differentiate mine product from the other airline company in services the in-flight service the singapore girl alright sarong kebaya so these are you know all the all the differentiation strategies that sia has adopted and because services is where the customer see and of course you must have a continuous measurement feedback and very often the entrepreneur you see a lot small companies right it's nothing good for them to to say how well they are doing they do by gut feel they look at things that're happening but really you need have a structured measurement process where you ask yourself where you are today what you want to achieve and at the end of the day what is the bottom line that you're looking for alright so far any question how do you go about doing a selection process in the market place alright now you have there are three elements that you have to take note one is the size of the market you have to know how big is the market place what is the structure of the market is it a very clustered or is it very disperse is it attractive to go in if maybe in the industry the pc industry for example every guy is losing money you you come across a very good design do you want to go in what kind of activities that settle in the industry you have to do a lot a bit of sales analysis is it of is there a lot of opportunity? who are the customers and keenly who are your competitors because you are the small guys right who are the big guys in the market place because if there are big guys in the market you need a lot of uh your strength will be different you need a lot of capital right how do you how do you go into the market from there and what product exist in the market  you have to select in your prioritise 
Singapore	i i hope to be able to to address your question i think which you know is gonna be more interesting and let's have a more interactive sort of a a discussion session uh as you can tell you know from you know from the brief introduction of my experience uh i have worked in many many different areas in terms of you know uhm functional areas but in terms of the group of customers you know that i deal with you know i find that the the smp you know or the entrepreneurs you know some of them are at least is indeed the most uh exciting and rewarding from my point of view it has also been the most frustrating you know because to deal with these people that have got enough egos that sort of you know roll all over you if they're successful can be quite a bit of a challenge just uh so i would be than happy to share with you some of my experiences just before i start off you know reading so called from my my text uh i work with a number of different people uh including people that have form a company that is for example uh s tech you might have heard of it which is a compatible to to creative technology that is a lot of my clients uh kent hurst you know the direct marketing people has another client of mine you know i have got another client that is an inventor you know that took the simple cable and decided to do something different with it you know uh and the list goes on i work with a number of different people that got some you know marvelous ideas looking at convention businesses and you know having a fresh look at how they would package things uhm so very exciting and i'm you know hopefully you know uh all that i see in front of me everyone of you are people have the spirit in you that one day and you gonna go out there and do do your thing but ladies and gentlemen to start with you recall businessman robert ng's remarks you know on the virtues on greed i'm sure at the recent pre-univeristy seminar that has sparked off much discussion and debates you know and letters in the press now i do not intend to be as provocative this evening being maybe being an accountant you know basically you know i got to be a little bit more conservative i'm here only you know to give you some ideas so you can then challenge you know amongst yourself and with me some of these ideas indeed you know this topic of entrepreneurship and what is it has generated much discussion you know in terms of you know definition not just in singapore but all over the world it has what i hope to achieve today in fact is to leave behind some ideas of what entrepreneurship is all about and who the real entrepreneurs are as you would see later on during the rest of my speech you know this concept of entrepreneurship also changes with the times you know and it will change as to how we are perceive you know entrepreneurship ten years from today will be different from what we do to uh ten years twenty years thirty years down the road now in the course of my presentation i'll be drawing from examples of real life entrepreneurs to help illustrate my point some of these people are people i know personally some are clients whom we have serve while others are personalities such as sim wong hu of creative technology michael dell of dell computers frederick smith the founder of federal express  good argument i had an argument with you know some of my staff in the office about this concept the looking at mcdonalds in singapore their introduction of the kiasu burger now is that entrepreneurship some would argue yes it's entrepreneurship because you seeing a a unique taste there you know some of the marketing programmes is it entrepreneurship yes creating demand you know it's you know in spite of using in a or fix franchise you adapt to the local market and change it and you grow additional business that is entrepreneurship as well  so i mean you can that if if you are a little adverse or if you are lacking in in in in in in for example capital to take forward an idea you can you know find you know a a company that is you know as enlightened as three m you know and be able to pursue you know even entrepreneurship within you know an organisation but certainly that's very enlightening some of these stories are very interesting uh federal express for example the way they first started they became very very successful now with it went off you know faxes voice-mail what is gonna be the next lap for them what's gonna happen to this company i'm watching i don't know what will happen to them let's see what will happen to them some of these story so nothing is forever you gotta keep changing all the time and this is what entrepreneurship is all about you know the ones with the continue sea of potential customer demand goes up there and satisfies that demand as an idea and be able to convert that idea into reality now a lot people have ideas now is that entrepreneurship just ideas how you know i've seen so many people with just ideas but some people just never convert their dream as they will forever be dreamers i've got some very bright friends mine very clever people mind you and you know every a year or so in fact about two years once they sur resurface and and i'll ask them what happen to your that last idea you know and i know you know nothing has happen and they were good ideas because you know he what's lacking is you remember the definition of entrepreneur you need the managerial capability to see through as you are just as important it's not just ideas but do you ever see through as important just as important any other questions okay i'm going to be very provocative here the people going ten years from now twenty years from now looking at two two sets you know two possibilities if i have a child that has to be in the job market twenty years from now in singapore want of the good life want a comfortable life rewarding life if you're not sure whether you're going to succeed my answer to the question be a technician be a good electrician be a good plumber be a good car mechanic you'll be in good demand isn't it don't be a graduate forget it if you're gonna be mediocre graduate forget it either that or be prepared to work overseas not in singapore so the time will come when you know must word  agree with your proposition now you want to go through the list of some these people who uh the singaporeans that at least that i know of here you note the strange thing is that the outcast in the sense you know that has succeed you know a lot of these people that have succeed they are outcast damn out and outcast i can tell you that some of these people our society have you know prejudice you know against them why because a lot of them were chinese educated they're good technicians but they went to technical school they cannot speak properly they cannot won't and can't get pass an interview you want to go and get a job with ibm they won't go pass the screening test because they can't speak proper english so they are force into the situation so they become very good technician a lot of the entrepreneurs i meet now are people like that with their technical education chinese educated they are force by circumstances to go out there they are clever people they can see it they can't express it in the lingua franca in the business environment here so they are force to go out there and make it by doing it themselves they cannot do it with anybody under the establish standards they will never make it so that's one group of them very interesting group they're a group look at these people he is only a you know technical educated he is not a full-fledge engineer to my knowledge anybody knows he's an engineer i don't think he's an engineer alfred is not you know he's very you know very impressive when he stands up to speak he'll be a salesman not i got another client the direct marketing company 'o' levels definitely not a graduate he is a doctor wong kai is so you're right by and large they are the people that are you know not graduate they're also you know force by circumstances you know to have to strike it out on their own now that's one side of looking the other side of course is you know i mean you know once you know we we we i chatted with you know this child you know in the office just now and then we i have this discussion with you know some of you know the people in my office you know the younger generation so to speak and we sort of talk about quality of life and what what you want to do in life you know and you know they came up with a very interesting proposition says well the best career you know comfortable life in singapore if you are graduate recent graduate join the army in seven years or so you'll be a major you could be very well paid there are no wars in this region you're being well-looked after it's so comfortable why should i take a risk i mean that's kind of sad you know isn't it but this is you know this are my you know we hire pretty good people in my organisation and these are the people that tell me this there some of these discussion goes on amongst you know fellow graduates so any the enlistment officer is just next door for you to sign on and say potential majors so i think you know things will change but i think it's changing because of the environment changing you know more graduates you know would have to take the risk you know because there aren't enough opportunities in singapore your bit word will grow but i think we're growing more brighter people with greater expectations you know with you know higher educational levels then you know there are jobs for offer what's the government trying to say now civil service head count they're holding head counts right if they're holding head counts they will tell you operation base is going to increase so the civil service will continue to take in the bright but only the very very brightest will get in head counts are not going to increase significantly private sector domestic business in singapore how far more can we go we're already maturing four we'll have to settle down to about four to five per cent growth and we would be very lucky over the next maybe you know twenty years or so where does it present all these bright young people that are coming onto the market place you got to be entrepreneurial or be prepared to work elsewhere so circumstances will change ice-sin:s2a-042#> disagree with me please  comment and question  i've given you my views let's have some other views here i mean i will be more than happy to to encourage you all  comment  good point a very good point i mean you know i'm just to relay you know one of my partners spoke at the you know the last you know gathering here  steven phang came by and after his speech apparently some of this you know students approach him and one student came by with exactly the same problem you know where do you slot you know an idea into and this student said that i want to bring in bungee jumping you know i don't know who to approach 
Singapore	they are all r and d people they take the plunge and they make it the world is fuming word around r and d people there's no kidding right and uh this man from uh i think he's uh the chairman of a matsushita or something like that he says that the creation of product leads to the creation of wealth so as far as these people you are one of a pillars of success there are three pillars products marketing and finance so you have no money you have no market institute go for r and d right that's how i got started okay i i'm going to scrap through uh you know we might as well tell you how i got started in r and d it's just like telling a story you know but uh maybe i just briefly run through it and uh and uh see whether the you know you will get inspired first of all i believe i am a inquisitive person very curious i refuse to accept what someone tells me until i try out myself okay and i think that is one quality i believe in a r and d person if you were to accept anything somebody tells you then i think you are a forward not a innovative not a leader in order to be number one you have to lead you have to come with ideas you can't just accept okay so back in school i remember one uh one project that i i did how to how to build a a high voltage converter i know nothing about electronics okay so i had a little magazine that says how you can you can solve or generate a high voltage and uh it was like uh using a nail and you will have a front-wire and with your next word break switch in a battery on outside you have secondary coil so in same place you will connect all this together and put the switch on and off you will generate a high voltage actually it works but to implement that was difficult so how will you go about implementing such a a a idea into a pro a local product so what i did was i took a bell you know electric bell take out external wire and wire another coil on the other side it generates a high voltage a couple of hundred volts and i what i did was i took a bolt and put that into a into the hollow output put a metallic meta uh foil on it connect the two wires to it i had a lot of playboy magazines uh photograph on top stick it on and plug the bolt in my friends so when they open the bolt they got a very shock of their life so this is some things that i uh did and there's word  r and d the interest in uh wanting to create product okay so apparently there's a when i rave on r and d was my my lecturer in the universities got me a job in the summer vacation help him to build up uh certain uh you products that he was doing i got stuck was interesting you know uh i couldn't sleep i was trying to to you know figure out one day or come back to work on mondays you are crazy you know so if you want to do r and d do you have this in you this is not it's not a nine-to-five job it's nine to three a m sometimes okay so don't tell me i have to go home to have dinner with my mummy or with my girlfriends or boyfriends forget it and if for three years if you want to be really good forget about all these social dates just look at mister sim mister sim of creative technology he's still a i'm sorry i but i guess so he's got no time from girlfriends but he's such he's on the extreme side okay he's very wealthy so you don't have to be so wealthy you still can have girlfriends and boyfriends you know so if you were to ask me why i go into r and d i'll give you two answers fore thing first of all i will say because of interest of an ideal of a dream you know that like you fresh out of university i think i know everything you know and go in blow a lot of chips you know come as a you know you expect the the wires to be zero resistance it's not you know you think that you can run a a higher crazy uh stuff on the long wires you you fail miserably word you know so there are two answers now i'll say after fourteen years of doing r and d i would go to r and d because it give you the opportunity to be your own boss with that knowledge in you you see i will tell if you leave during this university now or junior colleges now you go out to work two years later everything is gone you'll only retain between three to five per cent of what you're taught you'll only remember we word is to i  word tower word i word  saw word  everything else what accounts extrapolation all secondary all given back to your lecturer you don't need that anymore it's all gut feel you touch the a board you suppose to know where the the the the board is like a doctor you know let's say i think you've got a slight fever you know something like that okay this is all gut feel okay after a while experience comes in you look at the board you're word is on the line you have ground problems the textbook never teach you it's all hard work someone one says successful product of man is ninety-nine per cent perspiration one per cent inspiration okay so you finish nine per cent very fast the ten per cent take you ninety per cent all the time so the reason why i would like to see more of you guys go into r and d is because it gives you the opportunity uh to first go into any area you want right from r and d you can go into marketing you make a super marketing man why because you know how to use a soak word better than anybody else if you have not done r and d first you go into sales you try to use a soak in front of a customer you can't even trigger it you think how your customer feels right it's that's a fact so you think that unless you go into say sales three years' later become a manager by the time you have given back everything to your lecturer you are just like any other person can be a a accounts student or business student vying for the same job where is your competitive edge you have no compete you have no advantage the only way to stay a to stay ahead is to have that niche a competitive edge that's a fact right if everybody were to say so you want two thousand dollars give him one two thousand dollars how can i provide one thousand dollars so if do r and d you specialise three years later your foundation is laid you can go to sales if you are still good carry on r and d after five years you've got a lot products hiding in your mind go and see a banker or investor and say i'll like to start a company with you and for my share what i do you put ninety per per cent of the money you give ten per cent of the share free i still get my salary and that's it that's how you get started without any money no that's a fact you ask mister sim how he get started his father runs a grocery shop alright not many of us have rich fathers alright so let's say you don't go into r and d that's why i have to go away from my my my my regret uh i guess it's fine now let's say you don't go into r and d okay you spend three years you become five years you'll become a manager by the time you reach thirty your lifestyle goes up hit thirty-five director of company appointed the the g m or director of company by the time you reach forty you're a heavy weight earning twelve thousand fifteen thousand a month what have you got nothing basically all you have is your p r when recession comes who do you think the boss will sack first not if you remember nineteen eight-five eighty-six when recession comes right i believe many there are many of you who have parents who may have lost the job you will realise that that's all why don't you have the word word  don't word word  forget about being kiasu go for the try what's what's the problem your five three to five years you fail go and get a job what's wrong but what you've learnt in r and d is yours nobody will take it from you it's your asset that's what you need after all you know in my my father gave me my education and i somehow i landed in singapore because of girl and uh later on i ended up a malaysian boy in singapore went into r and d fumble around here and there and uh with all this knowledge i met a investor so i told him an an idea basically how we got started was this i was running an engineering firm repairing ibm p c's uh ao general data general mainframes and uh that sort so we're having problems trying to repair all this computers what we buy in the market is scopes a uh something called huntrump  word tractor that's a v i trace you know and we have hundreds of boards every month and we got to send the board to the us and that time a pcxt causes one thousand five hundred bucks per board and you got to pay forty per cent to send it back to the us and it takes you three months to get it back where in singapore i got to replace the customer immediately so how do you run a company like this and there's no products in the market that can help us to do that so with that kind of problem i got my chief engineer to go out and start the company making test equipment that will solve this type of problem so we got an investor to back us up and we started with a ten square feet room three person that other person employed engineer left us after one month because he felt that we have no prospect so left two of us so everything was handmade we called it rolls royce alright everything was hand hand-wired handmade i still have all this in my office you know i can show you very proudly all hand-wired but we did have a product we got to the product was called supercat super because it was super product cat because it was uh computer-aided tested so we sold that we sold the product and uh the company running for a million dollars to an australian office we made some money and not a lot and because we we didn't have the capital so the ninety per cent belongs to the investor so we started another company and this time we were at thinking of a new product what could come out after supercat you see at that you we had no focus you say what is life after supercat after producing the product you know like your lexus what is life after lexus  you know you know that kind of feel 
Singapore	good afternoon uh ladies and gentlemen my name uh is ding hock hui i'm a senior quantity surveyor from the quantative surveying uh office in p w d so i'll be talking on uh quantity surveying services if you join uh p w d uh as quantity surveyors what you will do in p w d i think most of us are familiar with this uh organisation chart typical projecting uh where you have the client the architect contractor sub-contractors as well as a range of uh consultants that uh involve in the job appointed by the client to get a project going so the quantity surveyor as you can see is one of the project uh consultants involve in the job uh assisting the architect and you may have other allied professionals like structural civil engineers uhm mechanical and electrical engineers as well as uh other specialist consultants could have for interior design consultant  word consultant who are involve in the job this is the project team who will handle the project right from the outset the project team objective basically as far as i can see uh centred around uh three areas time control cost control and quality control you try to get the project completed on time within a specified uh programme within uh certain budgeted cost as well as to certain uh quality standard and what is the quantity surveyor's role basically is to safeguard uh government financial interest to make sure that uh money are well spent for the project and also to ensure that the public construction contract are procured in compliance with certain regulations uh which uh the main in purpose of this regulation is to ensure that the projects are procured lah with uh in accordance with uh certain rules so that they are transparent nobody can fault them and uh complain can be uh answered easily what then are the q s functions if you're employed as a quantity surveyor in p w d these are the basic functions that uh you probably be performing you'll be making uh cost estimates plans or cost plans for a project you work the estimated cost for budgeting purposes once uh the estimates are approved the money is allocated you proceed to call tenders that means you prepare your tender documents you will uh proceed to call tenders after the documents have been prepared lah in certain cases for large projects you'll have this p q we call it prequalification exercises that means uh contractors will be pre-qualified tenders we will narrow down contractors to those who are qualified to be invited to tender after tenders are called we have this tender evaluation recommendation of the tender to the client and uh after the tenders have been approved it is awarded to the successful contractor and uh fol following then we have contract documentation uh we document a contract that will be the basis to to base uh to to work out the contractual arrangement between a contractor and p w d and uh after the award of the contract we have contract administration that means uh we will uh make uh interim payment valuation to the contractors whether it's on monthly basis or on a stage payment basis we also work out the variations that are ordered uh during the cost of the work for the purpose of uh cost control we want to make sure that the the project budget or the contract sum is not exceeded we also finalise the account after a contract is completed uh at the end of the project after word word  certified and of course but not the least you see in every contract invariably there will be uh some contractual dispute maybe uh certain specifications or certain contractual provisions are not uh adequately drafted and there will be uh such contract dispute arising and uh as the quantity surveyor for the job uh it is our duty to advice the architects the engineers you see what is the view you see on uh certain aspect regarding the contractor's claims there right in addition to those basic q s functions some other q s functions that we do for example just now you have seen on the side uh this cost information quarterly is a publication of cost information uh which uh we uh make every quarter and which is available for sale to the public in this publication you'll be able to find information like uh cost indices of uh tenders or building materials or labour cost so that the the general industry the construction industry can refer to it and use it as a reference guide you see to let them have a feel of uh the trend of prices whether tender prices are going up or going down or whether material prices are going up or down that's uh cost information quarterly is available for sale to the public and it is published every quarter okay the next thing we do we also provide uh insurance and compensation valuation for the commissioner of land uh this is for the purpose of uh the land acquisition act you know there is in singapore we have this uh land acquisition act if property is uh acquired by the government compensation is payable to the land owner at certain pre-determined prices at certain age whether it's nineteen seventy-three nineteen eighty-six we will be able to be we are able to provide uh advice to the commissioner of land who's the one acquiring the property what is the value of that property at certain point in time whether it's nineteen seventy-three or eighty-six or even at current market value for insurance uh valuation it is for the purpose of uh insuring a property uh for fire uh for against damage by fire so this is required before any property is let out to the public we'll also provide advice on capital grant projects that means uh this capital grant projects are basically uh ministry of education uh projects aided-school projects where the government provides ninety per cent of the funds to this uh aided mission uh since the money the bulk of the money comes from the government in building the aided uh schools the mission schools we definitely will have to have a say to help uh ministry of education uh how to run these projects what sort of policies to follow and we have a team of uh people to sit in these committees to advice the aided school mission uh how projects are to be uh administered the types of projects that you'll be involved in as a quantity surveyor in p w d you have seen uh some of the slide just now these are some of the projects that uh i summarise here civil for civil engineering projects you have uh projects like road expressways flyovers interchanges underpasses tunnels word  bridges walkways and uh account for building projects uh you've seen a wide range of them on the slides building projects uh we have schools junior colleges prisons e r c drug-rehabilitation centres airport abdominal word tree offices polyclinics office-buildings singapore art-centre that's coming up uh very soon libraries and other institu ah institutional facilities like immigration centres police uh headquarters or police post apart from uh the projects that uh you'll be applying expertise what you're trained you also we also uh to your training and development needs if you join the service as a quantity surveyor uh opportunities will be given to you to be trained in uh your basic q s functions uh all those that uh i've uh spoken just now as well as uh matters relating to contract law arbitration just one area that uh further development training and development will be given to you as well as uh in computers uh we have actually an in in-house uh quantity surveying system uh that helps you to carry out your duties more effectively using computers uh these are on technical uh issues but on management we'll also send our staff for supervisory management as well as uh organisation and methods you'll be given uh you'll be given opportunities to attend uh training in these areas the forms of training you could be attending seminars conferences symposium symposiums are basically uh a forum where uh the experts will put up some papers and they will deliver it at that symposium and you will have the opportunity to participate in those uh discussions and forums of course uh there's more hands-on uh opportunities in the form of workshop practical attachments you could be given opportunities to be attached to a foreign firm in another country uh for some specific purpose to learn a certain uh area of work practical attachments sometimes you'll also have the opportunity to have study visits like uh for singapore art centre teams of uh professionals of p w d were given opportunity to visit uh various uh art centres in other countries like uh in the u k europe as well as america even for the development of the airport terminal two uh opportunities were also given to those staff who were involved in the airport development to visit various airports around the world before we actually uh do our own uh design so you'll be given opportunity to have practical attachments study visits and of course last but not least uh you have this structured learning programme where you can go for your masters courses m b as and uh if possible also your p h d okay that more or less concludes my section on quantity surveying hi i'm lim hock chuan from the public service commission uhm before i start it's good to see you smiling before i start can i just have a quick show of hand how many of you are from the architecture school okay so the bulk of them is for q s jobs uh okay uh after listening to my from uhm p w d i'm sure by now you have a good idea of uh the kind of jobs that are available for you as architects as quantity surveyors uhm whether you're involve in uh the design or the cost control of say schools or airport or hospitals or bridges whether your work entails uh uh design or retrofitting or conservation or renovation whether it's a procurement of contracts or contract administration there is a exciting uh career for you in the p w d either as a architect or as a quantity surveyor that will meet your aspirations and qualifications so these are very good professional reasons why you should join at the p w d but for the next five minutes or so you i just want to touch on some uh more down to earth reason close to heart reasons why you should join us now what sort of uh salaries would you are we talking about if you join us uh as a quantity surveyor okay the present starting salary for a quantity surveyor is a thousand eight hundred and eighty for uh ladies and guys who have not done national service and for those who have done national service uh presently the salary is two thousand hundred and forty dollars uhm this is the present salary i uh sure that you've heard the announcement made by the prime minister about a month so ago that the civil service salary will be review at the end of the year and we look forward to a revision upwards at the end of the year and so we could be talking about salaries that are that are a bit higher than these in terms of starting salaries okay now what about promotional prospects okay you join us as a quantity surveyor at uh thousand eight two thousand one and upon first promotion we are talking about a salary at least of three thousand three hundred and twenty-five uh upon first promotion okay and of course you go up the second promotion it starts from four thousand to about five thousand and all the way to uh of the top post which is about fourteen thousand dollars but like i used to tell the other group there's only one top post okay uh so if you don't make it to the top so maybe you're stuck somewhere in the middle i would say about eight thousand dollars well that's that's not too bad okay so this is for the uh quantity surveyors how about architects for the four or five of you who are with us? because your course is longer uhm you start at a higher salary uhm for those without n s you start at two thousand and ten and those with n s two thousand two hundred and sixty-five dollars okay this is your starting salary 
Singapore	thank you for coming down uhm today for taking your time off uh i'd like to actually just start off this talk uh by giving you a little bit of introduction of our company uhm you may heard of unilever but not of many them as a matter of fact would have actually about our organisation unilever but i'm pretty sure that all of you would have heard about the products that we market and the kind of businesses that we handle in singapore uh if i told you that uhm we are the people who actually manufacture and market products like lipton walls ponds elizabeth arden and uh something like another three hundred and seventy more products you'll be surprised in fact uh unilever is listed in fortune five hundred as the twentieth largest company in the world we are we were listed as the most profitable consumer products company in the world by fortune five hundred and uh that really makes us to a very large corporation now just to give you a little bit of background about unilever unilever is actually a huge multi-national that is anglo-dutch fifty per cent owned by london fifty per cent owned by rotterdam uh in singapore basically we are a marketing uh operation but we do have a lipton tea fac uh tea factory in singapore uh that's one of the reasons why we have also invited uhm some people from mechanical engineering will be able to ? ? answers of the day in fact uh we have been labelled as the tea excellence setter from this region and you you may be surprised that we are actually supplying chinese tea to china okay it's a fact and we we have been labelled as the most efficient production facility in the world by a by an international uh tea-tasting consulting firm and uh that leaves singapore's uh facility a very small but very effective operating unit we produce something like about three million tea bags a day and uh we amongst our suppliers as i mentioned includes china taiwan south korea japan chile malaysia indonesia so on and so forth now in singapore we are a we are a set up that that is about uh two hundred employees strong uh we about evenly distributed into well fifty per cent into manufacturing and fifty per cent into administrative services uh our operations are basically to as i mentioned market about uh the three hundred odd products that we actually manufacture and uh what we what we are basically a marketing driven firm which is supported by a sales function as well as personnel and commercial function now you may have uh you may have heard about our competitive competitors uh which uh sometime feature more prominently than ourselves namely procter and gamble and uh johnson and johnson and so on and so forth main thing is because they do use their company names behind them in marketing their products but unilever is a completely different set up because we have got operations not only in consumer products division but also in chemicals specialty chemicals uh patients?? and uh several other uh several other i should say business ventures we we we even have finance companies as well as uhm as well as uh bank a little bit of a little of finance as well as banking operations world wide where we have gone into joint ventures and we have even moved into uh information technology so actually unilever is one company which can offer all of you graduates who'd be coming out next year a pretty good career opportunity as well as placement the reason is because of as far as unilever is concerned we've got one of the best human resource policies uh where we actually plan for people's career advancement three year in advance then we we know exactly how many people we are recruiting over the next three years how our organisational structure will change over the next three years taking into consideration of the uhm market considerations and we've also know exactly who would be moving up when what sort of training opportunities we'll be having for each and every employee of ours now just to go into a little bit about training we are we are proud to say that we are one of the fore forerunners in terms of training in singapore we also expend something like six per cent of our payroll in fact that was that is the latest figure i just i have just fresh out of the budget meeting we have managed to spend something like about six per cent of our payroll on training on employees in singapore our training is basically unilever specific the reason is because we have got very structured international training programmes where what we do is that when we hire you recruits into our especially management trainees we we we call you new hires as management trainees when we hire management trainees into our company what we do is that we put them on the job training for about a year and right after that we do identity a main core group of management trainees who we will be willing to invest upon and what would happen is that you would be setting up a business principles' course for that particular group of people uh which exposes them to all of unilever functions now this is a regional course it's usually held around this region uh where it is rotated of course after attending this particular business principles' course and we would we would we would evaluate each and every management trainee right after this particular business principles' course which is very very uh vigorous i must say it's a tough two-week programme and once we give uh once we complete it you'll be out for evaluation now if you do well in that particular business principles' course then we would then go on to arrange for a swop programme for you where you would be spending six months of your working career in another country what we do is that we exchange you for someone else either from the function or from a different from another country like for instance if we swop you say with thai thailand then a person from thailand which could be coming down to singapore take away position and every for six months basically you'd be on your own you'd be given a budget to manage and uh you'd be in a completely immersed into a completely different uh environment as well as a country now you may feel a little bit apprehensive about it but uh actually this programme is to get people more mature in their working life and experience it's to train people to actually independently handle problems and uhm get your yourself immerse into the business into a different kind of environment that's the main objective behind this programme after which we would chart a specific course of career path for you and depending on it you you would be attending at least one regional or professional training training programme every two years you can see that unilever is one company which actually invests hell of a lot on their employees well as they say nothing is for free right why do we invest so much on our people it's because we demand results from the people whom we hire also it's because we believe a person cannot be adding on value through the company without the relevant train training via exposure in fact that's one of the reasons why a few years back unilever set up its own universities we call it the four acres where we we send our top most and the best employees to be trained in london in boston or in south america we've got three universities all over the world it shows the kind of commitment that we have in our people now i'd be uh screening?? you a little bit uh uh uh uh corporate video that uh we actually have involves the people talking about the uhm company's practice the kind of exposure that they have the kind of uh training that they receive and the kind of career development that we have offered to our uh employees shortly okay but before that i would like to also emphasize that when you work with unilever you'd have to be internationally mobile not just in the short-term but in the long-term the reason is because we do believe in exposing people all the around not only this region but also the world we have got several regional coordination office always which is pretty hungry for people we're also looking for a lot of people to be placed in china there's definitely?? whole exciting market and that's where we're sending most of our people to in fact last year we sent three of our top managers over to china and this year we'd be sending uh one person over to mexico and we'll to evaluate a few more people to be expatriated to some other countries okay so we do offer people places overseas but that is provided that each employee proves himself to be worthy of that sort of investment and exposure now you may have asked me uh the kinds of career opportunities that are available within unilever as of now now as of now as of today i'm not looking for any person but i am i would definitely be looking for people when at the at or about the time when you graduate that would be sometime in february or march as i said we do have a regular programme of expatriating our employees and when when we expatriate employees we would have opportunities for local graduates to actually fill up those positions and that's when when we would like you to apply to unilever and the selection criteria is pretty tough uh i would like i i i would not go into the selection criteria nor the process in which we actually recruit people because it's uh relatively confidential but we do have a structured way of recruiting people but the kind of people whom we are looking for is number one the person has to have has to be street smart okay ultimately i was just telling a colleague of mine you know in fact in fact in the recent recruitment fair uh lots of people were asking me this question uh do i have to be a biz ad graduate in order to be recruited to the marketing department uh the answer to it is no in fact half of the marketing department is filled with physics graduates okay i'm not i'm not suggesting that you have to be a physics graduate to be uh recruited into my marketing department but it involves hell of a lot of common sense involves hell of a lot of number crunching it involves attraction it involves an articulate and clear thinking personality so do it these are the general qualities that we are actually looking for and we are looking for people as i was mentioning in sales marketing commercial which includes financial and management accounting as well as i t information technology as well as to run the production facility as a management trainee you come in of course you have to be trained to run production facility but ultimately you would be running the factory in singapore so these are the qualities of people calibre of people that we are looking for when we recruit for management trainees for next year okay now uh what i'll do is that now i i'd play the uh recruitment video uh it's about fifteen to twenty uh fifteen to eighteen minutes i'm know that it's about eighteen minutes long okay after which uh i i have a brochures of our my company uh describing what exactly i have told you as of now  and uhm perhaps if you have any questions to ask me after that uh i'd be more than willing to uh answer you okay 
Singapore	first of all let me introduce myself and uh what we are here for today we are we will have a talk uhm we will have a talk uhm with you and then this will this will be followed by a video uh uh after the talk and then i'll go through a couple of uh uh more detail on this career talk uhm but first of all i'm norman lee uhm i'm a process manager in charge of one of the operating sections in the pulau bukom refinery uhm uh what's the this talk will be all about i was uh told by my personnel department a couple of days ago uhm and they actually ask for a couple of uh people a couple of speakers uh indicating some senior people and some young people i thought they were asking me as a a young person but actually i was corrected very quickly on that especially now notice all of you in front of me here is uh rather refreshing uh sight okay now uhm what the talk would uh consist of as i had mentioned uh just now would be a a video uh presentation to start with in a couple of seconds uh and then we will have a a bit of a a overhead slides after that und then we will have another young speaker a true young speaker to come up and uh welcome question and answer questions so if we can have the lights off please and then uh we can show the video that was the uh uh short introduction uhm what i will try and do now is just to run through a couple of  word with all of you uhm to bring some details to uh what was talked about during the video let me first introduce you to shell singapore the shell companies in singapore is uh by any standards uh fairly large uh companies it has got uh six hundred uh senior staff uh this will be mainly uh graduate uh uh staff and a total of uh a thou just under two thousand staff altogether uh in functional division uh in the shell companies in singapore are made up of uh quite a number of uh diff different parts in manufacturing the main facilities are all concentrated in the pulau bukom refinery what was said on the video uh just now is already a little bit out of date in the sense that the pulau bukom refinery is the largest uh in the whole shell group uh with the recent investment which some of you may have seen in the news newspapers crude oil comes in from from all over from the middle east from indonesia from east malaysia and uh basically is refined in in a distillation unit in a secondary conversion unit a lot of it is very state of the art technology uh they are also state of the art technology when it comes to the computer control and uh the uh all the sophisticated uh data information systems that we have got on on the refinery uh to support all of this manufacturing facility in on on the pulau bukom vicinity are three main divisions the engineering division the operational division and technology division now as graduates uh you come in uh if you are in the uh civil electrical mechanical uh discipline uhm then you will basically come in to work in one of the engineering divisions as chemical enigineers you will come in to work as technologists who will be uh basically uh looking at uh improving efficiencies and so on so the whole team you know these three main divisions on pulau bukom serves to run the refinery in an efficient way to maintain the refinery and also to look at all all sorts of new projects and new major investments and so on then we come to chemicals the uh chemicals team in uh in singapore consist of uh selling and manufacturing uh word intermediate word  for petrols for detergents and so on uhm we are in a state of uhm asia pacific expansion and uh the chemical team is actually on a part of the growth uh market as a  word  the graduates uh joining chemicals in shell would basically be put very quickly into frontline uh development of uh word  market opportunities not only within singapore but also in the region so people will have to be travelling to our london factory to develop markets and to look for opportunities word and so on now uhm on marketing uh the marketing function uh in shell singapore basically i mean all of you see the shell petrol stations uh along along the roads and so on that is a large part of the uh marketing uh functions because everything to do got to do with uh to go from petrol to diesel to uh l p g and so on and of course uh even uh detergents uhm and graduates who join us in the marketing department you will be basically running uh will be basically running to portfolio customers industrial customers to give them support for their usage of products and also to develop new areas of uh trading and so on then we come to uh supply planning now supply planning is one of those uh activities that we have to have which is mainly stages in the central offices in uh the uh the uh head office in shell towers raffles place supply supply planning is very essential for ensuring the whole of uh that whole of bukom refinery is used to its optimum so all sorts of uh word deals and products deals are made in supply planning and the the uh people there are also looking at how to optimise the refinery now from the supply planning uh part one could actually jump into the highly uh uh affective uh oil-trading uh uh area where you know after one has acted as uh market analyst in supply planning you one can actually go into the tiny uh round-the-clock uh and and very exciting world of oil-trading then we come to the personnel function shell places a lot of importance on in the human resources so basically i mean the attention that we've given to making the best out of the people that shell has is given to the task i mean it's given to the uh uh opportunity of the line managers but to gauge and to help line managers in uh taking uh to facilitate their functions the the personnel function comes in personnel function for those of us who are who are who have a a inclination to actually to go into human relation uh and uh and and who would be very interactive with people the personnel function also ex word extreme amount of flexibility graduates joining us in the personnel function will actually go into uh looking into compensation and job evaluations and and all those little things behind the scene we come to the finance functions of course i mean shell uh being big the money is also big and the money money money all over the place you have got to have a whole bunch of accountants to look after the money to look after the oil to look after the stock so we have got management accounting we have got uh financial accounting and so on so forth word  so that is the financial uh area and of course uh last and not least in tune with the singapore scene of information technology uh shell is also having all the state-of-art system within its within its uh environment uhm basically data-processing telecoms uh corporate system everything becoming integrated word team and a team refinery scheduling the oil-trading world would just run uh with uh data at everyone's finger tips so it is a big challenge in the realm of the information technology area i would like now like to touch uh to give you a first of all a summary on the what a career in shell will actually mean i've given you a little bit of uhm uhm meat which you can take uh your teeth on as far as the actual job content in the various part of the company but which ever job the person actually goes into uh in the company there there there is a whole uh system of career planning uh within shell the opportunities in shell as you may see from the size and the expense of the company i mean it being an international company opportunities for personnel growth is uh tremendous uhm not only growth uh within uh shell in singapore but uh you know to for assignments abroad the ability to travel and opportunities to uh to actually get in touch with our colleagues our foreign colleagues the uh people who join shell are given early responsibility and and this we believe very we believe to be very important for people to feel useful in their job right from the very start training we believe in training we have a regional training uh facilities and we have also got uhm overseas uh courses which we we send our graduates and also uh uh staff who have got a certainly number of years to go on all these courses for personal uh development we have a a part of our regular uhm appraisal in order to let people know how well they are doing uhm how how what should they be doing different in order to be perform better in the company our whole our whole appraisal system is in place which uh gives people feedback uh to tell the individual you know they could be from the line management and they could be from personnel uhm what exactly you know they can do to be improving themselves i'll touch on this uh uh subject a little bit later and of course the last subject which i'm sure i mean everybody is uh uh has part of their priority the salary progression in shell uh how would i say how would i put out put it word i mean the uh it is the word it the performance related uh and potential related pay scale which i hope to touch on a little bit after one or two slide now i've mentioned about uh career development uhm quite specifically we talk about a graduate's progrssion uh development programme and this is something that we find is extremely valuable for us pushing uh graduates along the way when they're in the first couple years with the company we have uh we have the belief that it is important to spot talent so that people who are coming in we like to know their of capabilities and as early as possible and in doing so we are then in a position to help the uh graduates along their way their strengths will be emphasised and their weaknesses will be addressed and this whole uh uh scheme is basically set up to make use of their potential uh and abilities now the uh features of this graduate development programme is that every quarter every three months people will get assessed uh initially and feedback will be given to the people uh and the and then training would actually be also falling in place together with this uh assessment uh later on of course i mean the training would continue right through the whole uh career i talked about growth and development we emphasise the exposure we like people to be actually exposed to all sorts of different environments we like people to have we like people to have changing jobs so we are talking about people who actually go from job to job uh within uh two to three years and we like people uh to have a broad outlook now all these beliefs are basically uh driving us to to expose people by sending people around in the region by sending people overseas  and and this broad is broadens uh we call it broadening development for people will basically put them in in uh positions for future senior management now i come to the uh perhaps the more meaty issue ah before the pause gets too long let me continue uhm for the for graduates joining shell we talk about a a monthly salar salary of between two to two thousand five hundred dollars that range would be decided upon uh you know various circumstances like whether you've done n s or whether you are uhm uh whether you are whether you are a trained in a certain way or another 
Singapore	good afternoon i'm from the faculty of engineering and uhm for the last forty-five minutes before the tea break our group got together and for the first twenty minutes what we did was we spent that time introducing ourselves to one another and so we ended up with only twenty minutes to talk about teaching in large groups in fact uhm after the first twenty minutes professor elton walked into the room and said uh you know which stage of your discussion are you at and we said that we just finished introducing ourselves and he was a little surprised but we thought that it would be helpful since we were going to be together for the next few days to get to know a little bit about each other but for the remaining twenty minutes that we were together we went around and said something about what are some common difficulties or struggles we encounter when we first start lecturing and we tried to identify some common features or common problems which were faced by uhm the members in the group i think one area that cropped up was the area of how much material to present in a lecture and we had differing views i think there was one member who said that within an hour he tried to cover something in the region of thirty to thirty-five transparencies and uh the rest of us were a little surprised to say the least and someone else expressed a different experience whereby he was given three hours for a masters class and by the time i think about two hours was through he had finished everything so he declared an early end to the lecture and so we we talked about how much material one uh needs to present and i think this is very much subject dependent and also related to how much time you feel you should dwell on certain parts of your uh transparencies because it's probably not possible to say that one transparency is equal to exactly uhm five minutes or or less but the point that was brought up was that in engineering a lot of our work is mathematical in nature so how does one go about presenting uh mathematical equations or in a transparency form and uh i think we came to a conclusion that it was probably better to spend time and explaining something if we were going to present it rather than doing uh half uhm half-baked job of it so if we weren't going to spend time on it it's probably best not to present it those were some of the highlights of our discussion and i think i probably run out of five minutes now so i'll pass you to the next person that reminds me i have to keep my watch five minutes uh we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to discuss or at least that that's something that i do but not what the members did they chipped in with good discussions and we kind of uh first uh agree on uh use of transparencies that is it's something that is a must for a large lectures it helps students to uh focus uh on what is being taught and the slower students can find that as a guide uhm a route map so to speak then we discussed on the use of notes whether uhm it's a good idea to hand out notes to students uh some say it's good because it saves uh students' time in having to hunt down the uh uh reference text whereas some say it's bad because uh that will make students not read the textbooks and so uhm it was lively discussion and we concluded that uhm basically if you hand out notes uh you should not substitute for a textbook but should really help student to uh uh use the notes to help them understand the course better and then i concluded by asking if there were some uh secrets that some staff might want to share uh given that prof chow has shared with us some secret uh earlier on in a in a lecture and a member suggested that if students don't answer question being shy as they are you could ask them to write their answers to uh questions that are given out to them on papers and then ask them to exchange uh the papers with the colleagues and have someone else read out the answers in this case you'll prompt them to uh answer the questions and on that note i think we pretty much round up the uh forty-five minutes that we have uhm i'm not sure if i made the five minutes but but these are the few points that i have thank you my group started off with uh looking at some of the issues in uh small groups and uh the reason for this is that's because we are closer to uh that kind of teaching especially with the group but uh there are some pertinent questions that were raised like for example the the students' mentality especially when they are looking for setter word  answers uh whether this is something they brought into the classroom or they uh took it from the classroom the other point that was uh raised uhm in this small group teaching is that sometimes it is very difficult especially when students found out a way on how to specialise in activities uh they divide up their work and then they specialise on that particular part and they present it and if it is not their responsibility they will just leave it alone and therefore they couldn't keep up with the discussion of the particular group that presented when it comes to large group uh teaching is the problem of sheer numbers and the group felt that because of the sheer numbers the personal contact to the students the bonding with the students has been lost and uh special efforts would have to be made sometimes even outside the classroom uh to get back this relationship with the students uh because in speaking to the students in a large class a kind of rapport will have to be established in order to get the message through also in a large class teaching it was found that we need actually to have uh the attention of the students and the discussion went onto how to have a control of the whole class uh one staff mention that uhm the eye control is very important uhm the other mention that if we are going to get the attention then the we probably may need some rules now coming to this eye contact i just want to relate a personal experience of mine uhm eye contact is the meeting of eyes but uh sometimes when i lecture especially in my early days is more of the meeting of heads uh the reason is this that when i'm writing something on the transparencies the students see my head and when i look out they were copying the board and so i see their heads so the sometimes uhm the eye contact is being lost is more the meeting of heads just to uhm uh round up the uh discussion we also explore the possibility of brainstorming as uhm professor uh nathan has mention uh but our comment was that if we start off brainstorming and in the middle of a lecture and uh students starts talking to each other it may be very hard to actually stop them and if we have a sixty minutes lecture uh we could find that you have a time constraint thank you well thank you uhm to all the panel members here for their inputs uh there are four other groups out there uh can we we have some uh feedback from those groups the panel leaders for those groups before we we open it up all for general discussion what about the group uh from the arts and social science group one john john elliot  john elliot  thank you what about uh group two group two is uh doctor uh associate professor rahman okay actually we just uhm went on from where you ended in uh your talk of preparation presentation and reviews uh we had uh professor yeo and i prepared some transparencies and in the form of the handouts exactly the way we lecture so we were conducting the same thing uhm in advance to discuss to the three points you had preparation presentation and review we had added two more the first one was the interest and attitude towards teaching which we felt was a prerequisite to a effective teaching and then the lastly some specific issues and problems uhm in these uhm i think in the preparation uh point which was discussed to considerable length is that we had this uh category in the preparation we had several categories know your students and audience well and their background and so on before you can even prepare your lectures also you should know your material well and uh the question that was asked and it's a very valid question which almost took half of the time of the discussion is what happens if you get the subjects which are not your expertise and you are assigned to teach worse still if you are assigned to teach things at the last minute uh we all agreed that in order to prepare a good effective lecture you need a good amount of time sometimes weeks to get a very good lecture ready and what if three o'clock in the afternoon you are told that this is the course you will be teaching next day uhm very valid point probably uhm some lecturers if they are going to teach the same course in the next years and the following years they can take it alright from next year on i will have a easier time but if what if their courses keep on changing and they have to face this problem over and over again something which is worth looking into uhm in the methodology section of course the outline was very important the handout question was brought in and in the faculty of arts for example handouts are very discouraged uhm even though the students love it so what's the compromise and i think what we uh came to is the handouts should not replace the lectures themselves uh in our faculty every beginning of the year you'll have uh notice board full of these sale notices the students are selling notes and handouts from the previous years even the essays from the previous exam answers and all that sort of thing so if these can be replaced obviously why should the students come to the lecture to begin with they might just buy those and study those and pass the exam uhm presentation and delivery the uhm lecturer's style we went through these the manner of delivery one important point which was emphasised during this manner of delivery was to keep the language especially for the first year students especially in our faculty where a lot of our students come from very various background uhm business students sciences students taking arts and so on and they maybe taking say geography or whatever and they never had geography before and suddenly they have to face these so one has to keep the professional language to the minimum and to the level of the poorest the student in the group uhm the use of the audio-visual again uhm many of us show videos or things like that they have to be more interactive not just passive uhm in the review the feedback we discussed uhm the formal feedback which our faculty has and i guess other faculties do too at the end of the year uhm one could debate about the validity of that as far as the improvement is teaching is concerned 
Singapore	thank you uh annie uhm i'm sure you'll all agree with me that uh doctor annie koh has prepared us so well uh in her presentation that the task for the uh resource persons were made very much easier when i started discussing with my group i used the handout which uh doctor annie koh uh circulated we started with uh question one i uh asked the group to consider question one and from which we said we will then go on to the other questions as we started on question one we went along and then gradually we found that uh we were moving into so many areas and i lost track of time which which means that uhm i have not been quite uh uh uh a very good facilitator in that way uh i lost track of time and before we knew we had only fifteen minutes for tea so i'll just uh uh summarise a little bit of uh the just the key points that uh my faculty uh has raised they have raised in our discussions a lot of the use of small groups i think uh will there'll be a lot of overlaps uh amongst faculties so what i will uh concentrate upon is uh the use of small groups in clinical teaching in the faculty of medicine essentially uh four there are four areas uh in which small groups uh can be used one is in the to try and develop practice practical skills in uh the examination of patients uh not in the at this stage in the first stage not actually examining the patient as such but uh being taught by the tutor how the procedure can take place and so forth uh here a group of size of about six uh is considered uh to be about optimum the other area in which small groups are used uhm will be in taking the history of patients analysing the history and so forth uh what they call uh clucking word skills you cluck your patients and this is where again uh small groups would be very useful uh to carry on this educational exercise and then the other the next area is one of the uh clinical case studies where you look at actual uh not actual you you you're presented with a a problem uh say asthma or high blood pressure and so forth and you then discuss with your groups now of course uh this first three that which i've mentioned they are they cover more or less the the same uh requirements that one would want for small groups in i think other areas of teaching as well and the last area which i'm going to mention is in the actual examination of patients this is where we had a lot of discussion and some were very entertaining uhm here in the case of actual examination of patients uh it was brought out very clearly that very important is that small group here means really very small groups uh where it boils down to only one or two students uh to the patient the problems of course uh as i mention it i'm sure it'll become obvious to you uh patients cannot be inconvenienced too much with too many uh students looking down at them and a particular our colleague in obstetrics and gynecology brought out a particular problem in that when you are examining uh word  it becomes very very difficult for particularly male students examining female students so this is an area where uh small group really means very small group uh you can afford to have twenty uhm students uh looking uh uh at patients and uh looking at the same patient over and over again uh here this applies equally well to dentistry because you're looking at the other word which is uh not very big you know uh so you can't have uh too many patients uh uh students uh looking in that small little area so our colleagues in dentistry uh also reflected that they have the same problem and there in uh lies the uh use of very small groups uh in addition to what i've said uh there are there were some suggestions as to how we could try and reduce this the use of patients to a minimum uhm one of which is uh to try and use close circuit t v of various procedures and our colleague in optomology uh uh mention two uh uh uh uhm ways that they go about this one is they use audio-visual aids they use actual slides of eye conditions actual slides of pa taken from patients they also of course have a problem because very often in an eye examination there is a a a a small light source uh you know into the eye of the patient you cannot have too many students looking around like that so they try to overcome uh uh as best as they can while it is not a replacement for actual patient examination it becomes uh uh uh it complements and it hopefully you can then reduce the need to expose the student uh to uh to too many patient examinations so they use audio-visual aids either slides of actual condition eye conditions or they also have uh close circuit t v whereby the surgeon is actually operating uh the students are watching the operation on t v and the surgeon is in communication so there is possibility of crosstalk even while the operation is going on now the other point that emerged from our discussions is that here unlike the use of small groups in uh uh other situations this is actually an a real situation where the teacher is himself uh being observed by the student every moment of his how he relates to the patient how he communicates with the patient is now in fact being observed by his students and this is where our colleagues felt that this is a situation where teachers can provide that inspiration and provide or or make himself the role model we also have heard of uh failures towards this direction we have heard of cases where teachers have excel as role models so these are some our problems and uh uh uh the users of uh small groups in the clinical setting we concluded by uh drawing attention to one point and that is that if we are talking about small groups then we should totally avoid using it as a mini lecture we consider it a sin uh to use small groups and then making it into a mini lecture and uh we think that you shouldn't earn your salary if that's the case thank you prof gwee oh dear i think my salary have been halved already okay uh prof yong will now address us i'm going to keep the questions till after all the panelists have the chance to voice their opinions first prof right thank you uh good morning ladies and gentlemen uh first uh what i learn from this morning uh is that uh have to provide a road map before you start something so within the five minutes that i'm allocated i'll spend the first minute on telling what is the scope of our discussion three minutes on what we actually discussed and one minute to wind it up now uh actually originally uh at least from the resource person point of view i plan to actually focus on a few topics that uh annie has so kindly drafted up in in in in a short write up but later on the participant felt that uh we should just concentrate on the essence of what small group teaching really is and uh what we have is that it's remarkable that we have a consensus of opinion within the different departments on actually the problems that we are facing in the engineering faculty uh originally the definition for small group teaching we thought we could actually expand it to include uh uh uh lectures with a small numbers of students as well as tutorial but uh again we somehow converge to tutorials so really when we now think about small group teaching somehow uh we we are thinking more of tutorials now the consensus is that uh we have uh unfortunately an unhealthy practice in the engine faculty in the sense that the our our tutorial perhaps are slightly different from the way tutorials are conducted perhaps in the other faculties like arts and social uh the reason is being technical the a lot of cases involves problem-solving and uh somehow the comments from most of the participants is that the because they are problem-solving uh tutors tend to set deterministic problem in other words these are basically closed end solutions and as a result the what the students does is that uh they'll just probably go up to the board write out the solutions and if the solutions are okay no comment if the solution is not okay the tutor will then start to ask questions perhaps his uh his uh own colleagues or students will also ask questions but we felt that that is not a healthy practice uh the real world outside basically is not so deterministic uh it is more on tackling open-ended issues which involves a lot of disciplines but we felt that we are hampered by the by the fact that uh seems to be in the system and partly the teachers ourselves are responsible for this system in the sense that from the day year one we give them sets out of uh problems with set answers occasionally with uh solutions given and these are more or less targeted towards an examinated an examination oriented system in other words we provide tutorials to the examination as an end and we thought that again that is an unhealthy practice and the problem also compounded by the fact that we have teaching evaluation at engineering faculty and that if the tutor are not do not give the exam give model answers or solutions or to give lecture notes to supplement he'll get a poor grading in his in an evaluation uh so the practice in the first year is such that the uh lecture notes are given to students uh tutorial solutions are given to the extent certain cases model answers are also given and the net result is that these text compounded year after year even when they reach final-year students who are about to graduate they are still un answering for lecture notes model answers and this is what we find uh something unhealthy now we have uh come up with the problems but uh by the time we have discussed the problems we don't we the time was up we we didn't have much time to look in the solution but uh what they generally agreed is that this has to be brought up the the philosophy of the the system of conducting tutorial in the faculty has to change so at this point i can only reassure the participants that the matter we'll bring it up to the our own faculty teaching methodology committee and also to the faculty administration and we'll what can be done so on hindsight at least uh this seminar has brought out some some note uh significant problem uh that we face in the faculty now we have another minor problem was brought up towards the end and that was the how do we uh allow how do we prevent students from choosing their tutorial groups in other words again the engineering faculty we assign our students to certain tutorial groups so they may be something like uh ten tutorial groups with ten different lecturers and we notice that some students they just move around tutorial groups in preference of certain lecturers and of course again this is an unhealthy uh  in certain departments we take attendance to make sure that the students stay within the group in certain departments they do not follow again this is a practice that perhaps we we we need probably more time or or maybe some other workshops to resolve this itself uh that didn't leave much time to to talk anything further it was still general we we however are fortunate we focus on something that the that the rest of the departments actually have the same problem and as i said this uh so in summary basically the problem is one on on the conduct of the tutorial itself and of the expectation of students to expect model answers and handout and the most important is that we'll like to change our tutorial from a deterministic kind of problemsolving to a more open-ended thinking and this is uh i presume that is the theme of of what annie koh has tried to say in in the very first lecture 
Singapore	now i had elected to speak from here uh for the simple reason that i do not have any transparencies to show now the final exam in n u s is really an institution and i think for even those of us who may not have been educated here we know that as a fact i think uh if not before then by the time you reach uh this point in the uh seminar series you have known that now the students in the days when the final exam is the only yardstick by which they are measure i think they are caught between two resignations let me explain before the exam their motto seems to be or they are rather resign to the fact that the sooner you fall behind the longer you have to catch up so they operate on that principle and indeed it's a very well uhm uh established principle because from july anywhere from july until uhm february you have a lot of time to catch up right if you fall behind soon enough and after the exam they are resign to the fact that uh and i quote from somewhere education is what's survives when what has been examined has been forgotten right because then it's too late to do anything anyway so might as well uh resign yourself to that now this uh very strange phenomena of placing the final exam as the focal point of the year and in some sense the whole uh three or four years that n u s student have uh to spend uh at this campus uh produce a really uh unique set of problems for people on both sides of the examination now i speak not as an educationist and and really i do not have uh very profound thoughts on the subject but i speak as a person who has come through the system uh mostly on the side of the staff because my my own education is largely not from n u s and uh i hope to share some of those with you now now after have the students have gone through about three of those final exams or in some cases four i'm sure many of them could almost reside the examiner's injunction from the microphone right it goes something like blah blah blah blah blah blah and and then it ends with something like expulsion from the university right and then after a while i say you may start now i think it's something like that right that's what i you call anyway and and then they bury their head right into their examination paper and they keep going now why why why do they sit through that and what are the justifications for having the exam in the group discussion that we had just now to my surprise passion do run high uh on why we had examinations and not other form of assessment uhm or rather why are no other forms of assessment use more profitably in our educational process and the discussion already word run to national objectives how we want to play in the big league and so on to philosophical issues and the technical terms that come out baffle even me you know because i'm not one of those that understand all the normatives summative word and whatever uh uh procedures that are going on examination but let me say uh in defence of the final exam since uh i have to that the common denominator principle plays a large part and i i firmly believe in it the idea is that the level the the plain field should be level because if you allow uhm the staff members to do their own assessment then we know all the problems that can come out of it i mean i come from the business administration faculty and we do have some continuous assessment components and i must confess that they are some irregularities that uh would not be so prominent in the final let me just quote a few when you have quizzes that are set and not at the same time and on the same place uh you are bound to have some problems with uhm the standards being different because you know n u s students are so well-informed they operate in a in a a market of perfect information coming from my faculty if you give an exam at two o'clock you cannot repeat the same exam at four o'clock you know otherwise they you know you most of the students will get one hundred per cent so because of that you have real problems and then of course you know in the final exam when you grade questions when you are going through the scripts you do not know who are answering the questions unless they use special kind of colour ink or something to signal to you but that is usually not the case for continuous assessment you do know except perhaps you make them quizzes uh you do know the and and uh students are not very happy about that yes you can imagine and of course uhm if you conduct quizzes as we do during tutorial groups they are actually very distinct possibility of student cheating sometimes you could almost tell that they are cheating it's just that you couldn't put quite your finger on it because you know if they are not really caught red-handed really that's the problem and in the final exam much of this is eliminated because everybody sits on a a presumably identical uh chair and they during that three hours perform and then they walk out and everybody can can see that it's quite fair or is it quite fair now let me just mention then in the next few minutes some of the problems that are real and not so much theoretical first of all we assume the examiner care about setting a good exam or even a fair exam uh what do you mean by good well we have some exposition on that issue uh during uh doctor pang's uh session and also actually in our group discussion we have to clarify for student the content expectation right i mean even that sometimes is not done very well uh from my personal experience and the fact that the final exam is actually conducted after the various uhm significant student evaluation process by that is the time and we are evaluated by students right the fact that the final exam is after that actually have some bearing on the way it's conducted i mean this again i speak from personal experience because somehow or other is like they they don't have a they don't have the final say you have the final say right okay that's one point secondly there is always the charge that uh it's not a good idea to put all the eggs in one basket and we we know all the problem with that and thirdly there is uh the mechanics of how the exam is uhm conducted now we talk about a level playing field but you know some student happen to sit below the air-conditioner and you you know i have one student who actually was near freezing this time and and you know she said that you know i was feeling so cold so i searched around in the end i just switched off that particular air-conditioner for her okay now if she didn't do well she has a good reason not to do well right and you know that students that are nearer the entrance actually might get anything up to one minute more to read the examination you all know that because it takes a long time to walk from one end of world trade centre to the other end and when collecting the papers and this is something that i raised with the registrar's office actually uh once when i was a young energetic lecturer that the the students uh many students do not honour the rule of put down your pen or stop writing now whatever the the instructor said and they keep writing because they know that nobody get penalised for it they get the a a back look i mean from the person collecting that's about it and i i feel that things can be done about it but but this is a real problem and thirdly with technology so advance today or rather lastly you have problem with calculators now the typical registrar office personnel or the typical invigilator cannot tell the difference between a calculator with only four functions and one that has one megabite of memory and at the level where i'm teaching it makes a lot of difference let me tell you that and then there is the grading system now we know uh that the examiner is under very great pressure to finish all the scripts right and uh at one time we have got six hundred and sixty student taking statistics in second year and to finish that in a short time is a not a easy thing to do and so all the concomitant problems about consistency and all that all comes in and these are real problems too ah uhm and then marks recordings can uh contain mistake in that we've seen those happening and then uh the grade adjustment is not consistent i mean there is a case uh of uhm a course having about twenty-five as in one year and the following year has over two hundred as because of some word  so let me uh then come to the last point then really the problem one of the main problem of examination as uh it is conducted in this university for for the final exam is that student have really no way of uh having any feedback from the final exam the feedback is really only one way so we talk about trying to make the examination a learning process i mean in theory it's a a good thing to be able to aim for but for many students really it's the bottleneck they all have to go through now what can be done to solve some of these problem now that would of course take another half-an-hour but i won't uh i would spare you that i think one possibility is to make it a practice a for at least for the subjects uh which are are what is term objective for the examiner to pose some kind of sketches how things should be solved immediately after the exam on the notice board because i i feel that the learning uh process is incomplete ha if a person went through three hours trying to solve some problems and they're never told what the answer was of course for certain things you can't i mean trying to comment on some shakespeare sonnets for instance i mean there is no model answer to that i could well understand but certain things the answers are clear and we must give the student a chance to look at what they are now before they forget it before they can say and i quote again educationist what survives when what has been examined has been forgotten we don't want them to say that all the time do we thank you well as you know my assignment is continuous assessment i would not have any big uh statement to make or big theorem or theory to advance uh what i want to talk about will be some problems uh connected with my own personal experience and for that purpose i think it'll be useful if i give if i say a few words about where which department i come from and so on a bit about the department i'm from the department of mathematics this department is a very big one with something like hundred and five staff members and we teach about four hundred sorry four thousand two hundred undergraduate students every year  some of our courses are huge more than six hundred students and our tutorial groups may be as big as twenty-five students involving perhaps as many as eight tutors covering forty-two tutorial groups or for the same course 
Singapore	well i don't know about the rest of you but i enjoyed that presentation by doctor uh professor elton immensely and the i was reacting right through his uh his uh lecture and i would like to share some of the thoughts with you i think one has to be careful uhm in terms of what we think we can achieve at the university or at any institution of learning i believe that education is not confine nor limited to formal institutions there are other channels of education in a family in the churches uh in community uh organisations and uh life experiences that one goes through some it may be a little bit unfair to demand of an institution like this that we need all the aims of education that everyone who passes through our portals and and uh graduate uh will become quotes unquotes educated men and women in the sense that has uh professor elton has uh aptly described as i was listening to him and all the various wonderful objectives that uh we ought to be working for i felt grossly inadequate not up to it disqualified to be the kind of teacher lecturer that can fulfill those objectives i say that not to discourage you but i say that to provoke you into thinking you see let's take a typical lecturer how well qualified is he to do this educating function he's a graduate like the rest of us maybe he's has first class honours second upper he goes for a p h d abroad and he's highly specialised in that particular field his experiences in life limited to campuses a little bit off campus emotional some stable some unstable some some in between mentally you know various stages various degrees but you can say of him that he is vitally interested in his subject area immerse in it and is and expect in it and developing further expertise in it then he goes before the classroom his very first class he expects all the students to be graduate student level so he throws all he knows at them and finds that they are totally out of depth he learns over the years that he has to learn to communicate that he cannot throw the things that he is familiar with and assume that they can pick up like that because there's an idiom there's a language of the subject matter that one one has there are paradigms to learn models uh to emulate and to present and theories into which to cramp all the facts that we see around us so the question is how does he communicate even the rudiments that he needs to communicate to the students let alone motivate them in other areas then take the viewpoint of the student is he graduate student calibre is he of our level that you know we can pick things up like that react to a lecture like that and start thinking of all kinds of ideas think you must think of the average student are you communicating are we communicating successfully to the average student i go i measure myself that way as i lecture i like to look at my students when i see them blank looking in in hokkien they say 'lei boh kiew' meaning can't catch the ball can't catch what i'm saying then i go back over the ground again when i see them smiling i say ah i've achieved something and then when the essays come in in the tutorials when they react then my heart sinks again because i thought they understood but clearly they didn't understand so i said well i've got to start over again how do i communicate how do i communicate to people who are average intelligence now it doesn't mean that if somebody gets uh average grade or mediocre grade that that person is gonna be a failure in life i've witnessed many of my colleagues before third class honours general degree but they went out to be outstanding successes in life what made the difference i believe the university provides education outside the classroom the various avenues that are available the societies the clubs i as a student was active i was a debater i was an organiser of forums and so on i took part in forums and i believe that these other extra curricular avenues develop areas of a student that we can't develop and we better confess that we can't develop them at the same time too let's recognise that we cannot look after their emotional needs many students have emotional problems and i find that uh sometimes talking to them sometimes being able to help them financially or to get them to a counsellor is very helpful because if they are emotionally in conflict then they can't do well so there are many many factors many other factors which uh professor elton did not mention but within one hour he couldn't he couldn't have mention but i think we should take all these into consideration and my approach would be given our limited resources what's the best we can do before we motivate students are we ourselves motivated i have lecturers in the past at stanford university who openly told us told the students i don't get promoted for good teaching i get promoted for good research so why should i bother now if if lecturers carry this kind of attitude they're not motivated in teaching they just come and do everything dot dot dot dot dot doesn't matter whether half the students are asleep and then examine them set topics and so on you can get by concentrate on your research and do very well but what's the result are we interested in motivating students and how should we go about it do we present a a lecture that is well-rounded a b c d if and but and so on all conditions now if you did that students go to sleep there's another way of presenting chicago style get them agitated excited because you say things that you know they they are not comfortable with but they don't know how to rebut you and that makes them you know go and look at the books and come out with something that's why chicago has produced so many nobel prize winners okay now there are different approaches we can use but the main thing is can we interest the students can we motivate them can we get them excited you see we are excited about our areas of interest can we communicate this excitement to them this enthusiasm to them if we can i think we've gone a long way thank you very much let me have my next speaker i don't know how many minutes i took doctor andy hor please when the subject of motivating the student was given to me i found that it was a difficult task the first thing i did was to look at the dictionary what motivation means and how i would define it for the discussion i have not looked at uh any literature on that the subject i have collected my thoughts as a practising teacher on this so what i will do is i'll define it the way i feel it's applicable for student learning look at the forms or factors that influence uh student motivation finally summarise and would make out the case for student motivation in a university setup the best definition i could make out for motivation is a process of arousing an interest for action ah that's the way i quote the define it for this purpose because there were other definition the word is one the meaning are many but i think this is the one that came closer to motivation that is motivation is a driving force and this force affects student learning it can come instantly or is a slow process but it must be sustained then only we have motivation the driving force or the motivation can come from within or from ithout/result word for learning to take place but the external force that we say for motivation must eventually become within and must be self-generated for learning to go on so though we say external or internal the external must eventually come internal in the student for sustained uh learning you might also ask the question why motivate students uh in a university setup they are tertiary students they are adults is motivation necessary i feel motivation is necessary because the time a student comes to university's very short it may be three years or five years as in the medical faculty during that period they are undergoing a transformation it's a short period you know and during this period of transformation that is as professor elton said they are preparing for life we can influence them so they learn and continue to learn so there is a need for uh motivation word in a university setup as an illustration i thought i would take my subject biology or medicine if we take a bone cell or how bone is formed and here this similar one would be a parallel rubic word learning we need a cell we need nourishment and we need a stimulus however appropriate the cell is unless you have a stimulus and nourishment the cell cannot produce bone similarly how uh good the student is unless we have the nourishment and the stimulus we cannot get our learning so this is very vital so i thought i would illustrate it that way i shall look at the some of the factors or forms in which i feel are important uh for motivation for learning the first one i take is the teacher as a stimulus or driving force he must love to teach be committed and be concerned for the student be inspiring and have a infectious enthusiasm if you look back uh inspiring teachers have always attracted the students to their discipline they do a deeper learning of the subject and they subsequently devoted their life in that discipline whether it is medicine science or art and i think that comes through motivation and to do motivation you need close contact and that is the form it must take between the student and teacher in addition as it was said earlier they must not put off or kill student enthusiasm they must identify the good ones and the bad ones as you said so that we look at the good ones and make them better and also identify the ones at risk and see that they do not fall by the wayside in addition i think a good teacher motivates i feel through demonstrating a mind at work uh be it analysis in analysis in synthesis or problem-solving skills and this method i feel attracts students to learning and motivates them secondly i shall consider the role of the faculty and a department as a stimulus or driving force for student learning for motivation though we can say the responsibility for learning is that of the student and the teacher i think we must also consider in addition the faculty and the departments have a definite role in motivating not only must they they have a role it must be very transparent to the student that they are committed to this and they must demonstrate this then it pervades down the whole faculty and the department and improves learning thirdly i want to look at the role of friends peers in the class for motivation our students are usually motivated by group learning with their friends it may be while in the class or even outside the class and this can trigger and sustain motivation and i feel this must be also be encouraged for motivation fourthly i come to assessment and examination which professor elton touched on as a factor for motivation student learning  i think our assessment methods have an impact on students' learning but we must also take into account the students will also learn to pass examinations therefore our assessment methods can be changed and geared to stimulate a deep learning and in addition to achieving our objectives 
Singapore	okay it's past ten now and i don't think there're any other people coming if they can and if they do come well they just come in right uhm my name is dahlia i'm a reference librarian and uh this tutorial is actually to acquaint all of you with linc and the resources in the library especially our new toy the cd-rom and before i start how many of you have problems using linc what kind of problems do you encounter do you feel comfortable with it can you find everything that you want from linc  student: what do you mean that we have the book but it's not in linc okay our system just started running for about about two years or so so we're still encountering a lot of word  problems uhm all materials from 1980 onward should be in linc prior to that they will be in micro on microfiche and in our old database so we have not fully integrated everything right now have you used national library's uhm opec system  student  it's almost the same 'cause it's the first version this is the enhanced version and if we use national library's uhm opec system you can place reservations you can check your borrow and records you can find out whether that particular book is on loan or not at the moment linc does not cannot do that because it is not fully integrated all the other parts will take time and uh because of that they don't seek your co-operation right i think most of the time the problems that you have is not knowing which particular menu to choose from which particular item on the menu to choose from whether to use title personal authors keywords right and when you check a journal article you check you tend to look at the journal title instead of the journal the title of the journal instead of the articles right i have a feeling that you look at let's say okay dr leo suryadinata wrote something on overseas chinese in asian survey instead of looking at asian survey all of you start keying in overseas chinese right some of you do i mean i i i i mean a lot of students come up to me and have have that kind of problems okay basically linc is made up of all titles we have titles of books titles of journals in linc okay the i-copies which are individual chapters from various journals they're not in if you want to find out a particular article on let's say chinese foreign policy indonesian foreign policy anything like that from journals you have to look up abstracts and indexes we have that in the reference section but i doubt if many people use it okay that's a very useful source of information because a lot of uh materials on political science are written in journals they're faster if you write a book you have to wait what at least a year before before it's published but journal articles you know it comes up very regularly you don't have to wait through three hundred pages or eight hundred pages of it you know usually it's about twenty pages or less everything is there so i'm going to demonstrate linc problems that i think students face well those are the problems that they bring to the librarians at the information desk okay okay titles when you use titles you must make sure that you use the exact title of the book or the journal you can use let's say bits and pieces of it you know you can leave out 'and' 'the' all these articles but if you want to retrieve very fast you use the exact title 'writing asian survey' or maybe the title of the book is 'the rise and fall of mao tse tong' write the whole thing then you can get it immediately but if you were to type in you know only a few words the main words in that title then you have to go through the keyword search some people when they get that keyword search you know oh there is no exact match they just give up and leave no you should not leave you should go through the keyword search combine the all the words then come up with that title personal authors do your you use uhm surnames first in most of the names but for malay names you use as it is don't use the last name first organisations and conferences organisations if you want to look up anything on the ministry of foreign affairs monetary authority of singapore you use that one especially monetary authority of singapore monthly statistics we have the yearbook of stats at the info desk but the monthly quarterly there're all in the uhn serials department or the current periodicals department as everybody calls it conference names well there are so many conferences all over the place it's very very useful es especially for the engineering students because they depend a great deal on conferences and uhm symposiums subject headings ah ha that's the problem i think that's the major problem everybody else subject headings are not you know transportation that's it no tran when you use subject headings you must use this library of congress subject headings we use this so that you can retrieve as much information on a particular subject for example you want something on mrt singapore calls it mrt london it's called the tube or the underground in new york it's called the underground you see all in hong kong it's all is called the ntrc or something like that so all the different countries call it differently in in san francisco it's called bart b-a-r-t so you call it differently there are five of us alright and each of us have different names for it how on earth are we going to find it so we have subject headings to standardize all these terms another example is like battered women or abused women you say battered women i say abused women if we don't see things eye to eye we don't meet each other and talk about the same things nobody will be able to find out anything you won't be able to find out the articles or the books that i write and i won't be able to find out what you have written on that particular subject so you have to standardize so that's why we use the library of congress of subject headings so you don't use your own uhm keywords or terms in it okay then you have the series title ah that's another tricky one because a lot of students type in the title of the journal under series title and you can't find it at all one very good example very good illustration of umm series title is mills and boons that's a series title okay  laughter from the floor  some books they have to this particular series that's used but you know i think mills and boons is a very very good example okay keywords keyword is a particular word which appears in all the various fields meaning these are fields titles personal authors this is one field this is second field this is third field okay keywords like the keyword japan it can appear in title it can appear in organisation it can appear in subject series title so maybe if you look under titles japan there are hundred titles it says japan and singapore the people of japan the women of japan or something like that all the books with titles japan now i don't know if anybody's anybody has been called japan nah you can try we've organisations like uh miti you know uhm whatever japan trade and industry that sort of thing subject headings japan and then japan is subdivided into history literature uhm economy transportation okay you use title keywords so when you use keywords it picks up from all the various fields so altogether you might end up to a thousand let's say this is five hundred this is a hundred this is another two hundred so you know it picked up so that's that's where you get the keyword and the danger about using keywords is that you might end up retrieving information that you don't need you want japanese foreign policy if you use keyword you just type in japan it lists out everything and anything on japan japan and arts and culture japan japanese history japanese politics japanese humour japanese films so you have to be careful you have to know what you're searching for but that does not mean that you only stop at one if you're going to do japan foreign policy you just stick to subject headings when you're searching for information that's not that's not the way just imagine you're a detective you have to cover all the various angles so you have to try the titles you have to try subject headings as well as keywords okay i'll show you what i'll show it to you but if i do that i have to start this all over again i'll just demonstrate the title features okay how do you know whether that particular title is a book or a journal do you guess from the title okay i'll use title alright the asian survey it's only one journal the asian survey but it come up comes out twice because this one has no full-stop and this one has full-stop this is all part of computer technology okay when you get this you press a okay this is the full display when you only have one title they will automatically give you the full display full display the difference is you have subject you have names here you don't have you see in a brief display you don't have all these things volume for march nineteen sixty one ecetera ecetera okay okay i'll show you the brief format just type b for brief format this is the brief format how do you know find how do you know whether it's a journal or not look at at this copy description volume one nineteen sixty one dash it does not mean we only have nineteen sixty one we 've started buying from nineteen sixty one onwards dash that there're still others if you see an asterisk that means nineteen sixty one dash nineteen seventy asterisk that means the last issue that we have is nineteen seventy if you have books you're looking at books they don't have this so that's the difference that's how you find out anything can be in tamil it can be in in whatever in greek or in russian you see that you know call number the call number is this one or that's uhm some of the let's say you see u asterisk whatever it is okay ah those some those are just part of our cataloging rules so that one that's alright you see oh small f means folio stands for folio folio means books that are not uh bigger than normal size so we usually shelve them at the last two shelves because we cannot accommodate them in the normal size shelves you see most of the books are about what this twenty-three inches or something like i think two cm then if it's uh bigger than that you think you're gonna have usually the last let's say you have da from d to dz so after dz of the normal size books then you have the folio books the f books okay okay because of system fully integrated you only see cl that means if it's fully integrated you see clms which is main shelves main shelf meaning also open shelf you can borrow the book clbp bound periodicals clcs close stack that means we cannot put all our materials especially journals on the shelf  we just don't have space so the material that's kept in bound periodicals starts from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty-nine to nineteen ninety and the rest will be in our close stack our storeroom so you have to go to the query counter fill in a search card or a close stack slip this one mhm mhm then the staff will go down twice a day to hoo collect your books that you've requested if you come in now and ask them to do it you know you have to wait you know because they only go down twice a day we can't afford to do that all the time because we have a whole stack of slips student) past year for those that are no no no no those are kept those are the uh uhm the the bound periodicals you can jolly well go down and get it but those prior to that from nineteen sixty one to let's say nineteen seventy-nine okay they're kept in our uh uhm storeroom okay uhm those are journals same with some books where especially when we have multiple copies too many copies okay right now it can't really tell you you can check with query counter whether the book is on loan or not just cannot tell maybe if you've used national library system you can see that you know each volume or each each year it depends on how they bound they bind it will have uhm different bar code number and you know then you'll have to scroll through from nineteen sixty-one that's assuming that nineteen six each year has been bound one volume so you have let's say until seventy-one there're ten so on about thirty volumes but there are some journals that start from eighteen something eighteen eighty-eight so you just have to sit down and scroll through page by page and page until you find out the volume you're looking for that's journals for you okay do you have any particular title in mind that you want to search student okay you want to go student okay if you want to go back to the other page you just press r for reselect reselect student you have uh let's say twenty items okay anytime you want to get out you either press uhm function eight i think you need to stop or you press full stop return let's see okay let's look at i mean you know when you use keywords or when you use subject headings or titles don't be so foolish as to type in let's say indonesia because you'll get a million and one items okay you get you have this right if okay this is item number one and for this particular heading there is one alright so your main the main thing is to get this so ah let's say you want to look at number four which is indonesia - a profile if you press four press enter it'll show you what you just selected then let's say you want to look at number four number thirteen number twenty-seven okay anytime you want to go back you just press r okay then you have to use the gather function which is g you can add another key word if you want let's say keyword you just press key and then you get what you want okay let's say you use gather four press enter for next page press g again let's say eleven until fifteen after you've gathered all those things then you press l for list anythime you want to go back you know don't worry you know you can always go stan go astern just press r for reselect okay in process you've seen that before haven't you in process that means we're still processing the book and six million dollar question is when will it arrive don't know when okay when will it appear okay you know this right this is law main shelf law library central library call number one so in future everything will be like this and then you have the number of copies so you don't have to go round searching asking everybody how many copies do you have in the library one seven ten everything will be there okay if you want to look at the full format of let's say number two just press f space two full format okay you press b you get brief format you scan okay you want to see number three but you don't want to see the full format i mean it's very disjointed you want to go on to the next page you just press b space three number three's is at the top 
Singapore	good afternoon ah my name is iris ching and and i'm the software consultants welcome you to our this easy asset ii and easy cash seminar so uh before i explain into our package of uh computerising the fixed asset which is the first session of the seminar and the second session will be on easy cash which is the general ledger package plus the cash management system session i will like to briefly explain ah what actually how you can successfully use our package to computerise your system okay uh our system runs mainly all on pc-base and uh you could use a ibm compatible pc or running on an ms-dos system which can be running on version five or below and uh it goes on an unlimited databased system okay now if you are looking into uh how many of you are actually looking into a g/l package over here yourself is it and uh what kind of g/l package you are looking into a multiuser or a single-user single-user so it's no problem because our system runs on a single-user basis and it has this ah multi passwords whereby you will give you this security purposes and uh what about yourself eileen not at the moment ya i have seen ah in word and you are also looking into fixed asset system you are looking into that ah okay this easy asset ii is a new upgrade or we call it a new release version for this year previously we know it's known as easy asset and the package for this one compared to the old version there's a difference is this one goes unlimited database the other version is limit up to a thousand five of records it can enter now this one goes unlimited so you don't have to worry about the easy asset ii if you have number on or you call the volume of assets increasing per year then you will not have this problem of you know up to a certain limit you cannot carry on your system so okay let me run down this system for you so that you could understand better of the features and also the operations of it now as you can see this is the introduction whereby it tells you that this package is developed by our own company and it's developed in singapore okay specially for the singapore office but we also cater for oversea office because fixed asset system is more or less quite uh i should say it's quite consistent throughout internationally the laws of uh supposing like the functions like depreciation by how many straight line methods and all that or balancing on reducing balance or double declining balance so it's more or less quite standard in the sense okay the first thing you can see that over over your left side if i'm going to sit this way it's going to be over my left side the database window is goes unlimited database so you can have number of databases there does not matter it can scroll on and on you have number of companies if you are using just one package to control number of companies' assets so you can just use a macro key and zoom into any one of these database that you already built in the system okay let's say this is the database that you have put in the system call the ea2sam and you are going into the period okay the fiscal period depends on how you identify your fiscal period let's say you go into a fiscal period of twelve which is you classify that now your fiscal period is december okay and you proceed on enter your password now your password here allows you you can see it allows you more than enough okay and right over here once you enter into this password you will come to the actual main menu and you can start having your computerisation first of all building the parameter set okay under this parameter set you have what you call miscellaneous parameters where this is where you set up okay you're start off computerisation fiscal period is it you're starting as a fiscal period six okay let's say it's six is your fiscal period now you can see the change automatically over there the period end date which means your first fiscal period accounting month is on june thirtieth of june nineteen-ninety-one ending and your last fiscal period twelve will be ending thirty-first may nineteen-ninety-two you do not have to go into that particular parameters to set the date there is an auto-control okay now if you set your this first accounting period first fiscal accounting period month as one which is january now you go and change go right into a company's name you can see that it overrides your first fiscal period becomes thirty-first january ninety-one and your ending fiscal period twelve is thirty-first december ninety-one so this is how our system controls over the parameters now if you are going into the subsequent years of ninety-two okay all you require is you put in the current accounting year which is ninety-two now you can see over there on the period end-date it has automatically change for you to nineteen-ninety-two okay so this is how the computerisation helps you to speed up in certain ways of control and right over here you put in the company's profile which is your company's name the address and the other information okay over here you can see that you will have to enter the standard currency okay your standard currency can be you can controlled as us dollar as your standard company's currency or you use singapore dollar as a standard currency control so you can enter over here and this means that how many decimal place are you giving two decimal or four decimal place so you can use it over here and all currency name now this one will be in us dollar or maybe you want it to be an alternate currency in malaysian dollar or whichever other cur country currencies you want it to be an alternate currency now the decimal place is up to you to identify and the exchange rate is also up to your company's standard company's exchange rate and over here the you will also have this what you call the capital allowances whether you are allowing the capital allowance less initial amount or full amount so it's up to you to set the parameters over here now your full-year depreciation or prorated when we talk about full-year depreciation means you're taking a full-year depreciation to equal so that you will divide by twelve month your depreciation will be spread out equally okay for the twelve months let's said if one asset is twelve thousand so you use full-year you're spread out twelve thousand divide by twelve equals to one thousand per month that will be the depreciation amount now if you are taking a pro-rate it means it will pro-rate accordingly by the month so you will pro-rate for example by the date that you acquire starts okay you depreciate according to that date and you pro-rate accordingly by rounding up the amount that is to certain months so this is the method that you could identify over here in the parameters now spaces between labels is up to you to identify what type of labels you are actually using to print numeric the asset labels for your company and you also have the audit word and right over here you have the location of dos location of document custom now this location means a lot of people ask what is this location means now this location means you can actually default okay in the c drive or d drive accordingly or you can have it set a default into the a drive by putting this function in this odd manner and under this directory okay and the file name or whatever will be default in the a drive or c drive or d drive okay if you set it you set it this way and right over here let me take this out for you okay now right over here you can see that there are a number of colours for you to select two hundred and fifty-five colours so you can if you feel tired of any of the colours you want to play around with other colours you can just switch over with the help of this box colour here now right over here will be your set-up of the column paper width okay now if you are using a printer which is eighty column width then you identify as eighty okay if you are using a printer that is for printing of hundred and thirty-two column width paper you can override this eighty column to hundred and thirty-two column width so this will enables you to set accordingly to your company's printer configurations and it has this special condensed intelligence of the reports uh the modes for you for example if the reports exceed hundred and thirty-two which is for the eighty column width it come to hundred and thirty-two maximum now the system will condense the reports automatically for you without having you to set the kind of condense mode okay now if you save this parameter and you only do it once you don't want to come back and change and change again you only change it every beginning of the year and okay the next step you go is the update of codes now you may a codes for category the supplier code country subgroup location g\l account number and you may have cost centre number and let's go into one of this okay let me go into the category i'll show it to you now under this category code you may want to identify you may want to identify a certain code now this code is four limit to four alphanumeric code you can have e001 or something else that you like to call or ea01 or you can even identify this way all in alpha but it's four alphanumeric okay now from here the description is up to you to identify what you want to call fixed asset okay equipment you may call an equipment now the next one you may want to call something like ff which is fixtures and fitting okay and you may want to fix up this one as this description so let's save this one into the window so you will have what you call uh ff code and it's the description is considered as fixtures and fittings okay after this you may want to continue okay updating or creating the other codes now you don't have to get out of this windows all you need is just press and f five key which is the macro key to help you to select into the others build a supplier code and or go into a country okay to establish at the other codes for you okay let's say you want to build another country codes like uh malaysia so you just key in m one it can be alphanumeric also and you put malaysia okay so this one will enable you to carry on okay building doing all the other codes without having to to be out of this function now you can also go into cost centre and then start building your cost centre codes and descriptions so if you have completely okay set up the parameters for all this you can just come out of this function and go into the printing modes now you can print all this that you already actually set up the table codes okay and right here system passwords after having all this set up you can go into what you call a system password where you can just build a system password for a certain level of people  you can have master you can have the other stock levels so that only certain level of people can get assess to certain functions only 
Singapore	can you hear me  yes  alright i think we've lost some people here but no problem it's their loss uhm today really i would like to spend the next couple of minutes introducing to you ami pro the visual wordprocessor from lotus and i hope that after this you would be able to be challenged enough to come aboard with package and really be able to create impacting visually impacting docuhments to be able to communicate effectively maybe in your organization here uhm in the event that if my voice starts to change or you know things happen to my voice please excuse me because i've got a very bad cold at the moment so please bear with me uhm i wanna assure you that the package is exciting so it's not so trauhmatic to stay till you go for lunch alright okay so basically if i'll just sit here and i'll do the demo and talk at the same time you have seen 123 for windows windows applications before we start how many of you are using just dos wordprocessor as opposed to windows wordprocessor okay quite a nuhmber so what i'll do is that uhm because ami pro is really power-packed with features i can only i'll just show you some of these power-packed features but at the same time i will like to show you how easy it despite its power how easy it is to use just like uhm just mentioned earlier that it's rated its credibility is there as some of you who've updated to major industry journals it's been consistently rated as very easy to use and yet powerful wordprocessor but it runs on windows so basically i'll just show you a little bit as you know the menus over here are typical of every windows applications pull-down menus you call it but for this case you have under text you have bold and maybe a keyboard command if you're not used to the mouse which i'm using right now so this is quite typical of windows applications with its scroll bar at the side here and also it's dynamic dated right at the bottom here where you get information path or even if you don't have the time or watch has the time here now that's quite typical of wordprocessors the difference here you see is this smart icon which dave brought out earlier smart icons some people call it templates i call it short-cut keyboard uh or short-cut commands and over here it's typical of all lotus applications in that you see whatever you see here like printer or even right at the bottom here bold italic it's the same picture that you see in 123 for windows and freelance for windows and that is a plus point because the benefit's obvious you'll be so familiar with these icons when you go into 123 or freelance it's just a touch of your it's a click of your mouse alright i i wanna emphasize also like for here this icon over here where i would like to customize my i can move into tools customer micro user's setup for smart icons well i'll just click here for customization over here as you know i have a standard icons that depicts you can see the description here i use this to show the power-packed features of ami pro capitalized ruler thesaurus spell checker bookmarks etcetera etcetera i'll demonstrate some of these features later on there are altogether one hundred short cut keyboards for you to use so it depends it allows for flexibility if you are familiar with let's say you use spell checker all the time you wanna carry just pick it up and drag and put it into your current palate you don't want it pick it up and drag it back alright and if this is not sufficient if these hundred icons are not sufficient you can actually customize your icons by using the word  drawing package that ami pro supplies with or other packages so it's fine and i'll say i'll just move into it and like what uhm we've mentioned i won't touch on it top left bottom or floating i'll keep it as top okay so the screen here that now i'm going straight into the screen or your workspace you call it the views that we have for ami pro right now we're at the working view just click here we have full page standard enlarged and facing page when i mention just now about visual wordprocessor i will explain the benefits where we could actually when we go into full page mode here you can actually do complete editing here if you required as you can see unlike some windows applications that you know that they just go into preview and you can't touch it and you need to print over here you can actually format it as it looks on a full page that's the advantage and that's true wysiwig or true visual wordprocessor so that's why we position ami pro as a visual wordprocessor because what you see here is exactly what you print with no catch involved so if you are familiar with let's go back here uhm one of the key difference you notice here also is that if you are doing the traditional dos wordprocessor everything is just blank and a lot of guesswork involved so over here you actually see whatever it is including the whole page here the green sign here is actually the header and at the bottom over here it's right at the bottom will be the footer which you can also key in directly alright let me go through the process of showing how it is easy is to create let's say a new docuhment so you go file new ami pro actually has predesigned fifty five templates or style sheets we call it style sheets are actually templates that allows you it automatically formats for you your text and your docuhment so you might wanna choose maybe uh facts style sheet your contents or invoice or letter style sheet or memos the different memos here and even newsletters later on i'll show you some of the style sheets which are used for different docuhments so it's definitely quick and easy for you to get on board file new and choose the style sheet you're familiar with and just go on so for example here maybe i'll choose a fact style sheet i'll replace current file i don't know want i don't wanna save this dialog box here in the user's setup i've set it each time for to prompt me whether i wanna save or not well you can go into the user's setup and actually have an auto save so that you will not lose your file in case of any power uh you know off or things like that so what it does is now it load up a template and i've picked with contents so what it does is it actually gives you the templates that is within a frame and all you need to do is go in there and then start typing in alright this is just an example of a template or a a style sheet i don't want that i prefer something which i've customized just for this demo and i've named it lynn memo style which means if you don't want a pre-designed style sheet you can just use your own style sheet that are customized earlier and i say okay what it does now is that it've brought out a style sheet here and i've actually created a macro if some of you are familiar with macros and like to play around with it ami pro has a very powerful set and it's easy to use macro i've actually put in a macro so that straightaway in a power field it brings up the dialog box that asks me who do i want to type this to this is a my memo and i'll like to type it to let's say my boss which is uh casey leman sorry i've spelt wrongly alright and i say okay and it's straightaway the macro goes into next power field bit  word ask me sub subject then right now i'm talking about the annual report something and let's go down a little bit here so you notice over here this style sheet happens to have macros that enhances me i don't have to click here to type but if you don't have a macro you can easily just click here and type casey leman click here and type whatever if you notice over here at the bottom here there is this style sheet paragraph styles you call it each style sheet or each docuhment style you see will be accompanied with an assortment of paragraph styles which you can choose from body text or title header footer and this is predesigned with together the style sheets great word  i'll show you later you can actually add in your own paragraph styles and it's very easy so right now when i click over here you notice that it changed to regarding if i click over here it's to from word  so the cursor movement okay i move this one word cursor's missing uhm i'll like to apologize here because i've loaded a new mouse driver and it seems to be missing at this point of time so must have been loaded up here okay no problem word  okay no the cursor the mouse is there okay no problem i'm loading up ami pro again guess i was a bit enthusiastic i took it a new mouse driver you notice when it moves around it changes its size and uh i could have installed it wrongly okay it's loading up right now i'm using a 386 word machine right now on a lap laptop thirty-three megahertz and okay the cursors go here but file new let me go into it bear with me for a while and i'll go in again to my lynn okay this style sheet that's calling up like i mentioned its has macros so you go in again to casey leman so i'll just word alright and over here word  alright my cursor is now there okay this i've just touched this ami pro switch kit here i'll talk about it a little later on something which a little enhancements which i've loaded up okay so basically you notice when i click my cursor here it's under regarding if i click here automatically it tells you at the bottom here what it what paragraph style it is so if i enter here automatically you remember this paragraph setting but i can easily change it by clicking here to body text alright and as my typing is really slow what i'll do is i'm bringing some text under the paragraph format of body text and i put a macro here and it types in for me so that you guys won't fall asleep so body text changed now i will like to have bullet and instead of typing again i'm really slow so i do a macro here which invokes typing which i've done earlier before this memo and what i'll do is that uh bullet i'll go back to my text and draw a word  so basically you can see that my docuhment is complete but i'll like to maybe make some changes to formatting so what i'll do is that i can easily click into this maybe i need an indent here i'll click over here you can see there's a ruler here and once i click on it the tab ruler comes out so maybe i wanna hang in indent word  right now and i push it here you notice that you just fall through or if the tab ruler here over here i didn't make use of any tab but you can adjust and pull across the tab and you can see how easily or maybe you just throw it away  or if you wanna to do it you can put it back on again so this is what you call direct screen formatting or page formatting which is one of the enhancements of visual wordprocessor so the ruler here if you could on and off for me i'll like it on because i like to make use of it so again let's take a look how it looks in full page 
Singapore	this is the hdtv system and it is uhm eleven twenty five lines it's double of the ntsc system in in the in the world currently using today because uhm this has got double the resolution of that end  word  this is the uh ntsc laser disc player which gives the signal compar com comparable to this screen only these two can work together you see because for the first time kodak has has done a combined research and for the first time experimental uh film transferred through hdtv telecine normally film is transferred to uh tv as in broadcast video you see but that is that is on a pal system in singapore for instance six two five lines and that like commercials they usually film it on film and then after that they go through a post-production telecine how to transfer the film to video and that quality is only six two five lines but for the first time kodak is able to transfer film to hdtv through the hdtv telecine into hdtv format on the laser disc and this crisp quality of resolution that you see here is all generated on the film this particular one is shown on thirty-five mm film and some of the footages that you see are from either movies or from music videos that are shot in us and around the world and you can see the quality of the colour saturation there is a particular one which is very very good this one this is a music video you you you can watch the uh the quality the highlights the shadows and it's very very clear if ever any broadcasting uh stations in the world which switch over to hdtv maybe maybe japan or or uh in europe others will follow see like sbc they if they tend if they if they sort of like have the intention to go towards this direction maybe in ten years' time everybody would have to shoot on film to be able to get this quality and in fact as we are talking now a lot of people instead of shooting on video they are going back to shooting on film even if it's sixteen mm later on after this i'll show you footages of sixteen mm transfer and they are just as good look at the quality of the now i'll show you some footages which are transferred from sixteen mm film ya this is shown on sixteen mm blown up to thirty-five and transferred you can see the quality it's just as good at the moment it's the first time they did a film transfer direct it's it's possible in fact all the laser discs that you see they're all transferred directly from film to laser laser disc that's why you can see it you see currently oh no no no i mean not a lot of people does that but for the first time it's able to do a high definition laser disc you see from film transfer so that you see because right now nobody is broadcasting in this kind of signal so if if you do not have this player there will be no output you see so no we can't view anything because sbc word  broadcasting word frequencies and and they are on a system which is six two five lines pal and this is not not compatible to to n uh to hdtv standard which is twice of that you see so they for the first time we give you this film transfer to laser disc so that you can view it here to see the crisp quality of film transfer to hdtv  okay i represent singapore telecom international which markets a service a data communication service called infonet and infonet is an ex twenty five package switching network which operates on the ex twenty five protocol now a protocol is actually a pathway so to speak which transports data from one end to another in other words if you are in singapore and you would like to communicate with someone in los angeles in the states for instance you would use your computer type it on a software have it saved and transmitted to a mail box and it resides there till the other party in the united states decides to retrieve it now alternatively we have got another service which calls which is called a list line kind of service which simply means that you are connected directly to your user on the other end which wherever it may be around the world and it is transmitted real time immediately in other words you are connected directly like you're making a phone call and it is your data is transmitted directly now it really depends on what the customer requires if the customer requires a service which uh is affected by time differential in other words if you're speaking to london and there's a seven and a half hour difference you would want to ensure that your message is retrieved received by your counterpart in the united kingdom so what you would do is you would subscribe to electronic mail service which essentially means you have you would have an ibm compatible pc and buy the software from us the software would would then be like a postbox where you store your information as in a word processing software much like wordperfect wordstar and nuh put into the network now once it is in the network your user on the other end could just use the similar the same kind of software that you have in singapore dial up into the system and retrieve the information now it sounds pretty technical because i really don't have my uh slides at the moment but uh basically it's an electronic mail mail postman imagine that uh on this end you would like to post a letter what you do then is to go to the postbox put it into the postbox the postman comes and collects it puts it into his truck drives it to the post office where it's sorted and sent to the various districts now once it has reached the various districts it would then be delivered to the households that have have uh been it has been the letters have been addressed to now this is similar but in an our service is similar to this principle except that it is electronically done what we do is that instead of the postman we have the software and the software is connected to a modem which is connected to a telephone line now what you do is you type your information onto the software save it it is then transferred by the modem to the telephone line to the network now in the network that would be your post office your general post office where the information is collated and distributed in other words it is sorted and sent to the people that you are addressing it to now when your parties on the other end decide to take the letters from the post office like a po box they tap into the the network and re and basically get the information from them which means that they get the letter so that is uh basically how an electronic mail service works much like a conventional post office system except that you don't see it it is it works through electricity and and what have you the electronic gadgetry that's available in high technology at this point in time is there anything else that i could uh interest you in beside uh the electronic mail service  uhm okay uh i'll teach you how to uh go go back to the uh yes to lock out uh lock out type l o g o u t okay uhm you have to choose unix to f t p to leonis alright ya because you have to load the file from the p c to the to the uh to leonis do i have any files inside i will i will try to f t p some of the files on hard disk f t p means file transfer protocol or file transfer ya file transfer protocol protocol meaning uh a kind of language lah a language so user i d for logging on to leonis you have to log on to the host first which is uh c c e p y f for me and then password i'm trying to transfer some of the files to the uh leonis leonis is the greek name for lion okay we are actually logged in already okay uhm there are a few commands that you need to remember one is uh okay you must be sure what kind of files you are transferring firstly uhm firstly is it a binary file or ascii file uh let's say if you it's a text file text you don't have to specify anything right what you need to do is uh just uh do a v r r and see if your files are there uh sorry this is uh leonis host directory uh local directory l d i r list local local directory this is my h drive what how you change how to change to how to change it to b uh a sorry to change it to a what you should do is uh you you type drive change local drive to a okay that's how you change if you don't want to change also can what you should what you need to do is that you just put a put a uhm something something you must specify the path lah you know what i mean but uh if you want to leave the directory you have to change it okay to see if your a your files is inside diskette before you do any transfer okay uh fail found okay there are two commands one is to put one is to get because your f t p from your nusnet right that means your f t p from p c to f t p for p c means you want to uh put a file into leonis that is called putting so you put put put a colon file name file name extension alright if you are already in a colon now you already a colon you have to you don't have to put a colon  question  if you don't specify file name default file name same same as the uh when it's being transfer over to leonis you'll be you will have the same file extension okay but uh you hit double enter means default file name same okay uh not reading because no file there now what i want to do is uh i will try a file on my h drive which i have you see okay say i try a very small file say uhm uhm no no my confi is not here i will try say three zero three message i hope is a small one alright i put three zero three to leonis oh dear i must try to change back uh forgot try to change back to to h okay put uhm three zero three dot sign s two that's why i can't teach too much because some people may not be able to absorb everything too complicated for them transfer successful  question  i do a d i r i see the file there there three zero three it's transferred on november the tenth this is how i did  question  i'm already in leonis actually but you cannot do pie  word  here you have to log on to leonis again uh i choose default right so it's the same file name three zero three m s d it needs a bit of practice the the booklet i'm sure they list it i'm showing you ya some of the more complicated too brief ya that's why you have to uh you see some demonstration here 
Singapore	good afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome to our wordstar for windows launch uhm today we'll be presenting to you the first ever recipient of pc user gold award winner which is of a word itself window and today's programme will also include a slide presentation by mr michael wee followed by a highlight of today's program a demonstration of wordstar for windows by ms irene khoo irene will also show you the correct grammar and the bitstream base lift which is also binded in our program after the coffee break we will have a round of lucky draw and several announcements so without further ado i'll like to call upon mr michael wee regional sales manager of wordstar asia to introduce wordstar for windows to you michael please don't please don't stop hi uh it's good to see all of you and it's very reassuring to know that the name wordstar can still draw this type of interest uh i know that's partly also due to the windows environment but i'm very very sure that most of you are here because of wordstar right say yes louder yes well we'll try again later afterwards alright you know many many years ago uh wordstar was the number one in the pc environment where wordprocessing is concerned and if i'm not wrong most of you if not all of you started using wordstar for the word-processing yes see i told you it's getting better good but then somewhere along the way uh we admit we slacken a little bit and thereby we let a lot of other competitors came into the picture they caught up with us and they have also to a certain extent overtaken us so much so that whenever now people are looking into word-processing perhaps one of the questions they will ask is why wordstar and not something else unlike before where is why something else and not the wordstar well for the first part of the presentation i'm going to show you why you should consider or reconsider wordstar because we have gone through a lot of changes so much so that we we're able to get our windows product out in time long before our competitor that is our main competitor i don't like to mention names here but uh i believe you know uh which one i'm referring to okay alright is it a bit too is it a bit too dark nuh okay okay alright because i've got to be able to see my script otherwise i'll won't be able to say what i'm supposed to say alright don't worry okay now despite the lapse uh that wordstar has fallen into we are actually still the number two wordprocessing company in terms of the number of units shipped alright we are the number two word-processor for dos units shipped it may surprise a lot of you but this is true uh okay just just before i carry on can those people at the back hear me oh you can hear me but you can't see me is it this light here okay can we have this lights it's much better now can you still see me but i have a problem here because now i can't see my script but that's alright we'd i'll just carry on from here uh we have sold over five million copies we have a strong brand name recognition and i think no one here will dispute that because even though many of you may have been using other word-processing software you will still know the name wordstar we have a proven distribution engine which i will show you because we have a very wide um distributor network that covers a lot of the countries we are the nineteenth largest pc software companies in states uh we employ about slightly less than 280 employees our last year revenue was thirty-five million alright we take a look at this graph you'll find that wordstar is number two in terms of its dos units shipped uh the first one of course you can see for yourself i won't tell you too much about that right we have overseas office in all these countries that you see here very few very few software companies do have this kind of coverage as we do they they do have distributors all over the world like like we do but they do not have the subsidiaries in this country the reason why we have set up subsidiaries in all these countries is because we realize we have to get close to the consumer we have to get close to people like in order to react faster to the market changes in order to know what you people want us to do and thereby come up with something better so this is a very different wordstar you are looking at now and what actually is different in wordstar well first of all we've now got a new leadership new management team uh if you are familiar or you're aware with the software industry in the states mr ron posner has now joined us as ceo mr posner has a very impressive track record in ashtontate in symantech now uh ye when he was there the companies have managed to triple or quadruple their earnings during his tenure in the companies there uh we've got a new product strategy of which you'll be seeing this this afternoon we've also focussed on very aggressive marketing we've done a lot of very aggressive funding agreement i'm sure you know about it in the past and this new management team has taken a different approach what mr ron posner is looking at is into software companies that he can buy that will be complementary to the wordstar hah i didn't know that thanks okay uh complementary products into the wordstar wordprocessing environment then we've now also because of this new management team we've managed to create a a new company image now product pres product strategy is to build wordprocessing into document management document management basically covers a wider arena of uh what wordprocessing is all about document management you'll be talking about desktop publishing you'll be talking about microfilms you'll be talking about laser worms and all these kind of things so we're building wordprocessing into this document management and in the near future you'll be seeing more products towards this aspect of course we'll keep upgrading our dos product dos at this present time remains a very important market to us even though windows as we all know is getting very popular but in terms of the number of installed units dos by far outskips windows still  you can and you need to access your uh head office information right you need your head office information at your fingertip all you need is one-touch tone telephone you make one phone call you can access your phone messages you can send phone messages your electronic mail right your computer mail can read to you over the phone we're talking about text-voice conversion it means it's like your sec your secretary reading the mail to you saying mr manager you know this is your letter blah blah blah blah everything dollars and cent how many thousand dollars how many cents you know the address and stuff like that it's very fast  customer: so uh what kind of e-mail system that it can able to what kind of computer do you have  let's say bayan buy or novell bayang or novell  uh is that ibm compatible without a pc it's a pcc uh it's ibm compatible i believe bayang word is ibm compatible yes uh it connects to ibm computer hp deck word  unisyss word  honeywell ncr a lot of computers eight or nine okay so so the electronic mail right it can read to you over the phone if you do not want it to read to you you want it in hard copy right that means on paper right you can tell the system send my electronic mail all my fax to the nearest fax machine that's closest to me say for example you're flying on a plane and there is a fax machine on the plane you can tell the system send my electronic mail and the fax to the fax machine on the plane itself so all you have to do is just walk up to the aisle from the to the  word fax machine just put there on the plane itself you can do all that anywhere in the world as long as you have a touch-tone telephone you can access all those information so the versatile versatility lies in the fact that your elec your computer mail computer uh fax can be converted into voice or into fax anywhere in the world  so uh to make up this system what what are the minimum uh software  okay you you need to buy this product called word  the computer is right over there you see the black box over there it says centigram voice-processing system you need to buy one of the box that's it  so this this system is a pc-based system or a  the box is some sort of computer a very specialized computer may have your own uh telephone word to uh sort of  you have a pbx in your office  yep ya we have must we connect to the pbx  sure if you it word connects to the pbx then you integrate everything because pbx is connected to the fax machine right vyour fax machine is connected to the pbx  but those whom without a pbx they cannot do all these  key telephone system also can best is pbx but key telephone system also can but very basic so this is very versatile very powerful  okay thank you  most welcome  bk can you show me this  okay this is based on uh this is using your word  technology okay say for example uhm you your ceo is on the tenth floor and you're on the fifth floor and your ceo wants to talk to you so the on your ceo computer there's a box down here that says voice and it has your phone number on it the ceo takes this pen uh light-pen and hit that box the computer will dial your extension and then you say yes mr ceo what can i do for you okay maybe he will say i want to talk to you about last month's sales progress okay so on uh your ceo will pull out a document from his pc on the screen right the same document will appear on your screen also so both of you are watching the same document and while you're having a voice-communica cation through the phone right that means a speaker phone you talk to him right at the same time you say yes mr ceo i i'm i think uh maybe you're looking at this figure at the same time you can see this is it so the thing is this is not restricted to just within the building you can it it can be done uhm different countries say you're in singapore ceo is in new york city okay he'll call you up it's as though like he's just next to you you don't have to fly from singapore to new york city and this is very cheap you don't have to buy pc and whatever it is uh you already have pc already right uh ibm compatible pc and ps2 or or ps ps2 there's a few cards you just slot inside it runs word  loads some software inside that is it  c2: it's sort of special monitor  it's not that's a normal printer all you need is the product is actually only a few cards and some software  c2: what are the cards that you  uhm it's it's it's inside uh  c2 is it in the brochure they gave us at the front  no there's no brochure for this we're we're just marketing this product we're not sellers we we just want to okay we want to introduce this product to all to the public let people know that this product is available see the the reason is isdn is too expensive for most people too expensive and because it's too expensive nobody wants to use it and because nobody want very few people want to use it problem correct so right now if you tell everybody and we have and we find out that there's a large demand for this then we can immediately lower down the isdn offer  this word technique uh so we're actually quite word c2: what is this product called uh it's called uh isdn information integrator c2: from which company it's uh joint-venture between an american company and british c2: not launched yet not launched yet this one is also not launched it's making its debut but uhm it will help uh it will be launched in a few months' time have i explained to you uh this one bk: no okay say for example you're an executive on the move right and you word you need some information from your head office at your fingertips and all you need is one touch of telephone you make one phone-call can access your phone messages you can send phone messages these are just some some of the crazy word there are some more much much more inside if i just want word  electronic mail it can read to you your electronic mail to you over the phone that means it's converting from text to word and or you can send uhm you can send your e-mail or your faxes to any fax machine that's nearest to you say like you're on you're on a plane there's a fax machine on the plane you can tell the system send the e-mail and the fax to you on the plane itself so very very powerful and it makes use of existing facilities just like existing facilities you need a few cards right so it make use of existing phone system computer system and a fax machine you already all have these in the office already right now the problem is they are not integrated they are not talking to each other they are all isolated so if you buy this uh product it integrates all these together so your this electronic mail can be converted into voice or converted into text anywhere in the world you have a touch-tone telephone can be accessed all these it's very very powerful bk: so this is the phone any phone bk: oh any phone you don't need a special phone a touch-tone telephone that's all bk: thank you welcome 
Singapore	okay welcome to all of you ah today i will exaggerate more on the pc side because now pc ah become more and more popular so of course word and we hope in singapore ah have a pc right so we will consider more of this so introduction to the computer okay now to a computer i can see here this is computer right so this is not black box is a white box now for all those laymen not technical incline actually it's just a magic black box you put something in and something will come out right you you press one key the picture will come out see i i press a key here then another picture will come out right it look very impressive word just like magicians okay so actually computer ah break down convert round the cpu that's the most important thing that is comparable to our brain so so that is computer brain it's a cpu and maybe consist of what you call alu is arithmetic and logic unit that means it can do arithmetics and it can do some low level logically word logical decision-making okay then word controller controller just like a traffic-controller so if you want to read something from somewhere the controller will advise the computer what to do so if you want to read from floppy-disk it will read from floppy-disk if you want to write to something some device it will write to some other device whenever to show onto the screen it will show on the screen so controller will do all the controlling now then the computer need what you call memory so when you go and buy a computer for example if you ask how much memory you have right so the basic configuration for example for eighty and 386 machine for example the basic one will come up with about six hundred forty k but some will come with one meg or even two meg or four meg but whatever increase in the memory you'll have to pay for it it's not free right now so we've the internal memory the function of the controller is to retrive and store data  word from the storing devise by storage devise for example here this one we have quite a number of storage devises inside here we got hard disk in here we have a floppy-disk in here so this is a storage devise so the controller will control all these things and it will communicate between input and output devise so this one is output devise these two the keyboard and the mouse is input device okay so it will control all the these function and it will communicate between the alu and memory for example computer need to do some calculations they need information the information is stored in the memory so the job of coordinating all these effort is done by alu and controller okay then you can execute instructions written in a programme so computer will do a very fantastic job but one at a time now computer unlike human being word  my personal opinion computer can never replace human being because no doubt we talk about computer intelligent artificial intelligent but actually all those intelligent are human intelligent human put into the programmes so they become process of certain degree of intelligent but it's all from human so without man the computer cannot work right then the control of operation of alu do all the arithmetic function do logi logical decision-making so the function of ale occurs as the name imply it do arithmetic operations it perform logical operation for example by logical operation means what suppose you are calculating say sales commission for example so if you make monthly sales below five thousand no sales commission so it's zero right so your commission will be zero but if you make monthly sales between five thousand to ten thousand commission will be 2% of the total sales for example then if your sales is for ten thousand to twenty commission will be 4% and so on so the computer can make some logical decision-making so suppose it make the sales for certain sales executive now it will know how to calculate the sales commission if the sales' below five thousand the commission for that month will be zero okay if the sales is between five thousand and ten thousand computer are smart enough they will take the total number of sales times 2% and then add this one to your commission and so on so that is what you call logic operations then the memory sometime you call this memory right so you if there is time the computer programmes and then now  word it store now computer actually is just a tool of course it's more uh what you call attractive and also more what should be more flexible than just a knife for example but in terms of utility it's just like a tool okay computer is a tool to help us to carry out our job more efficiently in a more productive way so computer is a tool now how can a computer work without cannot work suppose computer you buy a computer and you pay for say for example two thousand for a computer you take it home you turn it on you'll word not going to work because like if you don't pay for the software it doesn't work it's just mere piece of hardware sit there and computer have a lot of patience if you don't tell the computer to do the cursor just hang on on the screen that's all and it keep waiting to receive your instruction before you make the first move so all the computer do it so fantastic right is because of software now you watch for what you call science fictions programme lah i mean in tv right so certain agent want to know other agent's information press one button all biodatas everything come out right now the computer cannot do that all that is done by software and also done by human being that means in order to get all those information you must have the information first so you may send twenty agents to get all the information then you need another number of peoples okay to key in all those information and you need to have a software to retrieve all information and show it on the screen to you right so all these software programmes are stored in the memory now computer need to communicate with outside peripherals for example you have input device for example the standard input device is what you call keyboard okay and we have a mouse like that and nowadays you have a new one call n system now if you don't want to key in you can just write you'll  word understand what you write okay so that is input device then you have some output devices this one is output device it's a standard one word so whatever you want to read come to here another device for example printer you can print it out we'll cover the devices so all these function will go through the cpu cpu will do all the job right print something you want okay just like your mother wants to cook certain dishes go to the market to buy all the ingredients so ingredient is the input side and ingredient put in the input device then the cpu that means already get the instruction how to cook say for example sweet and sour pork for example so with all our ingredient prepare then every single step will work to carry out to cook sweet and sour pork word right so output device will store your what dish we have some auxillary storage for example you may have some other thick word  drive you may have for example okay multi-media you may have cd-rom everything you can  word to have all these all went through the cpu now computer is a tool so what are the major characteristic of the computer high-speed for example take for example you want to look for some information which  word on file then you see manually you go to the cabinet look for the file keep flipping you still could find the information right right for computer system if you have a good database all i need to do is key in the key words press a button you will immediately give off the information from the devise okay so for example nowaday you have an encyclopedia all on cd-rom so you can check all the reference ah articles by keying some of the key-words you can immediately get the information out whereas for manual system you have all volumes of encyclopedia that now you must know which volume to take out then you have to go to the index to check which page to look  word from now computer can do this in much much higher speed okay then it can systematically store and retrieve vast volume of datas for example the bank auto-teller right you just if you put your card into the ah auto-teller machine right then you just key in your what pin-number and then you key in what you want to get out all these in a few seconds' time you can get your money from the bank already right why because the bank already systematically store the information in there now how much you've balance in there so suppose you have only five hundred inside you key in eight hundred it just simply say you have you have insufficient fund right please take back your card suppose word  all the information is there so you can systematically store and retrieve randomly all the information you can automatically execute instruction now the first generation of computer is very terrible it's all hard wire so they have to wire up wire up right to do one operation they have to re-wire change another operation they have to re-wire all over again so make that make the computer very unfriendly very hard to use only those very few technical people know how to operate computers okay but now the computer today is totally different it's very friendly all you need to do is just to the programme in store on any device then it can read from the device go into the memory and it just carry out the instruction from the main menu so it automatically carry out then it'll process logical capability i already explain to you and it is accurate computer unless a computer go haywire okay it is more accurate than you can expect for example the computer will store up to fourteen decimals in there okay right as you've seen calculators sometime you have to do some rounding and so if you have so many intermediate step the end result maybe  word rounding will cause you the first digit right difference okay but computer is maintain full accuracy up to fourteen digit inside and is reliable reliability if the programme of course if the programme is wrong then of course you couldn't rely on the computer to give you the result but if the programme is correct the logic is correct then you key in the information it can always reproduce it can reproduce the same result over and over again so ten persons key in the same thing running the same programme will get the same result you won't get different result okay so that is reliable so how does computer solve the problem as we mentioned in software right so for the computer software mainly is in two area one is system software the other one is what you call application software now system software consist of control programme and service programme now control programme will do all the necessary complication between all the devices and between the memory so if you want to open a data file say my grandparents they will go to the appropriate device read the file out okay so all these is done by control programme  all the input output side then you have some call service programme now every now and then you need to copy file you need to backup file for example you need to do purge purge all the file all these is come uh under what you call service programme right 
Singapore	now what you see here is the workplace shelf okay uhm these are icons okay what you see here are icon you can move them around using your mouse buttons okay you can uhm drag them and reposition them and things like the a shape like this meant uh folders this is quite the same as windows three dot x kind of uhm uh interface where you click and it open uh it's a folder or mackintosh okay now i show you what are the differences okay let me find a scratch disk okay now for example i want to access uh my drive a the diskette that i've just stuck in okay what normally i can do is i go to the command prompt and say a and let maybe fall back but in in this kind of an object oriented workplace shelf what i can do is i open the drive folder and you can see that these are all the drive i have i have a drive b drive is my uh tape word i have in my hard disk c d e f partition and i have a c r rom attached on this this system so for exmaple like i want to okay this shows what i have in the a drive disk it's blank now for example like i want to format the disk i can just click on the icon and i got the pop up menu okay i can just press and clicks and say format okay and it give me what are the various uh capacity i i'll like to format okay then i just click format it'll go formatting now let's look at the other uhm stuff we have on the desk top okay we have things like a shredder here okay which you can creates uh objects i mean you you can delete an object for example uhm i want trash away this file called tic-tak-toe i can just drag and drop on the shredder and guess what delete right this is quite similar to mackintosh anyone is a mackintosh user over there ya it looks like mackintosh right you drag it to the i think mackintosh is trash trash can okay so this is delete and let let's look at the dos uhm folder here which i have all this dull dos icon here what do i do if let's say if i want to change an icon okay it's also object oriented right i just have to click the setting notebook for this icon and if this is lotus and i want to use this icon for it i can just drag this and i drop on the current icon box here and guess what this icon is changed okay so it's this kind of thing you don't have to issue command say change icon or you don't have to go to the top bar there and pull down your selection ah select icon change this kind of thing so it's object oriented in this aspects and for example like uhm changing the colour of your uh system object for example like i want to go to the background okay uh i go to the system setup what i need to do is i just open the colour palate the colours are  word also object what i have to do is just drag the colour and drop onto the place where i want to change you can see that the colours change pretty nicely okay and to activate programme is just by double clicking of the of the icon and you'll see that while i was doing all those the formatting is done in the background this is what i meant by multitasking and it's done and for example i want to save a file onto drive b what do i do i can just drag and drop on it for example this file type a i'll drag and can see that i think the a drive should be blinking right it's not sorry or i'll choose another file anyway uhm how about word  ya if if in case for any reason why i can't move this file you'll see that the no entry sign is there okay not to worry let me copy something from my e drive uhm let me  word save file does not use the text file that means i can copy can drag over drag you know hopefully i think it's there it's there right i think so so to show that it's there okay the convix save file is there so but anyway if for any doser  word common command prompt user would like to use command prompt die-hard those of you without without seeing the command prompt  word there's also o s two command prompt you can use okay and from this command prompt you can always uh set for this is the o s two command prompt and you can open up a dos file by just saying well then you can go to a dos environment okay i'll show more of this later okay uhm like for example like the drive folders i open up you can also see that it's in a tree form and this the sub-directories are all organise in folders also okay so it is object oriented in this ex aspect now what i want to show you next is uhm compatiblity of uhm dos and window i'l i'll have you got a very clear i mean at least a clear idea of what workplace shelf it's this shell this moving of icon this creating of icon deleting by dragging pulling word dropping this is what i meant easy to use or the or the workplace shell okay the next topic that i want to go through is the compatibility of uhm dos okay for i can run things like word perfect for dos okay and i can put them into the background alright this is dos word perfect running in one window and i can run lotus one two three and i can put this also in the window form put them side by side okay now by a by being able to run my dos applications side by side onto on on the desk on the o s two desk top what does it buy me as a user okay in the dos environment or in the simple dos dos environment single tasking even uhm what you can do let's say you want to copy all this sales uhm figures all this figures onto a word processor file what you can do is you can only convert them to a file and then export them in word perfect you have to read those text file in right but let's say if you run can run them on the desk top side by side you can do simple things like cut and paste right and it hand word  enhance the capability of your dos applications it's not only the dos application you can do cut and paste uhm in our office i'm using the comms manager two okay uhm i'm able to you see now in the in the host environment let's say if i want to reply to a mail somebody send me a mail okay it's in fax form i want to reply to the mail and i i like to do some quoting so normaly if if i don't don't have o s two cut and paste facility what i have to do is i have to copy that mail into a file then i open up the file i use the text editor to add those arrow by the side then i close that file i have to evoke that mail and call that file in and then i send that file okay now in in the host i mean if running on o s two what i can do is i just lift word up that portion of text mark it up in my incoming mail okay it'll click and go into my o s two clip board then i just have to key into i mean uh respond then you have have another fresh uhm mailer screen to come up then i say paste paste onto the same box okay in that in that case i can do a lot of manipulation and that would add to my capability of my using my prompt my i b m prompt i don't know whether this will give you a good idea or not because i think in n u s you just use prompt right bitnet yah for today's set up here you can see the two machine actually we're trying to do some networking in this room but it was not really successful so we can't do that uh therefore i just mention this okay okay cut and paste uh well this is just between the dos applications now what i'm going to show is uhm sharing of datas uhm between o s two and windows applications with this i would like to show that o s two can run windows and of course it can also share the windows application data with whatever application that it is running on windows platform okay so i'll like to run excel here this is microsoft excel now in o s two point o when i run excel i probably would have to run it in the full screen mode that means uhm i have to go into the uh windows win dot com and you'll see whole whole page of window but this application now is running what i call seamlessly on the o s two desk top okay this within this box that you see here is all the windows kind of uh interface the minimise icon into this manner okay now let's look at an o s two spreadsheet which is the lotus one two three by the way the lotus one two three release two that this one i'm running is the thirty-two bit application and i'll touch on the benefits of using thrity-two bit applications where recently there was an article in the business times i wonder if anyone read uh in thirty-two bit we trust or something like that written by lim sin sin now this this two spreadsheet is running side by side let me enter some figure onto this uh excel side just some simple number let me block it up and say copy then i edit and i paste link over this side what i'm trying to do here is uh is d d e link okay uhm does anybody know what's d ding d d e link in the windows environment there is this called this link called dynamic data exchange link okay you're able to share data dynamically uhm between two applications and if you change one the other one should change okay normally what you see happens is between two windows applications now i'm showing you is one on windows the other one is on o s two applications and d d e does work okay now i want to change uhm for example this okay and you see that side is eight perhaps the numbers you can't see properly maybe i put it into a chart okay this is uh o s two lotus one two three's chart then i choose this one uh do i have a three d one here is a three-d one and can see much better okay so you can see that the d d e link data is almost instanteous update okay i'll just like to explain a bit how this is being done so that you can appreciate that this is not actually as simple as what you see although you can see that the update is quite fast first when you do the d d e okay the data has to go into a clipboard and that went into the win o s two clipboard first okay that's the windows clipboard maintained by o s two  now from there when i do a paste paste link over to a a o s twos application there's another clipboard is being call up and it's active in the background and we can't see that is the o s two clipboard and information is passed from uhm the excel into the clipboard in o s via word  o s two and passed transferably to o s two's clipboard and goes out to lotus one two three's clipboard and all this passing around is transparent to the user and let alone when you save there's a change in value all these changes will be go through with this manner okay 
Singapore	good morning everybody it's nice to see so many people here today i guess when i see so many people here it makes me feel happy because today what i really aim to do was is to introduce a new hobby to you but let me start by telling you that i won't be teaching you or demonstrating to you how to paint aircraft and military vehicles what i'm interested to do here is to show you how are we going to paint models or figures and if you look at my showcase over here you'll see figurines of all sorts ranging from aliens predators batman the crow and all sorts of figures in fact even star wars figures if you noticed what i aim to do really is to introduce this new hobby to all of you because it's a hobby that i hold very dearly to my heart since i was very young i've always liked toys that allow me to use my imagination and creativity to construct them that's why i enjoyed playing with lego and stuff like that but as i grew older i realised i want to do more with my hands and my imagination and i started i started painting airfix model-kits seeing that smiles on your faces i know some of you did that too and then later on as i watched movies and grow into like popular figures and all i realised that hey maybe i can paint these figures and just let me tell you that at the end of the day when you finished painting a figure you look at it you'll feel extremely happy and a sense of gratification it's extreme and it's wonderful because you have a work of creation in your own hands and today that's what i'm going to teach you but i also want to warn you that it may sound very nice if you look at the showcases and all the works that you see there but a lot of people would give up at the beginning stage so i wonder how many how many of you here will go on to paint an actual figure but we will see we will see don't worry about this and we will see the objectives of this demonstration is to first of all we will learn i will show you how to prepare a figure to be painted and you'll be surprised to know that sometimes that alone takes up more time than the painting process itself number two we will learn how to paint a figure of course right that's why all of you are here we will learn techniques like wet brushing dry brushing techniques of painting the eyes and other difficult parts of the body and even even learning how to use the airbrush then thirdly i'm going to show you how to improvise how to make your model your painted model more exciting more alive by improvising ready any questions good if you have no questions let's go on to my first objective here is to teach and to demonstrate to you how to prepare a model for painting first of all the materials in your course if to need you will need paints paints i will suggest uhm you use tamiya paints or the testor paints these are special paints that you use to paint models next brushes brushes can be bought anywhere but you would need all sorts of brushes you need the very thick ones like here let me show you and the very very fine ones and these fine ones are use for painting very difficult to reach areas like the eyes little crevices places like that which we'll show you later now before you can even use the brush and the paint aha you are going to need this a putty knife this is a cutting tool that is very very sharp there was once when i was trying to cut off cut off some excess areas from a figure and i wasn't careful and i sliced through quite a big piece of my finger off yah and it's still there now but uhm but it's a grim reminder of the pain i suffered during then so you have to be very very careful when you use this cutting knife but it's an essential equipment that you need next here we have the putty this putty this white stuff over here is very important because it's used to fill up those spaces uhm let me explain this in another way when a model-kit is given to you it never comes in a complete it's never fully assembled so you have to cut off all the excess pieces and assemble them together now when you assemble them together using the super glue usually the pieces will not fit snugly or nicely to each other so what you need to do is to use the putty put it against the area that is connecting the two parts smoothen it up by using water and so on and then it'll look complete itself so this is what a putty is used for okay and then we have this interesting powder here it's actually a cement model cement we use this cement sometimes to improvise to make bases and sometimes we use it even to fill up the figures all the figures that you see they are hollow on the inside because they are made of vinyl so they are hollow on the inside vinyl would also mean that they are plastic so they can be molded in a way so if you want your figure to have weight and to retain the shape forever you'll need to fill up first of all the figures with cement when this cement dries up the figure will now have retained its own shape and it's fully constructed it gives the figure a certain weight and it feels it's actually better right any questions at this point with all the equipment good now this equipment here is called the airbrush it's a very expensive equipment uh usually costing about about two three hundreds if you include the that compressor here which is the more expensive equipment airbrush comes in different grades sometimes they be very cheap about five six dollars but will never last a lifetime what i have here is the testor brush which is fully guaranteed and it's very good well if you start this new hobby of yours you don not need to buy the airbrush at the present moment what you can do is that you can use the equipment over here i'll usually rent it out at a very cheap rate of five dollars per hour so if you have any questions you can even ask me during the painting process so you don't need to buy this equipment at home unless you feel a need to any questions alright let's begin first thing how do you prepare your figure for painting let me show you in this packet here we have a figure of dr death from judge dread this is the figure usually i show uhm to new students on how to paint a figure as you can see the figure when it comes to you they are in different pieces two legs the body the head and the two hands over here and you have a base over here so the first thing you've to do is to shape is to cut away the excess plastic of the vinyl that you see around the figures especially at the ends that need to be connected so let me show you how it's being cut notice how careful i am to hold the place hold the place hold the figure at right parts and be careful of the knife and not shave off excess not shave off too deeply into the figure itself and especially not to cut your hands and your fingers right after we do this the next you'll have to do is that you have to remember this is to put all these pieces into a basin and you wash them with detergent or soap now you may ask why do we need to do this the reason is because when when the model is still being is being in the factory it contains certain chemicals which is on the surface of the of the figurines now if you if you paint this figure without removing all these chemicals you will notice that about a few months down the road the figures will start to erode the paint will start to fall off and of course nobody would want that so the very first thing you need to do is to wash them thoroughly and then thorough and then dry them thoroughly with a dry cloth you may need to use the hot air blower to dry them up if you need okay once the pieces are been cut and washed and dried now we connect them together for this process you will need the super glue let me show you by connecting this hand to the body put the super glue at the right places now we attach the hand snugly together and hold it there for five seconds good now it's all done but if you look at the hands and the body between the two areas where they are connected you realised that hey there are places that show that it is a model-kit because there are holes there are certain crevices that are not been filled up nicely this is unavoidable now to remove these holes and crevices what we do now is to use the putty let me show you this putty looks like a plasticine and it can be molded we take a sharp object like a toothpick now take an amount of putty that is needed put it into the hole like this try to squash the putty around the edges until it's very nice good now we use a cotton bud dip it into water and now i put the cotton bud against the area that need to be smoothen out because you notice the putty spreads out everywhere and it's not smooth now you keep putting the cotton bud around the area and smooth out all the whole area let it dry for a few minutes and now if you take a look at it you don't see the crevices anymore and it looks as if the model actually came with the hand and the body connected isn't it good now i'm not going to show you how to do the rest but i have now an assembled dr death which i assembled earlier this model now if you look at it has been fully assembled fully puttied everything is smooth right now you think starts the painting process not yet the very first thing we need to do now is to first of all spray-paint the whole model-kit with a first coat now very important this first coat must be of a neutral colour so i suggest you either use white or grey because these colours are not dark enough to be evident at the end of the painting process so let me spray-paint it using the grey colour this spray-paint you can get it anywhere in any shops uhm department stores for about nine or eight dollars per can but use sparingly let me demonstrate how do i actually spray-paint this figure you will notice that i do not put the nozzle very very close to the figure to be painted i usually put about one and a half feet away from the figure and i spray-paint it very evenly and very thinly across the whole figure by putting it very closely you're your spray-paint will be too thick on the figure and what this would do is that it would remove all the intricacies and all the nooks and crevices on the figures  and all the surface parts will be all gone will be all covered by this thick paint and we do not want that because we still want all these surfaces to be there after the first coat it's very important and this is how you do it so just a very thin layer would do 
Singapore	let me open up an application and i'll explain parts of a window we've got a bit more hands-on later on your note pad is a windows application there's accessory in-built in your windows three one okay let me go back to your page ten notes mouse pointer okay what do you see this is your mouse pointer that is mouse pointer but when you move your mouse pointer into the note pad window it changes into a what you call a pin that's when you click to change your insertion point from one location to another that's your insertion point the insertion point is the point that which whatever you type in your keyboard it will be reflected there okay so if you go use your mouse pointer to click anywhere that you want your your uh insertion point to go okay let's go to another one control menu box you see on the top left-hand corner of your note pad window this is your control menu box when you click once on it it display the menu move size minimise maximise close switch tools all these commands you could make do without using them here you could make use of these commands by using the mouse and doing it with the mouse rather than selecting the commands from your control menu box the only time when you think you need to use the control menu box is when you want to exit from the application okay later i'll teach you how to exit from note pad one of the fastest ways it to double click on the control menu box that's when you exit note pad okay this is your control menu box i'll teach you how to move size minimise maximise the window later on let's go to the third one title bar window title this is your title bar okay the one that is labelled in blue colour the active one is always in blue programme manager is now running at the background programme manager here this is the title bar for programme manager this is the title bar for note pad which ever one is whichever is the one that's active in the foreground will be labelled blue the other one will be transparent but it's up to you to define your colour that you want at desktop it's up to you but default it's blue okay this is your title this is your title bar with your window title so notepad defines this window as an application window for notepad okay menu bar this is your menu bar you see file exit search help this is common uhm uhm the best part of all the commands are common between windows applications you don't find just menu bar in the non windows application okay you could only find this in any windows application what happens is you could click on any of the words any part of those words there to draw down the menu for file you have one menu edit you have another to uh draw down menu for search another one and so on and so forth okay this is your menu bar with your uh menu commands what you do is you click on any of the words there to drag down the menu bar click on anyone of them to select the commands okay let's go to next page eleven scroll bars can you here this is your scroll bar this is your scroll bar what happen is sometimes your document is so long the window cannot take the whole data i mean it's it's thing wordperfect whatever so what happen is that you click on the up and down arrow to scroll hope you can see here then you click here then you go up and down the the page or you could click anywhere here okay to move down up and down this is your scroll bar and you got a up and down scroll bar and a left and right scroll bar this is your left and right scroll bar same light one to scroll left and right this one is to scroll up and down okay maximise and minimise button you remember at the control menu box you have to maximise and minimise you don't have to use your commands here you can use the two small little function uh i mean boxes here which you could do the up arrow is the maximise arrow maximise uh uh what you call the maximise icon this one is the small one the minimise function so if you click on the out arrow notepad takes over the full screen and you would no longer will see programme manager okay it's something like running a dos application in full screen and when you click on the maximise one it should go to the install button  question  can you see see that one the maximise the maximise button is coverted into a restore button right so when you click on that it restores you back to the size that you have had before you put in your maximise button okay and this downward arrow is the minimise button you click on that notepad is minimised as application icon but where is the icon the icon is somewhere here okay that's the notepad on the desktop this is your notepad running as a minimised application icon double click on that to get back in notepad okay whatever size it was before you analysed it you have any question so far okay i can go on eh window border this is your window border the double line window border and when you push your mouse pointer to anywhere along the border your mouse pointer is changed to a double header arrow that is when you could resize your window so if you drag and release drag and release this would have been resized if you drag and release at the corner you're resizing from both sides okay if you're doing for one side you're resizing it from one side only that's when you need to to resize it yourself okay that's why the scroll bar is is there to to to uh let you see the whichever path you word after the resizing  word  okay window corner window border we've touched that selection cursor insertion point this one i have explained before okay this is the point where once you see that blinking there whatever you type whatever you put in on the keyboard it would be reflected there okay that's page eleven any question on the terminology for windows parts of the window chapter three we have lots of hands-on so uh once we go to chapter three we have a few exercises to do chapter three is a very very important chapter once you get a hang of chapter three uh you know what windows is all about okay let's go to chapter three uhm page thirteen you don't get to see all these things because you're in a different environment okay programme manager is central to the operation of windows it starts automatically whenever you start windows it continues to run as long as you're using windows so programme manager is the one that i've that i've always stress upon programme manager okay the programme manager that you see on your environment is a full screen programme manager so you never ever get to see the green desktop actually okay later i'll demonstrate if you resize your programme manager you should be able to see parts of the three desktop here when we push it to full screen because we need as much space as possible for all the applications okay uhm let's skip the two lines there let's go down to the last paragraph notice there are technical group icons at the bottom of your programme manager you've got accessories group a group servor word  and group applications group all this you can't see it here because we are having the nusnet environment okay it's not important let's go to page fourteen more definitions okay let's go to page fourteen and uh once again i want to explain something on the screen group windows okay group windows group windows programme item icons all these things are called group icons what do you mean by group group in the sense that uhm they collect more things they are not application icons in the sense that when you double click on this it doesn't run anything for you what it does is that it opens up another windows with more icons this side so it's called a group icon and with word this icon opens up to a group window for example word-processing this is your group window for word-processing so you double click on this control menu box it shrink back to a group icon or you double click on languages compilers it opens up to a languages compilers group window showing you more icon inside okay what happen is inside the word-processing uh group window you have more icons inside and these icons are application icons in the sense that when you double click on them it does something for you it runs the application already so when you double click on wordperfect it runs wordperfect for you you double click on microsoft word five point five it runs that application for as opposed to these icons here which when you double click it shows you more icons that's all okay so these are programme item icons these are group icons and this one is a group window get it this terminologies once you are used to them you don't have to bother about them which is it's just very natural okay and windows three point one has its limitation in the sense it can take only up to two levels which means that programme manager is the group's level and this is group level one group level one opens up to group level two and by the time you come to group level two you can't have a group icon inside here already maybe you can but uh what happens is that there is a limit there is no such thing as putting a group icon into this another one opens up to another group icon this icon opens up to another window okay there comes to a time when you have to dump in programme item icons in that window you can't go on anymore that's the limitation and that's why we have so many icons here so many windows because nusnet has so many applications and windows three point one up to uh only gives you up to only two levels in the hierachy so what happens is that you've got uhm a very uhm more than complicated kind of word  okay i've touched on page fourteen any problem on page fourteen group windows group icons programme item icons okay what happens is programme item icons just band in one programme item icons are active icons if you double click on them it it will run something for you according to the definition you attach to that icon okay group icon and group windows are just uh what group windows are just window word  it's just a window word  it gives you more icons inside your group icons where you have shrunk to this okay i i'm not gonna touch accesories group games group and application group because our nusnet environment doesn't word  what i what i can point out is accesories group accesories group which you have it on here okay in accesories group you have write paintbrush terminal notepad reporter and so on  word explain briefly what are the functions of each one write is actually a very primitive word-processing application paintbrush is also very primitive graphics application terminal is for you when you want to uh put in a a modem or whatever when you want to dial up to nusnet from from your place at home you have to double click on terminal and word by  word and so on and so forth  notepad as i have demonstrated just now is also a primitive word-processor normally we use it for text editing recorder is a macro recorder in the sense that it could uhm uhm record uhm all your actions for you and you save it in with one with one one key uhm what you call it a a combination key key notes you call it so when once you just or put in the key notes you could run the whole series of uhm run functions that's what a recorder is hard-file is your hard-file calender is your calender calcu is the calculator clock clock tells you the time that is based on instant time on your on your machine i could change between digital and analog one object packager later i'll explain o l e character map media player sound recording and voice sound record you need an extra sound card character map is for you to install extra characters like uh greek or whatever character okay i'm not going to touch on that maybe now i should explain something on uh o l e i didn't touch on o l e could i have the lights on thank you very much 
Singapore	you know why because let's say okay in in any any kind of music most music form is when you write is in eight counts one two three four five six seven eight let's say uh how many of you take music how many of you take music great all basically lost okay some you know what accents are right for example let's say number one number five number one number five you have accents pump two three four pump two three four so from these accents if you put it in images it means something big one two three four one two three four one two that's an accent okay that's why i said it's much easier to do an improvisation if you know the music stand you know how the music is changed but then again it loses the whole improv you know because once you start choreographing that means you start planning it loses it's  word because it comes from here it doesn't come from here okay in order for you to get involve you have to be totally totally totally commit yourself to the music like what i did just now once in a while i could get you all and say move this move this move this no rather than that you know you look at me just now i went completely blank look blur look zero pay attention girls you all going to start and then zero yourself in this way okay any question so far any questions so far most of the music i've chosen today are those that you can feel quite easily which you can characterise quite easily okay uh i will do my last uhm imitation exercises okay for this time i just want volunteers uhm we're running short of time and i rather spend more time with you all than me me showing you i want i want uhm three from a group volunteers three from a group volunteers three from a group anybody anybody if you all don't volunteer i volunteer for you okay come right don't move don't move four guys there any of you from my school r i i pick uh one two three uhm one two three uh one two three okay uh the rest of you sit back sit back spread out spread out spread out okay how many of you know kitaro how many of you know kitaro okay he's he's a japanese composer don't next time everyone of you please pay attention he's a japanese composer specialising in asian works or making use of western music but sometimes he's ethnic japanese instruments okay uhm he's one of those composers or or artistes who lead you into confusion word  okay and his next piece from this one is from from the album called kojiki is a whole dance drama one whole album of this drama and this part is quite grand that's why you have to be very very fast i think you can't see right now i think i tell you what can you just split so they come over here split split split split split sit at the sit at the side can you come the rest just stand behind lah or sit behind or sit at the side yah okay my first imitation just now was very easy then you get into the a little bit more difficult this one is a little bit advance but uhm bear with me ready ready ready music loud  dance imitation  okay some part of the music is very heavily accented some parts are quite word which means ching it's kind of lazy you know flowy and uhm uhm if you have to put it into visuals the accents are like pup pup like that and this movement is more sphere you know it's more like a crown okay there are straight movements there are some back front all these you can use any question any question okay i tell you what find the space anywhere that you can find anywhere anywhere that is comfortable for you no need no need to face mirror just face anywhere okay some of you can come over here okay uhm too crowded over there spread out spread out some of you can go over there don't be shy i won't eat you all okay uhm okay what i want you to do right now i'm gonna play the japanese piece again and i just want you all to move ya but don't move out your sphere and go knock into each other stay as i did you do a stationary improvisation no you can stand you can sit you can jump but stay in your own sphere okay pay attention i want you to just move on your body i'm not nobody's gonna gonna word  any question this is not a test this is a chance for you to just let go i'm not here to judge okay okay you can word off anything word ready okay uh one rule which i don't want which i want everybody to follow do not look into the mirror don't look at mirror you can face anyone else and if you find that halfway through like sometimes i do improvise sometimes i find that i cannot move because i'm too conscious i'm too frightened let's say you put like uhm you know people like people i don't know i don't like for example then i like i must impress i must impress i must impress i cannot do it cause once you have that that kind of attitude that kind of competitiveness you find you're very word and slow okay what i normally just close my eyes and pretend they're not there pretend that's my mother my father my brother and my sister people you're people you're comfortable with okay let's try  dance imitation  that was fun some of i i notice some of you have got some little difficulty because uh how come share share share  audience participation  well not really once you start uhm trying rationalise your action you cannot do it worse still if it's right in front under the light so you know you tend to you tend to word  okay but i see some good stuff from some of you okay uh bear in mind like i said before there's no such thing as right or wrong improvisation what you did was as long as you feel honest about it as long as you feel good about it's okay but there is a difference between a poor improvisation and a rich improvisation i mean what is the bad sense which means like uh the music has got different different types of  word accents slurs staccatos staccatos and all this things uhm these are all i mean in in you all know music these are all added in to bring some kind of character to the music so accordingly when you do your movements you have to  word character to the music you know for example uh let's say for example if the music goes pa pa tak tak pa pa pa da dem pa pa tak tak pa pa pa da dem okay then if you do pa pa tak tak pa pa tak tak pa pa you're not you're not you're not making use you're not swiping word up your teeth all these little little word suppose to be there you get what i mean okay how do you get rid of that one thing you have to know about it you all did this you all did this you all did this you did this which you want to you know you need to notice the ball word expression also he did this just now you know there's so many your body can do so many things okay that's why one thing that i when i work with uh a lot of people they think their most visible part the part that's most outstanding usually the arms so pam pam zek zek pam pam and they end up doing this use your other parts your head your leg your eveything okay understand okay now okay it's let's as i said again it's important for you to try out because this is a practical session it's also important for you to observe right i want you to observe other people look straight uh also eye level when i see for example during the word  i done it actually move this way okay move this way that's how that's how he communicate to me that's how i create word and communicate with you all that's what that's what this session is all about it's not how pretty your movements it's not about how complex it is it's not whether i can do a split not whether i can i can kick and put my legs up here i mean it's not i can't do that okay the basis for dance is essentially what the main question is being and word same thing like writing like drama like music okay as long as if i do it and you feel touched more happy if you do it i feel touched you know i'm i'm it's okay with me i'm i'm glad at least there's some kind of interaction and word  action so okay let's start with group three and group one and group two i want to sit back and feel free to start this do the same thing okay i play the same music so that if you've got more word in what okay whose part is this  dance improvisation  okay thank you see the more you do the more conscious you become that's good and bad for one thing uh good in the sense that uhm you become more aware of what your body can do that's why i prefer to be less word so that at least i need someone to stay there because i've said i shoulders shoulders legs legs use your weight that kind of thing which is actually quite distracting you are not you're not able to fully appreciate that freedom of movement but i need to do that because or else your your movement will tend to be rather restricted okay understand but i think some of the boys were dying to use rhythm rhythm we'll use the same music again  dance improvisation  uh many of them got stuck although there is although they may seem otherwise because you're looking at the mirror close your close close i think we switch on this and switch off that ya okay who's uh standing down there just now see uhm what was he you see just now there's a lot we all were uhm i felt you were using something that i mean i wouldn't do like uh p j and  word  i call it p j okay i call you p j for short uhm he uses a lot fingers you know did you take chinese dance do you take chinese dance he moves like the monkey god do that uhm good you see you can help you you it it will help you a lot for example do you have anykind of a a a impression before you hear the music because sometimes it can help if let's say you don't just listen to the music and you just listen to music and do it it helps sometimes if you listen to the music and you form a picture you speak into the picture it's much easier that's what you did right ya because you can actually tell a story from there you know  word go go into the jungle for example then you can see a word  see you can do all sorts of things with this you can actually form a story and that's where your ensemble should come later now that's reasonable anything okay okay before i stop this time uh can how did you all feel for example  what uhm that's the way they treat it after three weeks they feel so relieved 
Singapore	may it please you my lords as far as possible my lords i'll try to deal with the arguments of my learned friend in the order that he has presented them but where necessary i will have to transpose certain parts of my skeletal arguments my lord the first argument of my learned friend was that the learned judge had considered the wrong issues on this point of course i beg to differ the learned judge had stated that there were two issues as it were one whether the appellants were aware of the forty-five per cent rule before the respondents placed their order for the t v sets then as a corollary to this he said whether the issue of the singapore certificates of origin connoted compliance with the forty-five per cent rule and then the second issue he said was whether p w three had discussed the forty-five per cent rule with d w one these issues were read to your lordship earlier and appear at the record of appeal page three hundred and twenty-five paragraph e and continues right through to page three hundred and twenty-six paragraphs a b and c now my learned friend has pointed out that the issues as stated by the learned judge here differ from what was presented in my opening the position is that it was never pleaded in the amended defence that the defendants or the appellants were unaware of the forty-five per cent rule the amended defence appears on the record of appeal at pages ten to eleven there is merely denial and put to strict proof but there was no allegation that the defendants were not aware of the forty-five per cent rule as my lords would be aware it's rather difficult at the opening speech to contemplate all the issues that will arise in the course of the evidence given particularly when the same is not obvious from the pleadings themselves in the statement of claim at page seven of the record of appeal my lord paragraph four i'd pleaded that it was an express term of the contract that the t v sets supplied would be issued with certificates of singapore origin i went on to plead the plaintiffs content that in order for the t v sets to be issued with certificates of singapore origin the plaintiffs say that the defence well knew the purpose of their requirement of the certificates of origin was to ensure that this forty-five per cent requirement existed to my mind what this implies or what this connotes is that the plaintiffs wanted to ensure that this forty-five per cent rule would be complied with and that is why they had requested for the singapore certificates of origin now in the course of evidence as developed at the trial the appellant's witnesses had repeatedly said that they had no knowledge whatsoever of the forty-five per cent rule so it became an underlying issue whether the appellants were aware of this forty-five per cent rule in my statement of claim at this paragraph four record of appeal page seven i mentioned very clearly the plaintiffs say the defence well knew the purpose of the requirement of the c o was to ensure that forty-five per cent requirement existed so knowledge is then an issue because the defendants had denied this aspect my case was that the appellants knew of this forty-five per cent rule and it was to ensure its compliance that the singapore certificate was asked for and required but the appellants maintained that they were not aware so the issue of knowledge of the appellants then was very material in this case and it was a crux issue that surfaced throughout the course of the trial of course the other ancillary issues like whether it was to ensure compliance that the respondents had contracted for the singapore certificate of origin whether it was an express term of the contract that this forty-five per cent rule were complied with whether it was an implied term that there should be compliance with this forty-five per cent rule would all of whether the appellants were aware of this forty-five per cent rule before the respondents placed their order now in this regard the discussions which p w three had with d w one the first witness for the appellants in the course of the trial which the parties had before the order was placed would be very important now as my learned friend had accepted in his submissions to my lords he accepts that there was evidence in conflict here between the parties in regard to the discussions now p w three's evidence of the discussions was that he had definitely asked the respondent's d w one whether he would the singapore company that's the appellants would definitely be able to comply with the criteria for origin requirements they said they were fully aware of this this is at the record of appeal the evidence appears at record of appeal thirty-eight b to d they said they were fully aware of this and to give him further confirmation d w one further supported by saying that they had had their own plant manufacturing t v tubes in singapore he assured that in addition he is planning to send a set of moldings to inject plastic cabinets to increase the singapore content and in further cross-examination of p w three at record of appeal forty-two d he said p w three gave evidence the forty-five per cent content rule was discussed between the parties at record of appeal forty-three the p w three insisted that he had specifically discussed the forty-five per cent rule with the appellants in page after page of the evidence of p w three we see that p w three insisted that the forty-five per cent contact rule had been discussed between the parties  chief justice : where is this please page  your honour if i could refer you to my skeletal arguments at page three under the subheading evidence one i have made a notation of all the relevant pages and the paragraphs involved  chief justice: ah yes  now at the record of appeal page forty-three paragraph c it was put to him you did not inform the defendants of the forty-five per cent local content rule and the answer i deny that they know about it we had specifically discussed it prior to the issue of letter of credit we also discussed plastic toolings for plastic cabinets to be transferred to singapore so that the singapore content could be increased to meet the singapore requirement this was an important feature for singapore goods to be imported into england goods must be manufactured in singapore and also the forty-five per cent local content rule must be complied with and then at page forty-four of the record of appeal paragraphs e to f there's mention the forty-five per cent content rule was orally discussed between me and the taiwan company towards the last paragraph put you did not mention the forty-five per cent content rule and the answers i did inform them in fact we discussed the matter at page forty-five of the record of appeal paragraph c there it's put just before the re-examination it's put at all material times neither you nor the defendants knew of the 45 forty-five per cent rule and p w three testifies we both knew of this rule because it was an understanding that they use local materials and further increase the singapore content the plastic moldings would be transferred to singapore they have made these arrangements now d w one's evidence on these discussions were different and were in conflict with p w three's the evidence of d w one appears at page forty-nine of the record of appeal forty-nine right at the top your honour it said d w one said i only told mr pandia that we were able to obtain the certificate of origin i did not mention to him about the criteria requirement as i was not aware of that at that time i am not aware of the percentage cost of the moldings in so far as the total cost is concerned it also appears at fifty-two paragraphs c to e this is d w one's evidence on discussions between the parties at paragraph c do you recall receiving a telephone call from mister pandia late september in nineteen seventy-eight or early october seventy-eight and the answer comes there were many telephone calls i can't remember when they were made he asked me if i could obtain a certificate of origin for the t v sets manufactured in singapore i told him that singapore was making picture tubes i also told him that we were going to send to singapore some moldings to make cabinets for t v sets only with picture tube and cabinets the content might not be forty-five per cent administrative and labour charges would cost fifteen per cent and the material cost would cost eight-five per cent then at page fifty-four paragraph e d w one testified in the course of our conversation i told him that our singapore company manufactured picture tubes in singapore i told him that the t v sets from singapore would have picture tubes made in singapore i also told him that cabinets for the t v sets would also be made in singapore i told him that i would be sending the moldings to singapore to meet plaintiff's requirement in regard to the casings my lord in the light of the different versions of the discussions my submission is that the learned judge had to assess the truth of the two witnesses here in the light of their conflicting evidence my lord it is my submission that in regard to the discussion the judgment of the learned judge comprises findings of fact based on the credibility or reliability of the witnesses rather than inferences drawn from specific facts now on this matter i would refer your honour to the judgment which is at that part of report of the judgment at record of appeal three hundred and thirty-one page three hundred and thirty-one it's at paragraph e under the title issue b issue b has been defined by his lordship at record of appeal three hundred and twenty-six to mean whether did p w three and d w one discuss the forty-five per cent rule before the order was placed now here the judgment reads on this issue the evidence of pandia p w three reads as follows then there is then set out the evidence of p w three which is at the record of appeal page thirty-eight b to d and which i had referred your honour to over the page at page 332 of the record of appeal the judgment goes on on this aspect of pandia's evidence lyn's reads then follows a note of  chief justice: just one moment which part of three hundred and thirty-two are you reading from  i am at para c  chief justice : i see  on this aspect of pandia's evidence  chief justice : oh yes  lyn d w one's evidence reads and then there's a quotation of lyn's evidence and after the quotation the learned judge then says at paragraph g of that page my lord on this aspect of the case on a balance of probabilities i accept the evidence of pandia that he had discussed with lyn the reasons for and implications for providing the t v sets with the singapore certificate of origin your honour there can be no clearer case to my mind that the learned judge was here weighing the probability of the two versions of evidence that was given and he had preferred the evidence of p w three in favour of d w one my lord now in regard to this portion of the argument my learned friend had cited the cases of ben max versus austin motor and ward versus thomas i don't propose to turn up the pages because the two cases decided was that there is a distinction between findings of fact based on credibility of witnesses and a finding of fact based on inferences from specific facts that is a difference between perception of facts from evaluation of facts
Singapore	your honour the findings the appeal that's before your honour here is essentially an appeal on the finding of fact made by the learned trial judge after hearing witnesses your honour i wish to take your honour very quickly to the principles on which an appellate court acts in reviewing a finding of fact and your honour these cases are referred to in my skeletal arguments the first i would refer your honour to is a case of colonial securities trust company limited versus massey and others that appears your honour at my bundle of authorities filed in respect of civil appeal number one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven that's the first case at page one i refer your honour to the headnotes it says that where a case tried by a judge without a jury comes before the court of appeal that court will presume that the decision of the judge on the facts was right and will not disturb it unless the appellant satisfactorily makes out that it was wrong your honour in this very short headnote your honour there is your honour will notice a presumption that the decision of a judge on a finding of facts was correct and secondly your honour that there is always this onus thrust upon the appellant to show that he was wrong your honour having said that i refer your honour to the second case and that's at page two of my skeletal arguments it's found at page five of the bundle of authorities that's the decision of montgomery and company limited versus wallace james your honour the facts basically in the montgomery case was an action by the plaintiff respondent in which she raised an action for interdict i believe that is the action more or less akin to an action for an injunction against the defendant appellants and other persons encroaching on a strip of ground consisting of a few yards in length and breadth situated on a edge of the river on the plea that this ground in question had from time immemorial been dedicated to the use of herself and the inhabitants for the purpose of recreation and amusement and the bleaching and dry of clothes so it essentially your honour was the issue in question was whether there was this user and whether it was established if it was she would have succeeded your honour the house of lords in this case held and found as a fact that this ground had from time immemorial been and had not been dedicated for the use as here described your honour i would refer to the decision of the earl of halsbury at page seven in which he sets out the principles which will be relevant in my submissions in this case at page seven the earl of halsbury l c said this my lord i think this appeal should be allowed it is simply a question of fact and doubtless where a question of fact has been decided by a tribunal which has seen and heard the witnesses the greatest weight ought to be attached to the finding of such a tribunal it has had the opportunity of observing the demeanor of the witnesses and judging of their veracity and accuracy in a way that no appellate court can have but where no question arises as to truthfulness and where the question is as to the proper inferences to be drawn from truthful evidence then the original tribunal is in no better position to decide than the judges of an appellate court your honour stopping here the emphasis your honour i would draw is the distinction between truthfulness truthful evidence your honour and in this case though as i have said it is simply a question of fact i do not think it is necessary to discredit a single witness in the sense of imputing to him willful untruth there are some differences between the two sets of witnesses though i think not very much on any questions which depends on the personal recollection of the witnesses and three lines down your honour he says but i give credit to the honest desire of all the witnesses to give an accurate view of the fitting?? as they themselves saw it so your honour the house of lords in that case drew a distinction in an appeal an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge if there is no question of untruthful evidence where truth has been established and rightly so in the facts of the montgomery case because we have in that case two different sets of witnesses both trying to tell the court what they saw over a long period of time there was no question of any untruthfulness they were merely relating to the court what were their personal experiences what they saw over a period of time unlike your honour in this case where both the appellant and the respondent were in control of their vehicles it was the case it was either you or i who was responsible for the accident and your honour it's my respectful submission your honour that there is a distinction truthful evidence is in issue in this case your honour if i may again refer your honour to the next case and that is the case of powell and wife versus treakin menon nursing?? now in that case it's at page forty-four of my bundle of authorities it is page forty-four your honour this was a case by a husband and wife against the nursing home for negligence causing injuries to the wife at the first instance your honour the trial judge held and allowed the plaintiff's claim in the court of appeal the defendants succeeded the house of lords your honour reverse the decision of the court of appeal and affirmed the decision of the trial judge your honour again the observations made by that court are relevant to the present proceedings i would refer your honour to page fifty at page fifty the decision the judgment of viscount selkie l c seven lines from the bottom your honour he says that on an appeal against a judgement of a judge sitting alone the court of appeal will not set aside the judgment unless the appellant satisfies the court that the judge was wrong and that his decision ought to have been the other way where there has been a conflict of evidence your honour the court of appeal will have special regard to the fact that the judge saw the witnesses and he refers to the case of clark versus edinburgh tramways where it was said that when a judge hears and see witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence that judgment is entitled to great respect and that quite and your honour i place emphasis on this quite irrespective of whether the judge makes any observation with regard to credibility or not there is no need your honour for a trial judge to say i think that this witness is incredible he is a liar there is no need for that your honour it goes on to say i can of course quite understand a court of appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in which the judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses having seen and heard them and does not believe another but that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a court of justice in courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more evenly divided witnesses without any conscious bias towards the conclusion may have in their demeanor in their manner in their hesitation in their nuance of their expression in even the turns of the eye-lids left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page what in such circumstances thus psychologically put is the duty of an appellate court in my opinion the duty of an appellate court in those circumstances is for each judge of it to put to himself as i now do in this case the question am i who sit here without those advantages sometimes broad and sometimes subtle which are the privilege of the judge who heard and tried the case in the position not having those privileges to come to a clear conclusion that the judge who had them was plainly wrong if i cannot be satisfied in my mind that the judge with those privileges was plainly wrong then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment again very quickly your honour i would also refer to page fifty-two your honour and that is somewhere in the middle third-quarter of the page just before the end of penultimate paragraph of his judgment he said having regard to the facts it is in my view quite impossible to say that the learned judge was wrong in coming to the conclusion he arrived at in favour of the plaintiff so your honour there is essentially a difficult task on the part of appellant in a case such where a finding of fact is involved and more so in the case of an accident your honour the next part of the judgment is at page fifty-six your honour and that is the decision of lord atkin i shan't take your honour longer on this case except to refer to page fifty-six and to say that and to refer to the decision i wish to express my concurrence in the view that on appeals from the decision of a judge sitting without a jury the jurisdiction of the court of appeal is free and unrestricted the court has to re-hear in other words has the same right to come to decisions on the issues of facts as well as law as the trial judge but the court is still a court of appeal and in exercising its functions is subject to the inevitable qualifications of that position it must recognise the onus upon the appellant to satisfy that the decision below is wrong it must recognise the essential advantage of the trial judge in seeing the witnesses and watching their demeanor in cases which turn on the conflicting testimony of witnesses and the belief to be reposed in them an appellate court can never recapture the initial advantage of the judge who saw and believed and in no cases should this advantage be more readily recognised than in cases which involve character and reputation and your honour the judge concluded lord atkin again at the bottom of this page he says that i have has your honour got that i have not tried to form any opinion as to what judgment i should have given if i had seen the witnesses myself there is no need for your honour to ask yourself what would i have decided your honour the onus is always on the appellant if he cannot discharge the onus to show that the judge was wrong he fails your honour the next case which i would refer to i would skip case d and that's a decision of watt versus thomas that's been referred to by my learned friend it essentially says the same thing but i would refer your honour to the last case which i have in my skeletal arguments and that's the decision of benlax versus austin motor at page seventy-seven of my bundle your honour this case i believe is a case which has been relied upon heavily by my learned friend that the court drew a distinction between the evaluation and perception of facts your honour and the facts in this case your honour concern the existence of an inventive step whether or not a certain pattern was valid your honour the relevant parts which i would quote your honour is at page seventy-eight and that's the decision or viscount simmons  at the last paragraph your honour somewhere third line from the top where he says after reviewing the previous authorities he says but i cannot help thinking that some confusion may have arisen from failure to distinguish between the finding of a specific fact and the finding of fact which is really an inference from facts specifically found my learned friend has sought to argue that what the trial judge did was an inference not of specific facts but merely on what he would say inferential findings but your honour viscount simmons himself drew a distinction and he referred to a case concerning negligence on the part of the defendant when he says that it first must be as determined whether the defendant in fact did and secondly whether what he did amounted in the circumstances to negligence  
Singapore	may it please the court your honour since there is no dispute that the respondent plaintiff was incapacitated between fifth march seventy-nine and fifteenth july eight from working i won't be going into the facts relating to that the first issue here is whether he was entitled as of right to his salaries prior to the accident your honour the respondent was both a director and shareholder of seagull marine and he was also the chairman of both companies but at the same time he was also a working director of that company and his source of income would be salaries received as a working director director's fees and dividends and these are all shown on his income tax returns your honour from page one hundred and forty-five of the record of appeal in civil appeal one hundred and seventeen of eighty-seven and in fact there on occasions he has received dividends and occasions he has received directors fees on page one hundred and fifty of the record of appeal there are payments also for director's fees from another company and from page one hundred and fifty-one there were dividends paid in respect of pan asia services but this appeal only concerns his salaries which he was drawing a sum of two thousand dollars from pan asia and five hundred dollars from seagull marine and he was earning these sums even prior to the accident his income tax returns show that these were not amounts which he just decided after the accident to take as such your honour my submission is that he is an employee of the company both the companies and in this respect i would like to refer to the appellant's bundle of authorities that's the blue bundle in one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven mr benedict chan's appeal my lord bundle of authorities number eighteen of the case marked number eighteen your honour which was taken from palmer's on company law and at the bottom it's a general statement that directors are not as such employees for the company or employed by the company nor are they servants of the company or members of the staff this becomes important in three way of instances then it goes on on the next page but i would like to start on the second paragraph of the next page at page eight hundred and seventy-six where it says a director can however pull a salary employment or an office in addition to that of his directorship which way for these purposes making an employee or a servant and in such a case he would enjoy any rights given to the employees as such on the facts of our case my lord it's quite clear that he was not just a director but he was more than a director and there is no evidence your honour that he was running the company improperly so long as the companies have complied with the requirements of the company's act i do not see how one can say that it is not a separate legal entity and that actually he was paid himself and his loss was not or rather suggested that his loss was actually what the monies which he received was actually an entitlement he could be an agent on behalf of the company and at the same time he could also contract himself when he becomes an employee and one other fact is that this were not companies which were solely owned by him as your honour has pointed out in seagull marine he only owned fifty per cent his son owned fifty per cent and in pan asia he owned thirty per cent of the shares the rest were owned by his son now the court found your honour that on the evidence presented that though he continued drawing the salaries it was not paid to him as an entitlement though the court presumed that there was an employment since he was working but there was no evidence to suggest that it was an entitlement and his reasons why he drew the salaries was that because otherwise he could not survive he needed these monies and one has to apply a very practical approach to this kind of situation your honour because in singapore especially there are very many of such companies and most people who when an incident like this occurs where they are injured they don't think of the legalities involved at that point of time the more pressing needs are raised what do they need for their medical expenses what they need for daily needs not whether he is entitled to draw the salary or not they just carry on they only apply the legalities are only addressed when they subsequently go and consult their solicitors and on that basis your honour my submission is that it cannot be accepted that what he drew as salaries was because he was entitled to now the points have been raised by my learned friend was that because they were family companies he was entitled to draw his salary my submission on that is my lord it should not make any difference whether it was family company or companies which were not owned by him what difference is therefore in such a situation to another situation where he is also a shareholder with several of his friends as shareholders and a similar situation arises and his other directors allow him to continue drawing the salary what are the principles should that situation be distinguished from this situation or they didn't where he just said we are employee where the employer says where he has been a long standing employee and he is injured seriously injured and incapacitated and the employer says never mind we will pay you your salary in the meantime and if and when you get it then we decide whether to repay it back thus i don't see why anybody should discriminate in any of these instances and in fact your honour one of the cases which was cited by the appellants was the case of esso petroleum which is in support of the fact that it is the same company and so that the plaintiff and the company are one and the same that's in the same bundle which one of the issues here was the sum of six thousand two hundred and seventy pounds which was utilized by a family company by the defendant here who was counter-claiming for his loss and the arguments put forward against this claim was that it was not his loss but his private family company's loss because the source of the funds were from that and since the company was not claiming he should not succeed the court found that it was his loss but i would like to refer your honour to all the judgments and the first judgment it should be on page eight hundred and twenty of lord denning sorry not eight hundred and twenty eight hundred and twenty-one your honour at para f in page eight hundred and twenty-one of the report paragraph f where lord denning deals with the loss if i may just read the initial capital of six thousand two hundred and seventy pounds was not provided by mr mathan personally out of his bank account it is no concern of esso where it came from your honour both the court seems to imply that it was his loss at the same time the court also seemed to imply the judge lord denning that he treated it as if that it was the loan from his own private company to him and similarly omrod l j at page eight hundred and thirty of the same report after going into the facts that both mister mathan and the company never kept a proper records and if i may just come to the last line just after paragraph c it would be for mister mathan and the company to arrange their own affairs hereafter implying that though mister mathan may have create treated the company as his own he should put the affairs in order and i would think what he meant was that these monies should go back to the company so they are actually treating these monies which mister mathan received as a loan and that is precisely what the learned trial judge in this case in our case did he treated it as voluntary payments and that is supported on the facts and it is a general rule your honour that voluntary ex gratia payments need not be taken into consideration when the court is assessing loss of earnings and i would like to refer monkmen which is on page nine of my bundle for the general principles it's a white bundle of authorities and if i may just read the three situations which are relevant here if wages of an employee have been made up by the employer the possibility of recovering the full amount without regard to this various according to the circumstance and in english law three cases have to be distinguished and voluntary payment is not to be concept of his loss of earnings cunningham versus harrison and that is exactly the situation here my lord so long as the salaries received or the monies received by the respondent were not as a result of an entitlement under his contracts for service then a court has to need or rather need not take into account these payments for assessing his loss of earnings and in cunningham versus harrison the court there ignored the fact that which is on page ninety-eight of my bundle that the court ignored the fact that the employers had paid the employee an ex gratia payment for life then again in dennis versus london passenger transport board which is on page seventy-six of my bundle here again the plaintiff received as a result of the accident he was not paid the salaries but he received equivalent to the same firm the minister of pensions and from his employers but pension in sick pay which equivalents which amounts together which equaled to his wages and he sued the tort freezer and the court held that the fact that employers or others that paid him should or quite voluntarily paid him should be naught and if i may just quote from paragraph g of the report the cardinal point to remember is that it is the defendants who are responsible for what has occurred in my opinion a wrong doer is not to be allowed to reduce damages by the extend that the other persons have made up to the plaintiff his wages like the london county council versus the ministry of pensions in this case shall be paid back to these bodies out of the sums recovered and this is what the learned trial judge also indicated in his judgment that the plaintiff was under a duty to repay his monies and on the next page in the same bundle your honour is a malaysian case of lim kiat boon which is more in line with the fact situation in our case the plaintiff also my lord your honour in this case was a director of a company on the facts it's not shown whether if he was a shareholder and he was injured and his employers paid him during his incapacity paid the medical bills and also his salary and commissions which he would have earned and in fact the evidence there also was that the employers did not expect the payment at the time they paid the salaries but subsequently they gave evidence that if the court ordered the tort freezer damages then they expect a repayment and similarly at the trial the plaintiff himself give an undertaking to the court to repay these monies if he received it back to the company and on that basis your honour the court held that he was entitled to claim his monies which even though he has been paid by his employers  then if i may referred to page seventy-eight of the bundle your honour on the righthand side sorry not seventy-eight seventy-nine on the lefthand side paragraph f that the court draws a distinction between payment received as of right and voluntary payments earlier on in paragraph e the court cites negregor on damages and says the courts appear never to have taken into account in their assessment of damages for loss of earning capacity monies gratuitously conferred from private sources upon the plaintiff as a mark of sympathy and assistant and this approach is fully supported in barry versus cleaver by the majority and minority alike reads) as of right from their employer either under a tort statutory or contractual obligation the money received is deductible 
Singapore	sir the appellant defendant's position is that this court should affirm the decision of the judge below and dismiss the respondent's notice if the court finds the following one that the general law right of set off and counterclaim has not been removed by the contract particularly clause thirty-one point eleven two that the learned judge below has exercise his judicial discretion correctly in respect of the interest awarded and his order to stay proceedings pending arbitration of the sum of five hundred and nineteen two hundred and eighty-four and thirdly the respondents and the plaintiffs should make a proper application before the registrar to amend their writ if they intend to pursue the matter relating to the sum of two hundred and six thousand dollars of course your honour have allowed the respondent to amend the respondent's notice earlier on but that is only in respect if i understand it correctly to amend the respondent's notice whether or not they will succeed on their submissions is another thing may i now go straight into the reply to my learned friend's outline submission your honour the sub-paragraph the references to the outline submission in answer to paragraph two point three of the outline submission the appellants object to the respondents raising the matter relating to the sum of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars on the grounds that a the respondents had conceded before the learned judge below that the same was properly deducted they are in respectful submission has stopped from raising this amount i will deal with this matter more fully in my later submission two the said sum of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars properly certified by the architects as an amount deductible as yong j have correctly pointed out based on my learned friend's line of submission it is my observation that that particular certificate certifying the amount of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars as being payable was made pursuant to the contract and if clause thirty-one point eleven is to be given full effect as the marginal note suggests then until such time as this certificate is set aside full effect must be given my learned friend has mentioned that they do not know how this amount was arrived may i at this juncture refer your honour to clause thirty-one point eleven of the contract to be found at page two hundred and eighty of bundle marked the record of appeal r a two page two hundred and eighty r a two what page what page two hundred and eighty your honour fifth line from the bottom of clause thirty-one point eleven in any case of doubt fifth line from the bottom of that paragraph in any case of doubt the architect shall at the request of either parties state in writing within twenty-eight days  reads  or the nature of any ruling made by him as the case may be sir clause thirty-one point eleven provides for a mode by which either party if they are not sure as to how a particular figure is arrived at in the certificate to request the architect to clarify and identify this was not done when the certificates were issued it was considered before the learned judge below i would submit that until the final determination of the case either before the courts or before the arbitrator full effect should be given to this particular certificate i pause here to add that this is an order fourteen application that we are talking about it's not the full trial and the appellant/defendant will show that they have raised triable issues for it to be tried in the full court next sir i turn to paragraphs three to fourteen of the outline submission at page two of the outline submission sir i will just say that these as my learned friend has pointed out relates to the history of proceedings and he has taken your honour through those various paragraphs and i don't think i need to address them next sir paragraph fifteen the revised certificates were held to be invalid by the learned judge below that is only in respect of the revised certificates however it is submitted that certificate number twenty-nine is not invalid or in any event the defendants have raised an arguable case for purpose of order fourteen proceedings sir may i refer you to page twenty-two of the judgment of thean j to be found at page four hundred and thirty-six r a volume two page four hundred and thirty-six r a two seventh line from the second paragraph your honour at this stage at this stage it cannot be said that this certificate is invalid nor am i in the position to say whether or not the defendants are entitled to this amount  reads  if established is deductible from the amount due to the plaintiffs sir i pause here to raise clause one point seven the learned judge has stated that and under clause seven this amount if established is deductible from the amount due to the plaintiffs i have considered in my summary reply that we are not relying on clause one point seven in respect of the three hundred and eighty-one thousand i say it because clearly one point seven does not apply but i think by drafting it or writing it as the learned judge did to say that under clause one point seven this amount if established is deductible from the amount due to the plaintiffs i think he had in mind the appellant/defendant's right of set off which in our submission has not been removed by clause thirty-one point eleven so if they ultimately can establish that this is the amount to be expanded for rectification works the architect can then issue a fresh certificate under clause one point seven there has been no final certificate issued in this case no final certificate has been issued in this case so it is still open to the architect to take into account subsequent factors and issue fresh certificates so in respect of para sixteen of the respondent's outline submission he says in the midst of the proceedings for summary judgment before the assistant registrar lojan in an apparent attempt to defeat tropicon's application suggested by letter dated twenty-fourth that they should consider taking action under clause thirty-one point four here the respondents suggesting that there are something sinister or unusual or an unusual act to defeat their claim the truth of the matter is that clause thirty-one point four provides for correcting of earlier certificates issued by the architects so it was at that point of time proper for d p architects to issue the revised certificates to correct the original certificates which the employers have indicated to them that you have not taken into account certain factors can you please look into it so my answer to that is that it was a legitimate attempt to correct the earlier certificates on the question of liquidated damages your honour at page four of my summary having withdrawn our appeal we do not challenge the learned judge's ruling on liquidated damages the appellant/defendants would accept for purposes of this appeal that the extended completion date is thirty-first december nineteen eighty-four for the main building and eighteenth february for the swimming pool and external works but we maintained that the practical completion date is first july nineteen eighty-five and this is pursuant to a certificate issued to that effect this is to be found at page three hundred and thirty three r a volume two and i don't think my learned friend is disputing that practical completion was first july eighty five sir it is important to note that when the architects certified practical completion on this day he did indicate that subject to making good of any outstanding items of any apparent defects shrinkages and other faults which appear during the defects liability period sir i pause here to say that if the dates as stated here are to be accepted technically there would have been a delay as far as the main building works are concerned a delay of six months and taking the agreed liquidated damages to be paid per day that works out to something like three hundred and sixty-six thousand dollars and this i would submit is a bona fide claim a claim which can be substantiated if not in this proceedings before the arbitrator sir i go now to paragraph seven of my summary i will skip paragraph six clause thirty one point eleven principle regarding deductions and set off so the marginal note to this clause is effect of architect's certificate it allows both the employer and contractor to claim on the architect's certificates and in the absence of fraud or improper pressure or interference by either party to obtain summary judgment it does not however remove the party's right to claim under the general law of set off and counterclaim and in support of this proposition i rely on the case of gilbert ash the house of lord's decision to be found at page one of bundle marked a b eight sir i have taken the liberty of reproducing the relevant pages unless your honour would want me to refer to the actual report i would rely on the extracts sir at page one hundred and ninety-eight paragraph d judgment of lord reed where he says the sole question in the appeal is whether by the contract with the sub-contractors the contractors have agreed that sums which they received from the employers here marked as due to sub-contractors on architects interim certificates must be paid over immediately without any rights of set off sir this is a case involving dispute between the contractors and the sub-contractors i think the principle applies equally to a dispute between employer and a contractor next sir at page two hundred j the judgment of lord morris when parties entered into a detailed building contract there are however no overriding rules of principles covering their contractual relationship beyond those which generally apply to the construction of contracts in other words there are no fixed rules or principles each case depends on the construction of the contract in question over the page judgment of lord morris again nor if the contract provides for the issuing of interim certificates should it be supposed that that's of a special class will come into existence that is that's in relation to which there can not under any circumstances be any defence of set off i think there is a spelling typographical error of set off there was no affidavit filed by the appellants but it was accepted that the claims which they had made as set out in their defence were bona fide claims sir this passage is quoted for the purpose to show that the claims that the employers have against the contractor are bona fide claims and they are not frivolous or unsubstantiated claims next the judgment of viscount bilhorn where he deals with the case of donay prior to nineteen seventy-one and the decision of the court of appeal in donays versus mintah it appears to have been generally thought that an employer was entitled to set off a counterclaim against the amount certified in halsbury law of england it is said the contractor is entitled to immediate payment thereof subject to the terms of the contract and any right of the employer to set off or counterclaim for example for liquidated damages indeed no sentilar?? of authority prior to the decision in donay's case can be found for the proposition that the amount certified by the architect in an interim certificate as the value of work done and consequently payable to the contractor i believe is in a special position in that the employer cannot lawfully counterclaim and set off against the liability amounts due to him from the contractor 
Singapore	there are two short points really in this appeal which are plainly on the evidence act but before i take your lordships into the middle of that i ought to give your lordships a slight or a fair amount of the background of this case the claim itself is for the alleged sale of about six hundred and forty thousand shares at three dollars and fifty-six cents in a limited company the completion date for that according to the claim was september of nineteen eighty-three the consideration for the delay until completion was that the defendant the appellant in this case would service an overdraft account at fee of the respondents' banks this went on to september eighty-four well past completion date when for reasons which i will come to in a moment interest on the overdraft account stopped in december eighty-four the plaintiff respondent sold out and there was a shortfall of approximately one and a half million dollars some time soon after that two sums of twenty thousand and thirty thousand were paid by the or were paid to the plaintiff my lord now that is the claim the defence there are two parts to the defence your honours the first one is that the defendant applied to strike out the claim against him on the ground that he was not the defendant or the person who is alleged to be the person who purchased the shares that's been adjourned sine die the other was based on an order fourteen application for summary judgment and that came before the learned registrar for hearing on a number of occasions and basically this is what the defendant's claim is the shares were sold it was an oral sale there's nothing in writing the defendant says or rather the defence is that khoo i call him for short khoo the broker says it was a sale to one gosali it wasn't a sale but an option to purchase the option to last for twenty-four months meantime it was to service the overdraft account gosali an indonesian filed an affidavit confirming this and that he was the buyer and then we come to this point your honour where there was a series of discussions when this fifty thousand dollars in two sums were paid now mister gosali put in his account or part of his account to show that in fact he had paid this interest and your honour will perhaps look at page one hundred and twenty-eight of the record where he lists out the various payments he made through a firm associated with the defendant now this is where the link has come in my lord that's at page one hundred and twenty-nine of the record i bring this out my lord because this startling point must have shaken the plaintiff's claim because this is a certified account my lord showing the interest payments and they go back a number of years my lord or over a certain period now this is all filed in the summary proceedings and the issue that came up immediately after that when affidavits were filed my lord on two matters which are set out in the which i will come to in a moment which were set out in the affidavits of the parties now the first the complaint your honour are really at page one hundred and nine where you will find my lord that mister gosali or mister khoo says and i ought to go through this now my lord because this is where the crux of this case is at page one hundred and nine of the record at the second paragraph there my lord i approached mister gosali with the information given to me by the plaintiff and asked him if he was interested in acquiring the plaintiff's shares on the terms mentioned and after some discussion relating to the information given by the plaintiff he agreed to take up the option by october eighty-four the shares had dropped heavily in value and it was discovered that the representations or information given by the plaintiff was false or inaccurate mister gosali then began to have different views regarding the exercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of mister gosali and the plaintiff the option was cancelled now this is mister khoo's statement your honour and mister gosali just the same and supports this statement my lord now immediately after that the plaintiff filed in an affidavit at page one hundred and thirty-four as to the rest of the said affidavit and the affidavit of erwan gosali i crave leave to refer to my affidavit of eighteenth february nineteen eighty-six i do not know who erwan gosali is and have never heard of him i crave leave to refer to paragraph ten of the affidavit of erwan gosali the negotiations were carried out between the defendant himself and on his behalf by john khoo with mister subhas anandan and were on the methods of payment of the shortfall represented by the agreed price of two million two hundred and seventy-eight thousand and four hundred less the total proceeds of six hundred and ninety six thousand and seventy-nine from the sale of s p p limited shares in the market one of the proposals put forth by the defendant to mister subhas anandan to pay the shortfall of one million five hundred and eighty-two thousand and two hundred and thirty-one plus the outstanding interest was by way of transfer of three units of housing at one tree hill gardens being developed by t k lim realty limited defendant's company annexed hereto is the copy of the telex from john khoo to subhas anandan a copy of telex marked g from mister subhas anandan to the said john khoo and a copy of a letter from john khoo to mister subhas anandan marked h giving specifications and built-up areas of the units offered by the defendant the proposal was aborted as the development was encumbered and no satisfactory proposal to life the encumbrances came from the defendant now my lords that's the first reply to gosali and to mister khoo now mister khoo then filed some affidavits it's at page one hundred and sixty-four at the bottom of the page my lord as regards paragraph eleven of the said affidavit i deny that there was any representation made by me on behalf of the defendant to mister subhas anandan who was acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations regarding the balance of the overdraft interest and not the alleged shortfall claim against the defendant mister subhas anandan had certain bias or interest in the property referred to therein and had requested more particulars thereof can i read that again my lord as regards paragraph eleven of the affidavit i deny there was any representation made by me on behalf of defendant to mister subhas anandan who was acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations the emphasis my lord at that point of time this is without prejudice this was also taken at a point of time immediately after the plaintiff put in his affidavit now my lord after that mister chew goes straightaway and files an affidavit at page one hundred and seventy-one where he lists out the various proposals and goes deeper into the negotiations my lord as to paragraph nine that's page one hundred and seventy-one as to paragraph nine of the affidavit annexed hereto and marked c g four it's a draft prepared by mister subhas anandan which incorporated one of the proposals made by the defendant for securing payment of the amount claimed by the plaintiff by the issue of shares to the plaintiff by alitier private limited which shares were to be paid for by capitalisation of the defendant's loans to his own family company the proposal set out in so and so fell through and defendant offered to transfer three units of housing in the one tree hill garden for this purpose i had the valuation of the units made annexed here is a copy letter to mister subhas anandan dated twenty-fifth january eighty-five enclosing the valuation the price of the units to be transferred to the plaintiff was to be the payment of the amount due to the plaintiff as the price of the three units pegged at two hundred and eighty dollars per square foot exceeded the amount of the plaintiff's claim the plaintiff eventually agreed to take two units and the balance of his claim to be paid by the defendant in cash i then instructed messengers goh poh and partners to help in drafting the agreement for this proposal i have heard that searches showed that the property was encumbered to the limit of five million annexed hereto is a copy of the company's search on alitier private limited showing the charges registered against the company and a copy of certificate of title showing the circumstances marked c r t seven goh poh and partners then wrote to messenger subhas anandan on twenty-ninth july as per annexed so and so my lord now the learned judge hearing the appeal from the registrar said that the door had been opened the initial statement made by gazali and khoo i haven't read gazali's one but i will now now i'll go back again to mister khoo first because it's important to know whether the door in fact had been opened it's at paragraph fifteen let me read it again my lord mister gazali then began to have different views regarding the exercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of mister gazali and the plaintiff the option was cancelled now gazali says your honour at page one hundred and twenty-eight my lord i missed that paragraph ten my lord of his affidavit gazali's affidavit after a series of discussions between the plaintiff and my intermediaries it was agreed in early december nineteen eighty-four i could abandon the option provided i paid interest in the sum of fifty thousand payable in two installments i duly paid the same now this is what is supposed to have opened the door to the negotiations because from then on mister khoo promptly pulls the door wide open and brings in various points that were raised and which are in the without prejudice negotiations which mister khoo properly said and gave notice in his affidavit these are without prejudice now of course the other side or rather the judge has held well you shouldn't have put in all these other facts if you say it's without prejudice why did you not just stop there and just say these are without prejudice it should be either struck out or removed from the record my lord i have an authority to this effect my lord that you are entitled to state your case in the event that you do not be allowed to treat these statements or documents as being in fact without prejudice the simple reason is a lot of people mark their letters or their statements without prejudice when there is no dispute and no negotiations as such in the sense that there is a pending court case and then they call it without prejudice you see it very often my lords i'm sure your lordships in your long careers must have seen this being used very freely it means nothing unless there is a dispute that's going to court the words without prejudice mean absolutely nothing make no effect they have no effect at all my lord you can say without waiving my rights and that doesn't prevent it becoming admissible now the last affidavit was done on the thirteenth of may my lord and on the twentieth that's three days after the application to strike out was made my lord now the two grounds that were given by the learned judge who heard the view or appeal was one that only the parties to the negotiations have this privilege no third party is entitled to it  now may i just point out my lord, and i've got it in the skeleton at page 3 my lord 
Singapore	my first point is in regard to the first and second accused's ability to speak english my submission basically is that your honour have had the opportunity of seeing the first and second accused in the witness box giving evidence and reciting what they alleged were told by the police officers with ease and with precision sentences such as you sign you say yes lah no sign see than man hantam you you sign give you makan cigarette go back bangladesh in that precise order they have not once mixed up the order and it is my submission that these are hardly the actions of a person who doesn't speak english or who doesn't have sufficient working knowledge of english your honour have also got to bear in mind that the first accused had spent about two years in singapore and the second accused had spent about a year and three months in singapore during that period they had contacts with locals and it is by their own admission that they picked up local words like makan and hantam the second accused even went to the extent of saying that he learned a number of malay words which he recited to this court and it is my submission that through sheer necessity and through exposure they had picked up more english words in singapore than they had learnt in bangladesh your honour have also had the opportunity to see that the two accused are reasonably intelligent persons their geography of singapore is also very good during that period they picked up names of places in singapore with ease that is hardly again my submission the action of people who were illiterate in english they would have had much difficulty in picking up these words had they not had a working knowledge of english my other point is that the two of them were also able to communicate with asmah binte salim with whom they were acquainted and the second accused had given an example of what he said to asmah on the twenty-first of january nineteen eighty-eight before he visited her at her place at macpherson coming to the assaults that the first accused alleged against the police we first had his evidence that he was assaulted at dunlop street on the thirty-first of january nineteen eighty-eight your honours have heard evidence from the police officers who denied that they ever assaulted the first accused at dunlop street and when i cross-examined him his evidence was that there was a crowd there is it reasonable for the police officers to assault a person whom they were arresting in the presence of a crowd i am asking your honours to draw the inference that it is not reasonable and never took place we have the evidence of the police officers today that the first accused only put up a mild resistance now in view of that was there any point in them to have assaulted him in a public place the evidence of the first accused is also at variance with the evidence of the police officers the first accused said he was pushed to a wall after having been handcuffed the police officers stated that he was never pushed against the wall his hands were placed on the bonnet of a car again why should the police officers lie on this point we now come to the stage where the first accused was taken back to the c i d after his arrest at dunlop street his evidence is that he was assaulted by the police officers in the detectives' office koh low and quek we have the evidence of sergeant quek that it was only he and corporal koh who were guarding the accused in the detectives' office sergeant koh was doing the questioning alone pending the arrival of inspector yeoh again this is at variance with the first accused's evidence that he was questioned by both quek and koh i am asking your honours to accept the evidence of sergeant quek that koh never interrogated or questioned the first accused and that no assault ever took place in that room when inspector yeoh arrived at the office at eight p m his evidence is that he took the first accused into his office where he interviewed briefly and the first accused told him that the second accused who was also involved in the case was residing at mandai now your honours have heard the evidence of the police officers that they had no difficulty in locating the house at mandai i am suggesting that if the first accused had merely uttered the word mandai and not specified the location to the inspector they would have great difficulty in locating the house my argument is fortified by the fact that the inspector has given evidence alongside the evidence of sergeant quek that the first accused had drawn a sketch-plan of the general locality of the house we have heard evidence from the first accused that he has stayed there for three or four days is it therefore unreasonable to suppose that they could have produced such a sketch-plan  he of course denies it altogether  he denies it altogether now as far as the medical examination forms are concerned your honours have already seen them in conjunction with the reports put up by the doctors the doctors' reports contain information that were not set out in the medical examination forms and it is my contention that it is only the accused themselves who could have volunteered those information to the doctor if it was my learned friend's contention that the doctor had gleaned the information from the police officers then it would be self-defeating because it would mean that the accused persons have told the police officers which would in turn lead to the conclusion that they couldn't have been ignorant of the english language and their evidence all along has been that they never spoke one word to the police officers during the questioning for the reason that they could not understand the officers coming to the recording of the first accused's statement in the field diary which is exhibit p fifty-three marked for identification your honours have heard evidence from the inspector that the first accused gave him a statement at about ten thirty p m in english inspector has testified in court that the sentence construction in that statement is his he's not denying the fact but he maintains that the first accused was able to communicate without difficulty in english with him now it's my submission that your honour should accept the inspector's evidence in this respect because your honour have seen the way the first accused had given evidence in court and i submit that he was conversant in english at the time he gave the field diary statement to the inspector as far as the second accused's statement in the field diary is concerned we have heard evidence from inspector yeoh that the second accused even told him that he studied up to college level in bangladesh and studied english and again it's my submission  it's not suggested that the inspector has fabricated that  no  so why are you objecting  it must have come from the second accused and your honour it brings me to the point about which are the officers who brought the accused persons into the inspector's room we've heard the first accused say that on every occasion it was koh and low  yes  but your honour would have also heard evidence from the police officers with reference to their lock-up diary their pocket books or whatever contemporaneous records that they had made that on different occasions it was different officers who brought them into the room and i submit that that piece of contradiction goes to show that the accused person had fabricated all the evidence about the assaults that had taken place prior to their being taken into may it please your honour  yes  i am much obliged to your honour for allowing me to start late your honour at the close of yesterday's proceedings i was asked by your honour to submit on section one hundred and twenty-one of the criminal procedure code i have produced before you sirs two cases which are relevant to this point but before i touch on those two cases perhaps we could look at the wording of 121 again your honour section one hundred and twenty-one point one merely lays down the general principle that a police officer who is making an investigation has the power to examine any person including the accused who is supposed to be acquainted with all the facts and circumstances of the case and that he has an obligation to record in writing what he has examined orally sub-section two sets out the general principle that when a person is examined by a police officer orally he has the obligation to state the truth except that he may refuse to state any fact or circumstance which would have a tendency to incriminate him that is actually a principle against self-incrimination section one hundred and twenty-one does not say that the person has to be warned of this particular provision of his right not to self-incriminate and this is borne out by the two cases which i have produced before you the first is public prosecutor against chandran and two others the report is contained in nineteen eighty-nine clasnews number three page eleven unfortunately it appears not to have been reported in the malayan law journal your honour this is a case of three persons being charged with an offence of murder committed in prosecution of a common object of an unlawful assembly and the relevant parts of the judgment can be found on page thirteen of the report on page thirteen right-hand column under the heading trial within a trial the judge said in that case however objections were strenuously raised by counsel for the three accused with regard to the statement which each of them gave to the police subsequently in the course of police investigations which are hereafter referred to as the section one hundred and twenty-one statements accordingly a trial within a trial was held to determine the admissibility of these statements the section one hundred and twenty-one statement of the second accused was taken first by inspector maniam of the special investigation section of the c i d over three days on seventh eighth and twenty-third of may nineteen eighty-five this statement was recorded in three parts the third part has been detached because it relates to the personal background of the second accused the grounds of objection raised by the second accused on the first two parts of the statement were and the relevant ground is one a warning substantially in terms of the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-one point two of the c p c was not properly explained to the second accused before the commencement of the statement on seventh of may and the third ground is also relevant that the warning was not administered to the second accused when the statement was continued on the eighth of may turning over to the next page your honour could you look at the left-hand column second paragraph quite apart from this question whether or not the warning was properly administered to the second accused there is the more general question as to whether there is any requirement that the warning must be administered to an accused before he gives his statement we do not think there is anything in section one hundred and twenty one that requires that this be done nor do we think that a failure to administer the warning to an accused renders his statement taken down under section one hundred and twenty one is inadmissible in evidence under section one hundred and twenty two point five of the c p c 
Singapore	much obliged my lords my lords if i may take this appeal in the manner in which i have dealt with in my skeletal arguments unless your lordships have should say otherwise my lords and i shall proceed to go through briefly the facts which because of the nature of the arguments which will be raised subsequently they are some of them are material for the purpose of this appeal my lords this appeal arises from a decision of chan sek keong judge?? be it on the twenty-sixth day of july nineteen eighty-nine ordering the petition filed herein by the appellants in his company's winding up petition number seventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine on the seventh day of march nineteen eighty-nine he struck out and the action dismissed on the grounds that the petition and/or the proceedings instituted by the appellants thereunder constitute an abuse of the process of court two the cause of this application herein detects and paid by the appellants to the respondents and the company now in so far as the facts which are material to this appeal are concerned my lords my lords may i be permitted to proceed with paragraph two the appellants are members and minority shareholders of chong lee leong seng company private limited herein after referred to as company and on the seventh of march nineteen eighty-nine instituted proceedings under the company's act chapter fifty in company's winding up petition number seventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine to seek relieve under section two hundred and sixteen of the act against certain of his directors on the grounds that the latter a had conducted the affairs of the company in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company including the appellants and/or in this regard of the appellant's interest as a member of the company and/or b who are exercising their powers as directors of the company in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company including the appellants and/or in disregard of the appellant's interest as members of the company and/or c had acted and are then or are threatening to act in a manner which unfairly discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the appellants as members of the company the principle relieve served by the appellants was for the company to be wound up by the court under the provisions of the company's act with other relieves prayed for my lords pausing here for a moment if i may just refer your lordships to the petition itself just to page twenty-seven of the record my lords which sets out the relieve sought by the appellants in their petition page twenty-seven of the record have your lordships got that page now your lordships will note preceding the prayer for relieve there is a statement my lord in that paragraph beginning with in the circumstances and i read my lord in the circumstances the petitioners have been advised that it is just an equitable that the company be wound up and then the prayers go on in prayer a one sorry my lord that chong lee leong seng may be wound up by the court under the provisions of the company's act so my lord what i wish to stress at this point in time is that the relieve sought if i may expand on that my lord are one a winding up under the just an equitable rule which is under section two hundred and fifty-four my lords of the company's act two hundred and fifty-four my lords if i may refer you at page three hundred and forty-eight of the singapore statutes chapter fifty now i would like to draw your lordship's attention to two provisions in that section section two hundred and fifty four point one reads the court may order the winding up if and then we go on to f the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interest rather than in the interest of the members as a whole or in any other manner whatever which appears to be unjust unfair or unjust to other members and under i the court is of the opinion that it is just an equitable that the company be wound up so that my lords this section two hundred and fifty-four comes under the division of the company's act relating to the winding up by the court and i intend to later develop the argument that in the case of oppression so to speak my lords the petitioner or the oppress minority so to speak may have availability to wind up under section two hundred and fifty-four or two hundred and sixteen and the nature of my arguments will be that two hundred and sixteen provides for an additional ground for winding up and that has been confirmed my lords by the learned judge in his judgment itself but suffice it to say my lords at this point in time it is pertinent to point out indeed two revealing sections in the companies act relating to winding-up so to speak in respect of acts committed by officers of the companies and in which relief is being sought by a shareholder generally called the oppressed shareholder my lords my lords the petition was presented on the seventeenth of march nineteen eighty-nine under the provisions of the companies winding-up rules nineteen sixty-nine and in accordance with rule twenty-three thereof the registrar appointed twenty-first april eight-nine as the date on which the petition was to be heard the petition was thereupon served on the company on the twentieth of march eighty-nine and the persons named therein as the respondents that is the directors of the company now my lords this date twentieth march is significant because of the arguments which will later be developed on the question of whether there was any waiver of the irregularity if any now on the seventh of april nineteen eighty-nine the petition was advertised as required by rule twenty-four of the nineteen sixty-nine rules on the eighth of april and tenth of april nineteen eighty-nine a total of four affidavits were filed on behalf of the company in opposition to the relief sought under the petition so after the appearance of the advertisement four affidavits were filed by the respondents by the company on the tenth of april nineteen eighty-nine the company through their solicitors applied for and were granted a validation order under the provisions of section two hundred and fifty-nine of the companies act that is under the winding-up division inter alia that payments made by the company and on its behalf including payments out of the company's bank accounts and all other transactions and dispositions of property by and on behalf of the company and in the ordinary course of business up to and including the date on which the petition is disposed of shall not be avoided by virtue of the provisions of section two hundred and fifty-nine of the companies act however before the petition could be heard on the twenty-first of april nineteen eighty-nine the company on the fourteenth of april that is after having filed the four affidavits in reply in opposition to the petition and after having applied for the validation order on the thirteenth of april then applied for an order under order eighteen rule nineteen of the rules of the supreme court and my lords this is where the second part the record of appeal which we have tendered in that sets out the summons-in-chambers and it would be i think necessary to just look at the summons-in-chambers and see what precisely was the relief sought by the respondents this is at record of appeal bundle two summons-in-chambers the applicants prayed for the following orders one that the time for service of this application be reached two that pursuant to order eighteen rule nineteen point one and/or the inherent jurisdiction of this honourable court the petition herein is struck off and the action be dismissed on the grounds that the petition and/or the proceedings instituted by the petitioners there under constitute an abuse of the process of court if i may just digress for a moment my lords what they are saying is because the petitioners had instituted the proceedings in the way they did that act of commencement under the winding-up rules constituted an abuse of the process of court and it was on that ground and no other that the summons-in-chambers to strike out was filed and upon which the order was subsequently made by the learned judge three that pursuant to his inherent jurisdiction this honourable court may make such orders as it deems fit for the purpose of remedying the consequences of the said abuse again my lords the whole tenor of the application was abuse of the process of court and of course prayer four that summons my lords is a question the prayer for costs which we need not deal with my lords as we understand it if i may resume with paragraph eight of my skeletal arguments the main ground for the allegation of abuse of process is that proceedings for any relief from oppression must be commenced under order eighty-eight of the r s c and not under the winding-up rules and therefore ought to be struck off under order eighteen rule nineteen or under order ninety-two rule four of the r s c that is basically the main attack my lords of the procedure adopted by the appellants that it must be commenced under order eighty-eight the application was heard by chan sek keong justice in chambers on the twenty-first of april eighty-nine that was day on which it was assigned by the registrar my lords to hear the petition itself and by way of a reserved judgment dated twenty-sixth july nineteen eighty-nine chan sek keong justice ordered the petition to be struck out on the ground that it was improperly presented as a winding-up petition under the companies winding-up rules sixty-nine since he was of the view that the proceedings ought to have been properly commenced by way of a petition pursuant to the provisions of order eighty-eight of the rules of the supreme court nineteen seventy and if i may just at this point of time conveniently refer to order eighty-eight my lords it's at page two hundred and ninety-five of the r s c and that order is entitled the companies act nineteen sixty-seven which is our present chapter fifty my lords now if your lordships were to look at rule five the following page the following applications under the act must be made by petition and this rule my lords prescribe the mode of commencement of the various actions under the companies act namely applications and we are only concerned with h my lords under section one hundred and eighty-one of the act for relief in cases of oppression the section one hundred and eighty-one mentioned therein is now section two hundred and sixteen of our revised statutes my lords of the companies act so my lords what rule five of order eighty-eight prescribes is the mode of commencement and if i may just this may be basic but i think it's needed to stress at this point in time my lords that there are only four modes of commencing proceedings in the high court in singapore namely the writ of summons originating summons petition and originating motion only four modes in which to commence originating process in the high court and rule five prescribes that an action for relief under section one hundred and eighty-six must be commenced by petition so that my lords if for instance an oppressed shareholder decides to commence by way of a writ of summons then of course he would have used the wrong mode for commencement and that mode would be totally one which is contrary to order eighty-eight rule five h  and it is necessary my lords to stress at this point of time this argument because as i develop my arguments further my lords what the respondents did in this case was also to commence the action by way of a petition under the winding-up rules so the mode of commencement is important what order eighty-eight prescribes is the mode of commencement 
Singapore	may it please you my lord we are finally here for the purpose of presenting to your lordship our submissions on this matter and in respect of which the hearing has gone on almost four days three days in fact i have my lord at the beginning of this trial given to your lordship the list of authorities i will be relying on in support of my client's case and this morning my lord i have in fact given to my learned friend and to your lordship's secretary a very brief submission on what the issues are in this case what i plan to do my lord is this as i see it from the defendant's case what i plan to do my lord is this to perhaps just go through the issues with your lordship and then with your lordship's permission to go through the list of authorities and perhaps go through the law as well subject of course at any time to your lordship stopping me and saying that it will not be necessary for me go through it if your lordship has in fact read through it i have in fact in submitting these authorities highlighted in my bundle the paragraphs that i will be reading so with that my lord if i may be permitted to start as i see it my lord the issues in this case are very simply did the plaintiff when she transferred the subject property to the defendant intend the transfer to be a gift of the property from her to her son that's the first issue my lord that has to be decided upon if it was a gift then that is the end of the matter with regard to the subject property if on the other hand my lord the court is of the view that it was not a gift that the question that then comes up for consideration was whether the as to whether or not the property was transferred to the defendant on the terms that the defendant was to be a trustee of the property and he was to re-transfer the property back to the plaintiff after she had obtained her identity card now with regard to this these two issues the plaintiffs of course rely from their statements of claim on the point of undue influence the third question that your lordship has to consider is whether there were any conditions governing the use of the money held in the bank account opened in the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant my lord with regard to the first question the defendant's case is that the property was transferred by the plaintiff by her own free will to the defendant now in support of this my lord i rely on the defendant's own evidence as well as the evidence of the defendant's second witness in further support of this statement i am also relying my lord on the certificate of title which quite clearly indicate in the agreed bundle that the property was transferred as a gift of course my lord i concede that this evidence of the defendant is denied by the plaintiff and hence therefore the court will have to decide as to which of the parties testimony is to be believed in short my lord the case falls on which of the two parties are to be believed the plaintiff or the defendant it's my case my lord that notwithstanding the cross-examination by the plaintiff both the defendant and his witness have maintained their strong position on the evidence with regard to the second point it is my submission my lord that the question of a trust cannot arise this is because if it was so the transfer of title would have evidenced and this in support further support of this i rely on the evidence of the defendant to prove this my lord having said this may i just draw your lordship's attention to the pleading itself the action itself my lord admittedly was commenced by a different firm of solicitors to my learned friend and in the supplemental bundle of pleadings at page six your lordship will see from the amendments that were made to the pleadings as to exactly what was the plaintiff's case before the twenty-sixth of july nineteen eighty-eight when the amendment was when the statement of claim was amended for the first time before the amendment the plaintiff's case was that there was an arrangement between the defendant and the plaintiff that she would have the same right and enjoyment over the property prior to the transfer when the amendment was made she says for the first time on the twenty-sixth of july nineteen eighty-eight that the transfer was induced and then she says it was without independent advice for the first time these two allegations are made and for the very first time she then states what the inducement is i draw this to the court's attention because i think it plays an important part when one comes to read the testimony of the plaintiff if this was true if it was true that she was induced to transfer the property and if it was true that she was induced to transfer the property on the basis of undue influence my question my lord is why was this not stated from the first moment she started this action why has she held it back and only subsequently chosen to produce this line of thinking the query that i have is is this sincere or has this been built up has this argument been built up by her in order to create a situation where there was undue influence when in fact there was none even with regard to the question of the transfer of the property back to her the allegation that when she gets the identity card back the defendant would have to transfer the property back to her surfaces for the first time only after twenty-sixth july nineteen eighty-eight and likewise the condition that the plaintiff should be allowed to stay in the property for the rest of her life has she been honest to this court in saying what she has said add to it my lord is the fact that she now says that there was ill-treatment that's not much of a new point i concede because it was there before the amendment was made but certainly she has made the allegation even more serious by stating that she was forced to move out of the property and has then sought to rely on the care and concern of her two daughters for abode my lord i draw this to the court's attention and leave the court to draw its own inference as to why this has been stated at such a late juncture looking at the amended looking at the defence of the defendant there can be no doubt his stand has always been as it has been and the amendments that were made in the amended defence were merely the consequences of her sad and pitiful story as put up by her if it is true and if one looks at the defence one would see that it tallies very much factually with what the plaintiff herself has admitted in this context i refer to the allegations that she was performing illegal abortions that she had a criminal record for that and the fact that he denies that there would be a re-transfer of the property the next point my lord which i would like to make is this namely that i would ask the court to draw its own inference as to why it has taken the plaintiff so long to commence this proceedings and to seek the court's remedy for a declaration your lordship would see when i go through the law that such an inference can be drawn from the facts of this case my lord it cannot be doubted from the evidence that has been presented to this court that the plaintiff is not as educated as her son has been who has been fortunate to be but even he too my lord does not enjoy that sort of education that perhaps the other two children of the plaintiff have p w two she says is a programmer certainly it calls for education much higher than what the defendant has prior to that being a school teacher my lord it cannot be doubted further that the plaintiff is a thrifty person very much a characteristic of perhaps that generation but one has got to look at her in the light of her mother sixty-nine years of age widowed since thirty-seven but with only one son and two daughters from the evidence that has been given to this court she denies that she had made a gift of this property she supports her argument by the evidence of p w two if one goes through the evidence of p w one she admits her illegal abortions when she admits her record it confirms the evidence of the defendant on this but where her evidence goes out of the way is on the question as to whether there were conditions attached to the gift here she relies for strength and support on the testimony of p w two my lord my client does not deny and his evidence bears it out and i think the mother's evidence bears it out too that he loved his mother and his mother loved him but where the dispute comes about my lord is the fact that on the unfortunate day when p w two choose to return back to the home and that quarrel took place that that's when this whole case began it is my submission my lord that if one looks at the evidence of p w one objectively and then looks at the evidence of p w two in the light of what the defence has said it is extremely clear that this whole litigation has been motivated by and brought about by events that took place and the circumstances and the relationship that now exists between p w two and the defence witness one having said this my lord may i be permitted to look at the evidence of the defendant with regard to the transfer of the house notwithstanding cross-examination by my learned friend he maintains his point though perhaps in a strong and hard way that there was never any conditions attached to the property being transferred to him he admits that there was the sad circumstances surrounding his mother's record but denies in any way that that played any part in causing her to transfer the property to him or was even instigated or motivated by him that she should do so that being so my lord one has got to therefore take out these factors and see whether such a person as the plaintiff could have transferred the property as a gift to the son a little supplemental factor that comes into play is i think the fact which cannot be denied that perhaps there was a bad relationship that took off between the plaintiff and her daughter-in-law it may have been prompted by the fact that the plaintiff had not been invited for the defendant's wedding but then his evidence speaks for itself when he said that it was a very simple ceremony that he had and that there were only two witnesses present i think my lord it must be so that in a muslim marriage the witnesses can only be muslims the evidence of d w two supports the point that the mother was aware of the fact that her son was in the company was frequently in the company of a muslim lady and subsequently converted to the faith look at that my lord in the light of the character of the plaintiff character of the defendant as set out by d w two  my lord i think it's a fact to say that converts tend to be stronger in their faith than born, people born in the faith and i think from the opening evidence of the defendant it's quite clear that he is a staunch muslim now brought up in the teachings like in all other religions that one should respect one's parents 
Singapore	your honour i have put up briefly written submissions based on the main issues adduced in this trial and i will go according to the subject matter accordingly your honour the first issue is what is the nature of the contract what is in fact the contractual subject matter your honour the solution to this issue has to be found in the contract dated tenth september nineteen eighty-three which is evidence in exhibit one and two of the agreed bundle your honour it is very pertinent to note that these contract was drafted by the defendant company and not by the plaintiff's company it is only countersigned by the plaintiff's company at the end of the contract at page two your honour i submit that the subject matter of contract evidence by this letter from the defendant company was for the defendant to supply approximately eight thousand tons of p w d b one asphalt premix to the plaintiff's project at yio chu kang road hereafter i will just refer to the project your honour it was not a contract to supply all the asphalt premix which was required by the project your honour my inference is based on the following points the parties contemplated that the defendants will supply and lay approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix to the project at sixty-six dollars your honour the meaning of the word approximately means about or more or less and this is this meaning has in fact been given by the candidate court of appeal case in british wheat carbassing company limited versus e d eddie company limited reported in nineteen twenty-one fifty-nine normally law report page seventy-seven which can be found in the plaintiff's bundle of authorities at page twenty-three to twenty-eight if your honour would refer to the plaintiff's bundle of authorities to this particular case at page twenty-three which i submit that this case has some relevance to our case in point your honour this is before the supreme court of canada and in this case the facts are stated in the headnote an agreement for the sale and purchase of paper contained the following clause one hundred and fifty tons approximately of paper per year and it was held your honour the court held that on the proper construction of these clause that the contract was for the sale of one hundred and fifty tons of paper per year the word approximately was only to provide against incidental variations arising from slight and unimportant excessors or deficiency and that each year must stand by itself the contract not being for four hundred and fifty tons during a three year period the words being the whole of the purchase requirements did not form any controlling part of the contract and were merely an intimation as to the purchaser's requirements your honour i quoted this case merely to show you the meaning of the word approximately it doesn't much go much further than that here the contract will sell approximately one hundred and fifty tons of paper per year and that instead supplied short of it and i think the issue before the court is revolves the word around the word approximately and it was held that we have to give incidental deficiencies and surpluses to that figure so in our case the figure eight thousand tons was provided for and therefore the actual tonnage supplied by the defendant company was seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-five point ninety one tons which is only three point three per cent short and therefore the word approximately would cover the shortfall of three point three per cent may i carry on your honour next the caption re-surfacing of road at yio chu kang road in the said contract at page one your honour if you look at the caption it merely says servicing of road at yio chu kang road it is submitted that this caption was used conveniently to facilitate easy reference in the exchange of correspondence between the parties the caption did not specified the exact points between which the defendants were to lay the asphalt premix the plaintiff's contract with p w d in contrast and as pleaded in paragraph one of the statement of claim and admitted by the defendants was to construct and widen yio chu kang road second carriage way from sembawang hills to jalan kayu p w d's contract was very specific from which points of yio chu kang road to which point the contract made between the plaintiff's company and the defendant's company never mention the exact points between which asphalt premix had to be laid next your honour clause three of the contract at page one thereof it says that please note that we are not responsible for the variation in thickness laid as our quotation quoted to you is on metric weight only your honour i submit that the word our quotation must referred to the quotation as evidence in this contract and the quotation is an offer to supply approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix there cannot be any other things besides this which is so clearly provided for in clause two this is reinforced by the word metric weight only and metric weight your honour i submit must refer to the eight thousand tons metric tons of asphalt premix referred in clause two therefore clause three obviously show the intention of the writer that this quotation is an offer to the plaintiff's company to lay to supply and lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of asphalt premix at sixty-six dollars any other construction would make this contract redundant in a sense that if it is to lay the whole of the project then there is no need to mention a quantity in the asphalt premix to be supplied your honour it is also given by p w one witness f w one in this trial that it is customary unusual for contracts of this nature to always bear a limit on the tonnage to be laid next your honour the defendant's statements of supply as shown in the agreed bundle and for most of them they have printed words like site and tons and even have column for quantity supplied tons and balance to be supplied tons these words are not put there for fun they must have served a purpose this is basically to show or it would indicate to the defending company when they have breached the approximate limit if indeed the contention is that it was for the defendant to supply the whole of the asphalt premix then there is no necessity when they are laying the premix in stages to keep track of the tonnage laid it's not necessary in fact they should have just add up the total towards the end of the whole project and say oh this is ten thousand tons and twelve i submit your honour that all these clauses and words used in this contract point to the fact that the parties contemplated at page three of my submissions your honour paragraph h contemplated a quantitative definition of the subject matter of the said contract and this subject matter was uppermost in the minds of the contracting parties when they make the contract and it was definitely not an open-ended contract where no quantity or tonnage is specified the subject matter to be gleaned from all these wordings and from the evidence and testimony in this court in totality re-enforces the plaintiff's version that this contract was a simple one it was for the defendant company supply of approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix at sixty-six thousand dollars and not for the defendant to supply the whole of the asphalt premix requirement for the project your honour it is also pertinent to note that the total tonnage laid for the whole project by the defendants and resources development corporation total up to nine thousand eight hundred and forty-four point fourteen tons and in percentage terms it is twenty-three per cent more than the estimated eight thousand tons stipulated in the said contract your honour p w one witness p w one had been in the road construction business since nineteen sixty-two and is unlikely given his experience and expertise to under provide twenty-three per cent of asphalt premix required by the project therefore p w d's testimony that he estimated eight thousand of asphalt premix for part of the project from ang mo kio avenue four to yio chu kang track fourteen is credible d w one and d w three corroborated p w one that a figure of eight thousand tons of premix originated from the plaintiffs on this first point your honour i submit this conclusion that the defendants had supplied seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-five point ninety-one tons of asphalt premix to the project it had been permitted to perform its obligation to supply approximately eight thousand tons the shortfall of two hundred and sixty-four point zero nine tons or three point three per cent of the estimated eight thousand tons is small given the nature of this type of contract and the circumstances of this case and the de minimis rule should apply to absolve the plaintiff from being liable for this shortfall if i may proceed your honour i will go on to the next point on the cannons of construction of written contracts in the case of clear and unambiguous contract your honour i submit that the contract was clear unequivocal and free from ambiguity the words used therein are to be construed in their plain ordinary and popular sense clauses one and two of the contract and three in their plain and ordinary meanings can only be interpreted to mean that the defendants were to supply deliver and lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of asphalt premix at sixty-six dollars per ton clauses one and two and three i may add are not susceptible of any other interpretation the defendant's contention that they were entitled under the said contract to supply all the asphalt premix required by the project contradicts or varies clauses one two and three of the contract and where the words of a written agreement have a clear and fixed meaning extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show that the parties meant something different from what have written  ninety-four  section ninety-four of the evidence act precludes the admissibility of the testimony of d w one and d w three which seeks to show that the parties meant something different from what have been written in the contract your honour the next point is this the defendants drafted the contract which was countersigned by the plaintiffs the rule of construction is that a deed or other instrument shall be construed more strongly against the grantor or maker thereof the contra proferentum rule is best summarized by in a case of john lee and son versus rail executive and i quote a passage of abasad master of the roll we are presented with two alternative readings of this document and the reading which should be adopted is to be determined among other things by a consideration of the fact that the defendants put forward the documents they have put forward a clause which is by no means free from obscurity and have contented that it has a remarkably if not extravagantly wide scope and i think that the rule contra proferentum should apply as in our case your honour this is a typical case of a written contract where the defendant company is seeking to expand the scope of the contractual matter so extravagantly and i would urge your honour to apply the contra proferentum rule against the defendant i do not admit that this contract is ambiguous and capable of two interpretations but indeed it is then i submit that the contra proferentum rule should be used against the defendant who was the drafter of the contract 
Singapore	may it please you my lord i appear together with my learned colleague mister loh chai chong for the plaintiffs and my learned friend mister isaac nathan together with mister brown appear for the defendants my lord my lord we are grateful for your lordship for having given us granted us the indulgence to start this case a little late primarily because we wanted to get some primary documents from the police officer concerned now he has arrived and he has given part of the documents but he hasn't got a complete list so he's trying to locate the other part now but in any event for present purposes i think i'll put him in the witness-box at the appropriate stage and introduce his evidence and then perhaps later on he can come back and let us have the remaining documents my lord my lord the issues in this case are fairly straightforward whether of fact or of the law the plaintiffs' claim is really for the value of certain caterpillar spare parts that were stolen by a conspiracy of two of their employees and two other persons from the outside the conspirators finally sold all the stolen goods that will be our case to the defendants and the defendants themselves and that will appear from the various documents in the bundle or documents my lord sold to unknown third parties some of those parts which were stolen the last instalment which was stolen was recovered by the police who were alerted by the plaintiffs and they laid a trap and caught the culprits red-handed and that last instalment valued at about one hundred and sixty thousand dollars was recovered by the police and returned to the plaintiffs it will be the evidence of the plaintiffs my lord that the total value of the lost articles is approximately five hundred thousand singapore dollars and we will lead evidence as to how we arrived at that figure and alternatively damages so the issues are fairly short and they are as follow my lord firstly in purchasing the stolen articles from the conspirators and subsequently disposing of them if the defendants converted those goods that's the first issue in law were the goods converted by the defendants if so what were the value of those goods now going through my learned friend's bundle of authorities last night my lord we noticed that they are going to run a defence of purchase-in-the-market goods now we have ourselves gone to the point and my learned colleague mister loh chai chong has done some work and he would like to make his submissions on the law on that point my lord with your lordship's permission now if i may at this stage just introduce the bundle of documents the first one is the bundle of pleadings my lord which consist of the statement of claim and the defence has your lordship got it  plaintiffs' bundle of documents volume one  no my lord it's on the pleadings my lord bundle of documents lodged pursuant to order thirty-four rule three point six that's the one yes that consists of the statement of claim which is in very short form and the defence my lord which is also in relatively short form before i deal with the statement of claim my lord i'll deal with i'll introduce the other bundle of documents as well we have two plaintiffs' bundle of documents in two volumes volume one and volume two  volume two is described as supplementary bundle  that's right my lord bundle of documents volume two now my learned friend has got two documents defendants' bundle of documents volume one and volume two now quite a few of the important documents are repeated in both bundles in other words plaintiffs' bundle as well as the defendants' bundle my lord and at some stage both my learned friend and myself we'll get together for the purposes of agreeing so that we can have one common bundle as an agreed bundle for the time being my lord he says that he wants to preserve his position as to the relevance of some of the documents in my bundle anyway now the plaintiffs' volume two supplementary bundle is not agreed my lord my learned friend says that he's going to object to it depending on the use that i'm going to put that document to that's right isn't it  that's the computer thing i refer to my lord  that's right so we won't be marking these bundles at this stage my lord thank you very much so going back to the bundle of pleadings your lordship sees in paragraph two it's been asserted that the plaintiffs were the owners and entitled to possession of the caterpillar spare parts to the value of five hundred thousand dollars and that from the period january nineteen eight-three to september nineteen eighty-three at fourteen tractor road singapore the said caterpillar spare parts and other spare parts to the value of five hundred thousand dollars were stolen from the plaintiffs' warehouse by mohamed taz khan ramachandra ng kin sai and madam liau pau all the said stolen caterpillar spare parts of the said value of five hundred thousand dollars were old and delivered by the above-named mohamed taz khan ramachandra ng kin sai and liau pau min to the defendants during the said period from january nineteen eighty-three to september nineteen eighty-three the defendants then being in possession of the said stolen caterpillar spare parts have sold pledged delivered and/or otherwise dealt with or disposed of the said caterpillar spare parts to a person or persons unknown without the plaintiffs' consent express or implied whereby the plaintiffs suffered loss and damages and they claim five hundred thousand dollars my lord my lord the defence is interesting paragraph one the defendants deny receiving the said stolen caterpillar spare parts they do not admit what's alleged in paragraphs two and thirty of the statement of claim and in paragraph three they want to say as follows at all material times the defendants' purchased they say in the ordinary course of business certain caterpillar spare parts from foreign companies situated in the united states of america europe and japan and the local spare parts dealer namely uniborn enterprise company then having its registered office at number thirty-five kallang pudding road etcetera singapore the defendants bought the aforesaid spare parts in good faith and without notice of any defects or want of title on the part of uniborn enterprise company and paid a reasonable market price for the said goods now we asked for further and better particulars my lord of these allegations and we have them my lord in a separate document my lord before i deal with the particulars further and better particulars can i ask your lordship to have a look at page forty-five on the volume one of the plaintiffs' bundle of documents my lord forty-four it's a copy of our letter of second october nineteen eighty-six addressed to my learned friend's firm in which we say we refer to your client's defence filed and served on the plaintiffs of thirteenth august having examined the defence we are satisfied that our clients the plaintiffs in the above suit are entitled to the following further and better particulars of the defence of the suit under paragraph three on the allegation made by your clients that at all material times the defendants purchased in the ordinary course of business certain caterpillar parts etcetera kindly give full particulars of the alleged purchase of the caterpillar spare parts from such foreign companies and local spare part dealers especially uniborn enterprise company as follows and there we set it out my lord paragraph one paragraph two please state from whom in particular these alleged purchases were so made and whether they were oral or written and if written identifying the document or all documents in which these alleged purchases were in point three please state whether these alleged purchases were paid for and if so paid for whether in cash by cheques or any other form of payment and four please state to which person or particular persons in such company or companies such payments were so made the answer to that letter my lord appears on the next page page forty-six it says we are instructed that our clients are long established as dealers of spare parts and have been purchasing spare parts over a long period of time from companies situated in the united states of america europe and japan the identities of suppliers of these parts we are instructed cannot be disclosed at this stage as it may be prejudicial to our clients our clients consider this information as confidential and we therefore regret that our clients cannot accede to your clients request we then made applications of court and obtained necessary orders my lord and the next stage in these proceedings appears on page fifty of that bundle it's our letter of the sixth of march eighty-seven to my learned friend's firm we refer to the further and better particulars of the defence dated thirteenth august nineteen eighty-six filed and served by you pursuant to the order of court dated fifth january eighty-seven and to the answers given to request one two three and four thereof which our clients feel are inadequate as follows in respect of items a to f in the defendants answer to request number one the defendants have not disclosed the type of caterpillar spare parts giving the part numbers and amounts in respect of each of such parts allegedly sold to the defendants in respect of defendants' answer to request number two therein the defendants have not given the name of the person from whom the defendants had made these alleged purchases it is clear from the request that the plaintiffs want the name of the person from whom the alleged purchases were made as it is very clear from the order made by the honourable chief justice on the fifth of january nineteen eighty-seven that all the requests in the further and better particulars relate to uniborn enterprise company in respect of the defendants' answer to request number three the defendants have failed to answer whether the cheques were cash bearer or crossed cheques in respect of the defendants' answer to request number four the defendants have failed to answer to which person or particular persons uniborn enterprise company such payments were so made and we asked for those further particulars and what appears my lord in that document that i handed over a few minutes ago are the further particulars that were submitted and this is what they say the answer under paragraph one my lord appears on page two the caterpillar spare parts bought by the defendants were bought in lots without identification of part numbers and amounts of each of the parts as the same were mixed with the existing and newly purchased parts from various overseas suppliers the identity of these parts cannot be obtained by the defendants under paragraph two the answer is the defendants made the purchases from a person by the name of albert and who claimed to be the boss of uniborn enterprise under paragraph three my lord the answer is to the best of the defendants' knowledge the following purchases were made by the defendants in the manner provided hereunder and they give particulars of the cheques that were allegedly issued by the defendants to albert it will appear later is mister ng kin sai of the conspirators my lord the other relevant documents that i would like to refer your lordship to in the bundle of documents are as follows my lord i think i'll start off with my learned friend's bundle and that's volume two of the defendants' bundle of documents my lord the very first letter on page eight volume one my lord defendants' bundle of documents page eight my lord it's a letter of fourteenth november nineteen eighty-three written by my learned friend's office to affirm to the officer-in-charge jurong police station in which they say my lord that we understand that your officers have arrested one mister lim chee teck i believe he's one of my learned friend's witnesses under section four hundred and eleven chapter one hundred and three for the purchase of certain spare parts and have released him on a bond pending further investigations

such behaviour at election rallies is likely to cause anxiety and annoyance and disrupt the rally or its orderly dispersal they say firm action will be taken against those who breach the peace as law and order must be maintained to ensure that all election meetings and rallies are carried out smoothly now reports from the campaigning for the election dialogue sessions by the people's action party were held at nee soon bukit timah and changi this evening rallies by the opposition were also held the worker's party held theirs at eunos for over at bukit batok a rally was held by the sdp speaking at workers' party rally at eunos grc where he was a candidate was mr wee han kim he touched on the programme of the workers' party basically it is to give you more freedom more quality of life the pap is very good at giving you the bread and butter the bread and butter issues but when it comes to the quality of life they are hopeless when you got your jobs when you got your three meals a day when you got your flat and you want a better quality of life come to the opposition we have all the ideas we can give you a better quality of life and we can give you some fun on the way and have a few laughs at the same time now they talk about the next lap they want to endorse the next lap what is in the next lap have you seen that book it's got a nice cover a coffee table book is one that you never open the cover because you got to see the inside there's nothing there there's no substance at bukit batok the sdp candidate mr ling how doong picked on the topic of increases in costs of education all of you must be aware that government have slowly converted most of the schools to independent school and of course after the conversion the fees goes up between seventy-five to two hundred dollars it is slowly beyond the reach of most of us here and uh that is not the problem  you the government is telling you very well if you can't go to independent school you can always go to the other government school but all the good teachers qualified teachers experienced teachers have been attracted to the independent school you would expect a much higher standard of living in the independent school to attract you people to go to the independent school and the university fees have been increased many times i can well understand if the government has got no money but the government has been accumutat accumulating vast surpluses every year to the tune of nine billion dollars a year and yet the government is not prepared to subsidise more for our children education at nee soon where the pap held a dialogue session the minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo said the prime minister's right to govern must be confirmed in this general election yeo: mr goh chok tong's right to govern must be confirmed in the general election and for this reason in every constituency he is the candidate the rest of us we are just supporters we are his representatives if we are comfortable with his vision if we are comfortable with his style of government if we are comfortable with the team he has brought around him then let us show it in a resounding way and the stronger the backing he gets from us the more effective his leadership can be this is the issue and it is very important that the voters of singapore in this general election bear in mind all the other issues are really technical matters but if we get this right and if we unite around mr goh chok tong then singapore's future will be secured you know really we're feeling uncertain we do not know what may happen next no one expected this coup in the soviet union and very few expected that this coup will collapse so quickly and who knows what may befall us next month or the month after when news reached singapore about the coup immediately the stock market plunged over sixty points when the coup collapsed stock market went buck up went back up again the world is too small no distance is too great it is one global village whatever happens anywhere will affect us directly and what is most important is that we are united and we work together and we have the instinct to care for each other then our future will be secure during the dialogue session residents took the opportunity to discuss issues which concern them this ranged from new identity cards the opposition's call to people to vote in more opposition members of parliament and the proposed edusave scheme p: mr goh chok tong has come up with the edusave scheme which signals the government concern over the less affordable population this is a good sign but now the scheme only catered for students who wants to take up the extra-curricular classes so obviously the scheme will only go to a group of people who may not even require the subsidy since it is the intention of government to help the less affordable why not allowed those student nuh to allow the scheme to make use of the scheme to pay for their tuition classes uh textbooks and so on and so forth that i think will be more constructive yeo: you're right i think this is the way the government will eventually go because what we do not want is to treat human beings like commodities to be produced and assembled in the production line where every product looks the same what we want is to respect each individual for what they are as individuals different and unique and for each individual to develop to the limit of his god-given potential in a sense the education system must be customised for him so education ministry's policy si to move towards greater choice for parents and then schools and teachers will then respond to the pattern of parental choice what government will do through edusave is to give to parents these kids as it were to place as they wish in a way they think will best bring up the children and invest in their potential we are starting in a limited way because the system can easily be opened to abuse but as we go along as we gain experience as we get more feedback as principals and teachers and parents think of new ways of investing better in their children then i think the system will broaden p: now there has been rumours that uh medical fees parking coupon fees and uh hospital ward charges will be increased after might be increased after the election in fact the opposition is capitalising on this issues can you please enlighten us yeo: we must not forget that the people who work to provide us these services the people who work in telecoms who work in hospitals doctors nurses attendants they're also singaporeans they're also want to enjoy six eight percent improvement in their standard of living every year so they'll have to be paid for so from time to time adjustments will have to be made but over a period of time we must try to keep costs as low in singapore as possible and indeed any economist any statistician who looks at costs in singapore basic necessities education health whatever will know that in singapore we have just about the lowest inflation rate in the whole world for the last twen ten to twenty years the lowest inflation rate in ten to twenty years that is quite an amazing quite an amazing achievement why why does the government do that the government keeps inflation rate down because all of us have our savings in the cpf and it's very important that we keep the value of the singapore dollar steady otherwise if there's inflation really it is government breaking off your savings and my savings isn't it yes of course we must expect the opposition to always harp on the negative side on the cost increases but they never mention when our telephone rates go down the technology improves they never talk about the improvement in services and most of all the increase in the incomes of singaporeans and in their assets in the old days i mean to eat two bowls of rice was a nec necessity because you work a lot and you needed all the calories but today people are very conscious you know i mean they will cut down the rice the the chicken skin they'll put aside so we have made tremendous progress and i hope that sometimes when there're irritations when you know particular fees go up that we take a step back and say look let's take a look at the overall balance sheet has life improved have we been better off have we been better off compared to other countries ten years ago twenty years ago we have done very well and what we want to do the pap government is to continue with this progress this development this yearly increase in our quality of life and in our standard of living but of course the market is not is unequal in its outcome and some people do much better off than others so the pap is committed to making sure that those at the bottom however bad their luck or whatever mistake they make or whatever problems they may face that at the bottom if they are in trouble we will help them at the dialogue session in bukit timah mr lee hgn kiang an unopposed pap candidate of tanjong pagar grc said the prime minister's consultative style of leadership isn't something abstract he gave two examples of how it affects people's lives in concrete ways kiang: nowadays when we develop plans at the ministries or the departments we take special care to consult the people who are affected by all these plans i can give one example even when we develop parks we now bring the plan of the park to the people and say, "" this is what we are developing are you happy with it"" and we are surprised with the results that comes out for example we're developing a neighbourhood park and the residents say, "" look we have a very active qi kong group here hundred members why don't you change the park a little bit so that we can have our qi kong practice in the park instead of uh in the in the field between the blocks uh so we mange to do that and they're all happy the the park is is served the the people better and the people are happy that they are consulted and they got concrete results in the development of the park in the last few years we've also stepped up town councils that is another very concrete example of how the prime minister's new style has led to a change in the way we run things in government this is in fact the seed of local government being planted and it will evolve more participation more consultation more decisions devolve down to the ground so when the prime minister put his leadership style as an issue in the general election please understand that this is not something that is abstract this is going to affect all our lives in very concrete ways sport the pan-pacific swimming championships in canada world champion american jeff ruse has clinched the second

military presence will continue regardless of the outcome of the philippines bases issue britain too has reaffirmed its long-term commitment to the five power defence arrangements saying it's not linked to its presence in hong kong and iraqi officials have handed over their nuclear documents to an un weapon inspection team ending an earlier dispute over the matter the us says its commitment and military presence in the pacific will continue regardless of the outcome of the philippines bases issue the visiting vice-chairman of the us joint chief-of-staff stressed that such a presence is viable even without a base like subic in the philipines admiral david jeremiah said although there are plans to adjust the composition of us military forces changes in the pacific will be modest admiral jeremiah said nations have attacked for too long the idea that the us presence in the pacific equates directly and only to the philippines he pointed out that the us has ship repair facilities in many places there are also several areas where the us can support and sustain military forces admiral jeremiah has said the position singapore took two years ago in working towards a memorandum of understanding with the us to provide facilities was a foresighted and thoughtful approach this has led the way for other nations to do the same he added the us continues to enjoy excellent relations with singapore it values the cooperation between the two countries as well as singapore's open and strong support for a significant american military presence in the region the us is also proud of its role as singapore's partner in helping to ensure peace and stability asked if there would be more exercises between the saf and us troops admiral jeremiah hoped these could be continued and perhaps increased he would like to see joint exercises with the involvement of naval and ground base aviation as well as amphibious and army forces he felt it was in these areas that troops can understand how to work with each other admiral jeremiah on a three-day visit as part of the regular series of consultations the us holds with its allies in the asia pacific region britain has reaffirmed its long-term commitment to the five power defence arrangements the british defence secretary mr tom king says the commitment is not linked to its presence in hong kong he assures singapore leaders that the fpda has relevance now as well as after 1997 when hong kong has referred to china mr king said the fpda which involves britain australia new zealand malaysia and singapore is an insurance policy on the possibility of expanding the defence arrangement to include brunei mr king said it is for singapore and malaysia to see how the fpda could develop he said having a wider security arrangement in the region does not conflict with the fpda as an insurance policy he said his current visit to the region notwithstanding very significant developments in other parts of the world is a measure of the importance britain attaches to the region while there are no imminent danger to countries in the region mr king said potential sources of conflict could arise he cited the claims made to the ? ? islands as an example of possible problem areas mr king who was here on a three-day visit as part of his tour to the region left for brunei this afternoon iraqi officials have handed over their

this evening's campaigning for the general election four parties are now holding rallies the pap is holding a rally instead of a dialogue session this evening at eunos grc the workers party is holding two rallies one in hougang and the other in bedok grc the singapore democratic party is campaigning in braddell heights and nee soon central and the pkms in ayer rajah at a workers' party in hougang dr lee siew choh its candidate for eunos grc said there's no democracy in singapore when you talk about democracy you would allow people to hold small meetings together discuss political issues of the day so that you know they can exchange views and maybe make suggestions to the government but in singapore you are not allowed to do that if you speak up and you speak up against the government they may take action against you therefore it becomes very difficult for people to gather to talk about things many people have a lot of views they discuss it behind the scene they talk it in their rooms in their family circle between friends in club maybe but if you were to ask them to come out openly and identify themselves with the opposition they have to say they dare not therefore in singapore today there is an atmosphere of fear and this atmosphere of fear we must try and get rid of everybody must help to get rid of this fear at the sdp rally its candidate for braddell heights said the pap has been lucky so far in nineteen sixty three the pap dominant dominating the whole of the political environment of singapore now there are such reason there there were reason for that where we know we understand because at that time it's a turbulent world not only that singapore is in trouble where poverty unemployment but the whole world is such you look and recall in nineteen sixty in india in china they are not as good as today so the whole world has progressed progressed over the thirty years so the pap they are in a way very lucky that they are in power for the last thirty years and when they talk about the achievement of today in singapore they said this is achievement by us by pap not by you i think that is absolutely wrong without the support without the hardworking of the people no government can success speaking later the same rally the party secretary-general mr chiam see tong says it is wrong to believe that the opposition does not support the good efforts of the pap the pap has always try to make it a bad picture of the opposition they want to always make it as if the opposition wants to stop progress it is absolutely not true we are singaporeans we are in the opposition why? because we are concerned for our country therefore it is wrong to say that we want to hold back progress it's absolutely not true in fact if the government does good things we will say yes please do more for the people we should not say because it is done by pap no no no good we don't want if the pap wants to build hospital here we said okay please go ahead build one more we don't mind if they get the name for it because it's good for singapore it does not mean that because it is done by the pap we say it's bad we are constructive we are supportive of all good cause and in fact it is our duty to make sure the pap do only good for singapore the singapore malay national organisation pkms held their first rally this evening in ayer rajah candidates touched on the racial harmony the rising cost of living and criticise the next lap its candidate for jurong mr word said the publication did not have what he called soul it's in the next lap you must word  scrutinise it and understand it then you will see some thing emerging a monster and a frankenstein so that is why we demand that uh if the pap are sincere we demand to know who are the office of the next lap and we demand to know what books of references they referred to when they compile this book and we demand to know the sources of that knowledge name your books the pap name your books of reference and you will be rest assured that we dare probe into the sources of their knowledge but with the caution of our soul at the pap rally in eunos the prime minister mr goh chok tong took to task the workers' party mr jufrie mahmood for mixing religion with politics he said mr jufrie's been making communal and religious insinuations and word definitely agitating the malay ground by speaking only in malay in the hope that chinese voters won't know what he's saying mr goh cited several instances when this was done at workers' party rally last week mr jufrie accused his pap opponent mr sidek saniff of selling out the malays and of attempts to buy the malays mr goh said in the last election mr jufrie also attacked pap malay mps repeatedly for taking a moderate line and working in co-operation with the pap government to improve the lot of the malays instead of taking a confrontational stance i'm happy that jufrie has come up openly with his position yes sidek saniff supported the tertiary scheme proposal he was in the forefront persuading malays those malays who can afford it to give up the privilege of free university education he wants them to pay and he wants the money to be given to mendaki to help the poorer malays and this policy is not sidek's policy it is my policy i suggested it our policy is right because our policy is aimed at making the malays help themselves so that they can compete with the chinese and indians and at the end of the road they can do well and they can claim that it is through their own merit and ability that they are able to stand tall now as for separation of religion and politics sidek saniff believes that politics and religion must not mix it is too potent a mixture if you mix politics with islam you allow buddhism to be mixed with politics you mix politics with christianity then that spells for trouble so he's speaking out of his heart when he supports the separation of politics from religion but jufrie says that is wrong he wants to mix religion with politics well you try and do that in singapore you are going to end up with a big fire right away just look at india look at sri lanka where politics are mixed with religion what has happened in india what has happened in sri lanka will happen very quickly in singapore if we mix religion with politics january nineteen eighty-five i was appointed deputy prime minister you can trace the record between nineteen eight-five and now to see what we have done to fulfill a promise in that document word nineteen ninety-nine mrt we've got it today indoor stadium we said we we would build it we have built it town councils we have got them hdb refurbishing on the way pilot projects are now being done in six areas so that program is on the way mendaki formed mendaki one mendaki two i said we should form a special committee to help the malays mendaki two has been formed and now we are going in for sinda to help the indians and after we have helped the lower income indians after we have formed sinda we are going to form a development assistance committee for the chinese there are also poor chinese don't think all chinese are rich in fact there are more poor chinese than poor malays and indians put together so we will focus our attention to help the lower income chinese if i succeed in forcing a bond with you i meet you at dialogue sessions once in two weeks after election i go down i give the meet the people face to face there is no need for opposition and if pap leaders become arrogant please give us a knock on the head no it it is possible that sometimes ideas get to get into our head if there are very few opposition members in parliament it is possible that we become complacent we become a little swell-headed i say it is possible for myself i don't think that is possible i cannot change but assuming that it is possible you will be our safeguard you will be the people who will check us the pap the government are now big enough to accommodate a range of views in our early days we would not tolerate dissenting viewpoints we were like a samphan and we believe like a samphan you cannot allow people to tussle to quarrel on a samphan because the samphan will capsize but today i believe we are more like a big boat the bottom is flatter it is very flatter very like a ferry you see like a ferry correct like a ferry thank you that's what i meant by participation of the people i did not have the right word or the right metaphor but the idea grew forth ferry yes on a ferry we can we can accommodate a range of opinions and i have allowed encouraged people to air their opinions now you read the straits times you read sbc you watch sbc people now criticise the government they come up with alternative ideas opposition are free to criticise us i said go ahead so long as we know that certina areas are off limit like language religion race so long as we keep away from these areas it is alright you can criticise my program you can criticise my style you can offer a better style a better program i accept and if ideas are good i co-opt them again which is why the opposition has not come up with any ideas first i think they are incapable of coming up with ideas and if they have to help us to govern you know what i will do i will co-opt their ideas so in parliament if in parliament or outside they do come up with an idea to help me govern singapore better i will say thank you very much mr chiam i'm going to implement it and if i do that my government will become better say my government becomes better by nineteen ninety-six there'll be no chance for mr chiam polling will take place this saturday and the counting of ballot papers will be carried out at eight centres anderson junior college eastview secondary school jintai secondary

Singapore	 3 jan ' 90  good evening the main reports tonight the land transport select committee recommends ways to control car growth the philippine government gets more powers to investigate those suspected of involvement in last month's coup attempt and the politburo of rumania's communist party is arrested we begin with a report by the select committee on land transportation on ways to control the car population one of its major recommendations is the introduction of the quota system to ensure a target car population growth rate is maintained the chairman of the committee dr hong hai explains we think the quota system will work better because it set it attains the target directly it says four percent six percent growth whatever and uh allows the market price to adjust to attain that level of growth there are possibly some misapprehensions about what the quota system will lead to but first is the idea that somehow the quota system is going to prevent many people from owning cars this is totally untrue under the quota system you could also go and buy a scrap car or you could scrap your car and with the certificate you get buy a new car so that doesn't change at all what has changed is what price you pay to buy a new car when you don't have a scrap car to trade in right in the past the price is fixed at the arf value in the future if the quota system is implemented the price is going to depend on market conditions at that time we've advocated and i think it's most reasonable that the government would would would uh go along that the quota should not be something that is very secretive or very confidential the government should be quite open to to allow people to understand its rationale for whatever quota it is going to set whether it's five percent six percent three percent whatever let people know well in advance what it's likely to be so that there is no uncertainty in the market so that dealers cannot go out and spread rumours that oh next year it's going to be zero so you better buy your car now that sort of thing we don't think therefore that the the government uh should be we think the government should be open about it and therefore speculation arising from uncertainty of the quota in the future would be minimum the committee also said the present parf scheme should be retained for all existing vehicles but for newly registered cars the scheme can be refined so that cars disposed of earlier will get a better value as for the evening area licensing scheme the committee has asked for it to end half an hour earlier at six thirty it also suggested further studies on the effectiveness and need for an evening als on parking charges the committee said the rate should reflect the social word the city and congested areas but car-park prices in housing estate(s should not be determined by traffic control objectives as it had only a minor impact as for public transport the committee believes there may be a case for granting capital subsidies to feeder services for the mrt it also said improvements for road transport should continue to meet the people's aspirations to own cars a special program on the report by the select committee will be telecast after the news on this channel singapore's trade rose in november last year it grew by nearly eleven percent compared with the same period in nineteen eighty

snorkel a volunteer of the civil defence force some exciting displays are being planned for the singapore armed forces military tattoo it's a three-day event that starts on the twenty-ninth of next month and it promises to have just hair-raising stunts ever wondered how it feels to jump off a thirty-metre tower that's exactly what the commandos will be doing during the nineteen-minute military tattoo each of them will be doing a free-fall repelling from these light towers with coloured smoke coming out of their helmets they'll dive straight from the top without a parachute and only a rope to hold on to the main difficulty besides the height is the wind because being up so high the wind is pretty strong and this will affect the repellers when they're descending so they have to uh spread out their bodies to stabilize themselves so as to come down uh in a in in a steady manner so that's one factor but uh with constant practice they should be able to overcome overcome this and what are some of the safety measures being taken to start with he has his safety helmet his safety goggles now of course he has to put on a pair of leather gloves these are the standard repelling gloves which he use protects his hands from getting burned and gives him better grip on the rope then he has his uh harness which he sits into to which it's attached a carabina and this device which is called figure-of-eight descender this is quite an important safety device because first of all it aids him to in doing his braking so when he brakes the figure-of-eight the way it's configured slows down the descent and stops descent completely meanwhile when he's descending freely this figure-of-eight descender enables the rope to glide freely to give him a smooth descent and that's just one of the highlights of the tattoo if you're interested to go tickets will be on sale from tomorrow at the saf nco club the safra club houses and tangs department store and here's a piece of good news for those in the fine arts the substation a multi-disciplinary art centre will be ready by september dancers actors artists and sculptors where they're just starting out or established will soon share a common

ubin and its wooden rural community centre reminds youth pioneer of koh kok weng of the cc he started in jalan besar sixteen years ago at the beginning when we started organize activities for youth it was really an uphill task first of all the condition there is not really conducive as there's no attraction and most of the youth do not know the existence of the pa youth movement so we got to launch an house-to-house campaign to publicize the youth movement so they come to know about it and to keep them coming the popular activities of that time were introduced activities like weight-lifting sepak takraw and table tennis which are still popular today but with more members joining the movement in the late seventies and early eighties there was a need to offer more varied activities and the late eighties saw social service getting more important as a sense of community grew the youth members learned to how identify social problems and even solve them in the future youth leaders will also be meeting and mixing with youth leaders from other countries more often to exchange ideas and to learn from each other but the sea's where the action will be more and more of the adventurous and independent youths of today are expected to go into sea sports and perhaps even more will try to put singapore in the map like these canoists they'll try to break the present record by forming a raft with three hundred and fifty canoes this sunday

of education in a country improvement of primary level education will be the subject of discussion at the schools council meeting tomorrow the labour ministry and all its departments will be relocated to its new premises at havelock road from the sixth of next month with the move it'll make some changes to the work permit procedures the work permit department now at princep street processes

for consumers from october current import rules for rice will be relaxed and importers will be allowed to buy all types and grades of rice the trade and industry ministry says the change will come with the introduction of labelling regulations all rice bags will have to carry information on the type of rice grain composition net weight and brand they must also have the name and address of the importer or local distributor with the labelling and liberalization of uh imports of rice consumers will have an advantage in that they can make informed choices the price of rice will not increase because uh labelling costs are only a very small proportion of the cost which consumer will pay uhm i think with this labelling there should be greater variety for consumers to choose from as an importer we will benefit by diversifying our sources of supply and i think this is a good business practice as a retailer we would be able to offer more variety to our consumer and at the same time offer him lower prices the wishing singapore well has helped raise more than three hundred thousand dollars for the twenty-fifth anniversary charity fund the latest contribution came from staff of the

Singapore	 20 december 1990  good evening the soviet foreign minister resigns in home news the select committee of the elected president bill proposes amendments in its report in parliament the government has decided to promote the use of unleaded petrol and to give the building authority greater powers to deal with squatters and the acting minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo calls for confidence and optimism in our effort to promote asian culture parliament began today with the swearing-in of the two newly appointed nominated members mr leong chee wah and the associate professor morris choo they'll serve as nmps for a period of two years parliament today also heard details of plans to introduce unleaded petrol for use by cars from july all imported petrol-driven vehicles will have to be able to use unleaded petrol and from january nineteen ninety three all new petrol-driven vehicles will have to be fitted with catalytic converters in a ministerial statement the environment minister dr ahmad mattar also reveals that from the first of february there'll be a price difference in favour of unleaded petrol the tax on unleaded petrol which is more expensive to produce will be reduced from fifty percent to forty eight percent from february while for leaded petrol an additional tax will be levied to make it about ten cents per litre more expensive than unleaded petrol this means that if the current pump price for leaded petrol is one dollar nineteen cents the new price in february will be one thirty four for leaded petrol and one twenty four for unleaded petrol it was also announced that from july nineteen ninety one all petrol-driven vehicles imported for use in singapore will have to be able to use unleaded petrol dr mattar said in the meantime the ministry will work with oil companies and motor traders to advise motorists on whether their cars can switch to the use of unleaded petrol and all companies have been very supportive of this switch and said it was a logical extension of the ministry's long-term goal of a more environmentally conscious society there are at present about three hundred and thirty two thousand petrol-driven registered cars on our roads and about ninety percent or three hundred thousand cars are able to switch to unleaded petrol the remaining thirty two thousand cars which are mainly cars older than seven years cannot use unleaded petrol and most of the motor-cycles on our roads can also use unleaded petrol dr mattar explained that in singapore the main source of lead in the air is from vehicle emission although the lead content in our air is well within safe levels our car population is growing and if the lead content in petrol is maintained at current level the growth in car population will result in rising lead levels in the air which can have damaging effects on health the ministry has assured the public that it will not be stopping the sale and use of leaded petrol since about ten percent of the cars in singapore will still need to use leaded petrol and from january nineteen ninety three there'll be stricter emission standard for all new petrol-driven vehicles they will need to have catalytic converters to convert harmful hydrocarbons and other gases to safe ones like carbon dioxide nitrogen and water but dr mattar said because catalytic converters will be damaged by lead present in leaded petrol they cannot be introduced until after unleaded petrol becomes widely available and is used in singapore among the bills passed by the house today with the building control amendment bill it gives the building authority more powers to deal with unauthorized structures especially those built by squatters on private land in moving the bill's second reading the national development minister mr s dhanbalan said by the end of this year squatters will be cleared from some three hundred and fifty lots of private land all over singapore and by nineteen ninety two some four thousand seven hundred squatters on state land and more than one thousand five hundred on land managed by the malayan railway administration will also have to go the government had in nineteen eighty set a target of ten years to make singapore squatter-free much has been achieved up to october this year the government has cleared more than one hundred and fifty thousand squatter cases on state land however mr dhanabalan said the heaviest concentration of squatters is found on land along the railway track malayan railway authorities have tried to clear these squatters since nineteen eighty six but they've not been very successful mr dhanabalan said many of these structures are make-shift huts erected without permission and are dangerously sited on both sides of the railway track they are safety hazards potential fire risks and blights on our environment for those who have to be relocated today will be the cut-off date to qualify for resettlement benefits those who move into the squatter areas after today will not qualify for the benefits it's costing the singapore government thirty seven point five million dollars in the word instance to pay for compensation and clearance the malays in government has agreed the cost will be recovered when the authorities returned the land to singapore the first phase of the clearing from kampong silat to upper bukit timah road will start in january while the second phase stretching right up to woodlands is expected to start at the end of next year the government has given the assurance that this will be done with as little dislocation as possible the amended bill also sets out new procedures for enforcement actions the building authority will be able to serve the demolition order and either the owner or occupier of the building previously it can only serve the owner it can also order the closure of an unauthorized building this means the occupiers will have to vacate the place for demolition to proceed those who fail to comply can be taken to court and made to pay the full cost incurred for removing the structures mr dhanabalan also moved for a second reading of the architects bill and the professional engineers bill he allow registered architects and professional engineers to team up with allied professionals to form multi-discipline partnerships and limited liability companies the bills have been referred to a select committee during question time the senior minister of state for foreign affairs brigadier-general george yeo told the house the first deployment of us naval and airforce personnel in singapore begins in march next year some ninety five of them can be expected on a year-round basis and a further seventy five on as temporary basis parliaments adjourn to the third of january more details of the day's proceedings will be telecast in this channel at ten pm singapore should promote asian cultures and values with confidence and optimism says the acting minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo says cultural influence follows economic strength and as the economies of eats and south-east asia develop so too will their cultural influence on the rest of the world in all of history there is a strong link between economic performance and culture and so we see japanese management culture following japanese capital into america and into europe and it is japanese cul management culture which will in the end revive many industries in particular the automobile industry in america and in europe and not far behind japan are the nies and the countries of asean and behind them there is china and there is vietnam general yeo was speaking at a seminar on the social role of singapore newspapers in promoting asian cultures and values he said singapore's national debate on cultures and values must be set against the larger historical backdrop of the changing dialogue between east and west and we must avoid self-doubt and pessimism in promoting asian cultures if we proceed from an inferiority complex then the likelihood is that we will become extreme and we will over-compensate and we will not be rigorous then we also become petty and narrow-minded and there's no reason at all for such pessimism there's no need for chauvinism of any kind east or west and east and west have now to learn from each other of course word needn't reminded us that east and west have always learnt from each other and from a historical perspective what we are really seeking is a new synthesis of east and west which raises human civilization to a higher level so in the end we must not forget the wise words of confucius 'si hai zhi nei jie xiong ti' that within the four seas all men are brothers coming up in a while the economic development board says the chemical sector grew by fifteen percent last year and its likely to maintain this healthy grow rate in nineteen ninety investments

Singapore	the japanese then the french and afterwards with the cambodians and the chinese and of course among themselves in fact this is the first year of peace in vietnam for almost half a century when you're so used to war peace can be strange and it's stranger still when you stop to think about what vietnam is really doing today after half a century of fighting and getting rid of foreigners vietnam is now asking them back to help it win the peace unlike before there are now frequent international flights to hanoi but before you set foot in vietnam it's easy to put labels on the country we think of vietnamese as aggressive people hanoi a heart of hard line marxism and the place so oppressive that people had to flee in boats but the capital is not like that at all there may not be many cars but almost everyone owns a bicycle and like many cities there are people and people hard to believe that this is the country of war for decades from which the boat people fled in such terror today the vietnamese are evidently at ease with each other and strangers too especially strangers who carry us dollars we're told that vietnamese are proud people but pride evidently has to take a back seat when the local currency the dong is practically worthless if you buy anything in dong you need a brief case for the notes and for anything expensive this counting machine comes in handy everyone wants us dollars an irony that leaves the visitor wondering how complete vietnam's victory over the us was and for most vietnamese ho chi min is still the man who liberated the country from american imperialism yet the present leaders are ready to invite the americans back and end the trade embargo impose since the end of the vietnam war in 1975 but the apparent inconsistency stops here when you're finally settle down talk and work with the vietnamese you'd realise how simple and practical their approach is there is none of the psychoanalysis or the academy award winning movies of war at least not yet more vietnamese die in the war than all the foreigners combined and the wars were fought on their soil the warning of the dead continues with the help of an interpreter we visited the home of a tailor do ding fong has been sewing since he was sixteen today at sixty he leaves most of it to his son giving him more time with his one hundred year old mother tailoring brings in about four hundred and fifty thousand dong a month which is only about forty us dollars it's difficult to get by especially when he has in-laws staying with him there is at least enough rice to prepare for everyone his mother receives twenty-five kilos of rice a month from the government she has lived through all the wars and her son ding fong's brother was killed in dian bian fu another family and the same philosophical attitude singapore's senior minister visited vietnam last month the way the vietnamese show their grief he feels has a lot to do with their culture travelling down from hanoi to the south and you get the distinct feeling that you're entering modern vietnam everyone tells you how fast ho chi min city is developing into a business centre the signs that greet you when you arrive confirm it there is indeed an unrelenting celebration of private enterprise here and why not after all this was saigon where people were businessmen by instinct despite the name change there is still plenty of evidence of the old saigon many still call the city by its old name vietnam today is a wash with the mood of doi moi or renovation their version of perestroika the call for reform in the economy started back in the early eighties although the real turning point came in 1986 when vietnam swung its door open to foreigners today economy liberalisation is not only encouraged it is also ideologically correct  word is an advisor to the present government a harvard economist he was acting prime minister of south vietnam between 1965 to 66 vietnam he feels is in a state of transition but what the politician wants to do sounds good but what vietnam is remains very far from what its leaders want it to be these veterans fought for their country in the name of communism and nationalism and what's more they won but the country has made a mess of the peace that followed vietnam is easily one of the poorest countries in the world today by every measure from clean water to sewerage to electricity vietnam has been sinking while the rest of asia has bloomed the great majority of the population live in acute poverty ill-housed undernourished and underemployed the shock of the transition from communism to capitalism exacerbated the miseries of the old order the population is now approaching seventy million people more than twenty per cent are without full-time employment for some of them scavenging on the margins of the market fills the vital gap between hunger and starvation lenin lingers in vietnam as a forlorn reminder of what went wrong in fact it is an irony that this statue still stands while the one in lenin was destroyed when the soviet union self-destructed the disappearance of the soviet union and the eastern block countries had been hard on vietnam whose economy had relied heavily on soviet aid today with no aid and no communist markets for vietnamese exports what is left is a heavy and unwanted soviet legacy this is just one of six hundred similar relics of soviet inspiration clap out equipment and products that can't be sold like all other heavy industries unless they can turn in a profit by the end of the year they're finished no more state subsidies this company is working hard to improve the quality of these piers hoping to sell them to western europe now that the communist markets are gone the managers must learn not only to in turn a profit without government help but must begin to pay its workers more and pay taxes to the state otherwise the private industrialist may take over  word who is now a special advisor to the communist party's central committee was one of the main advocates of the reforms in the eighties he admits that duplicating the soviet model has been the main cause of the country's failure and how long will it take for the vietnamese to get into the capitalist load of thinking but not everything from the old order will need to be erased in fact education under the socialist government has proved to be unusually successful today even when vietnam compares so miserably with other third world countries in almost everything it is one of the most educated countries in the world with more than ninety per cent literacy this is no mean achievement especially when you consider the turmoil war and revolution had caused for historical and nationalistic reasons the vietnamese do not like being too closely with the chinese but it's not difficult for the visitors to see chinese influence in vietnam the buildings their language even their approach to work in fact the current reforms in vietnam reflect the changes in china as far as agriculture is concerned many believe they have taken off in fact vietnam has always been a fairly successful agricultural country until farmers were made to chase the communist dream peasants had been forced into collectives private property was outlawed and land owners persecuted the result while the population grew food production fell it got to such an alarming point that the collectives had to go but not fast enough to stave off the threat of mass starvation just four years ago today these farmers know that the situation can become very bad but they won't starve they're free to farm on their own account output has soared making vietnam the third largest rice producing country beyond that it's clear that there is no quick fix to an economy plagued by decades of communism the years of waste are clear everywhere for the eye to see and it gets worse when you start to get down to the system or in this case the lack of it people say it's a lot better today but the infrastructure is still desperately inadequate electricity could go off for up to four days roads are few and built mainly for bicycles despite the liberal foreign investment laws the bureaucracy can be maddening it's a place for business only if you're very patient and there are no real banking or legal supports in the way modern businessmen are used to mr word works for a foreign company in ho chi min city he knows the problems only too well when everything came down from the top controls had been crucial now that the economy is moving away from that the cracks are beginning to show the man in the street may be able to do his bit for private enterprise by selling whatever he has for a profit but to overhaul the entire system into an outward looking business entity it's altogether a different matter there simply aren't the right people with the right knowledge at the middle and top to carry this out this is where the foreigners must come in in a big way two years ago vietnam opened the world's first floating hotel it remains the only five star hotel in ho chi min city but it's a start in getting foreign expertise and hard tourist dollars in the service industry is only one example of investors testing the waters more substantially the cheap labour and rich resources such as oil and gas are attracting the taiwanese koreans and other asian investors in big air loads by the day that vietnam is virgin territory with a big potential market is just one reason for them to take the plunge for many asians and western investors vietnam has become part of their asian diversification plan keppel shipyard in singapore was one of the earliest pioneers back in the mid-eighties they negotiated contracts with not just the vietnamese but there soviet advisors as well today keppel is in vietnam providing infrastructural support from equipment for oil rigging shipyards and even backing support what vietnam needs is clear ideas and money to do things and to do them differently old ideas have proved useless and old friends are now gone the new friends are more important they're richer and the new ties do not come with political conditions it's strictly business but how would the vietnamese best use these ideas and money this exchange of expertise is starting within vietnam but with changes there would be other areas that the government would need to look into when almost everything is up for grabs you can encourage the wrong types in those interested only in a quick buck leaving the vietnamese to pick up the crumbs like all third world countries in a haste to modernise the social effects may not always be easy to control in 1986 the government allowed youngsters into dance halls it might have been against the socialist way of life but it reduced the crime rate today this is a common sight in ho chi min city and the clubs have introduced other acts to lure their guests back some of these acts can get just a little hot by bangkok standards this may seem tame in ho chi min city it's a walk on the wild side and it gets wilder and wilder when you know where to look and it's only at the beginning the invasion of the foreigners hasn't happen in a big way when the us embargo was finally lifted vietnam can expect more investors and more social change  but for now washington's seventeen year old embargo on trade and aid to vietnam has an effect place the country off limits not only to the us but its powerful allies as well 
Singapore	" goh chok tong's national day rally speech 1998  we are in for some very tough times the currency crisis started in thailand in july last year it then spread quickly to the rest of the region in some countries the financial and economic problems triggered off social and political upheavals the turmoil has gone on for more than a year now but the end is still not in sight matters are likely to get worse before they get better we must prepare ourselves for a gloomy scenario continued difficulties in the region will mean minimal growth for singapore over the next 1 to 2 years we need to be realistic about the prospects but there is no reason to be despondent we have the resources and resolve to withstand the external shocks we do not have the weaknesses of the badly affected economies but we need to organise ourselves to weather the storm and use this period to gain a head start for the race ahead after the storm has subsided steering through this storm to safety is singapore's biggest challenge since i became prime minister eight years ago fortunately i have a capable and steady team of ministers permanent secretaries and senior civil servants but they cannot do this job by themselves they need your co-operation and support to succeed  genesis of the regional crisis  let me go back to how the regional crisis started and how we got sucked in  thailand  thailand was one of the new economic tigers last year in june when i visited thailand the signs of trouble were there though they were not yet obvious i saw scores of magnificent new buildings many unoccupied in bangkok there were large tracts of newly-prepared but vacant industrial sites at the eastern seaboard the thai baht had run into trouble in may the ministers could not agree on how to handle the problem on the last day of my visit prime minister chavalit hosted me to a golf game along with his finance minister amnuay virawan during the game chavalit whispered to me that he was trying to persuade amnuay not to resign later i spoke to amnuay he confirmed that it was true he had held back his announcement out of courtesy to me immediately after the golf game amnuay met the press to announce his resignation thai companies had borrowed too much in us dollars they spent the money on property projects which earned thai baht not us dollars this was all right provided the projects were sound and the baht exchange rate was stable unfortunately both assumptions turned out to be wrong many of the projects were not sound the property boom had become a dangerous bubble thai banking supervision was weak nobody stopped banks and finance companies from risky lending in fact many lent to their owners relatives and friends as the thai economy weakened the baht became over-valued fund managers and currency speculators saw an opportunity they bet that the baht would go down and sold the baht short the bank of thailand spent us$20 billion in a futile attempt to defend the thai baht eventually it ran out of us dollars and gave up the thai baht immediately depreciated by 17 percent to 29 baht per us dollar today the thai baht is 42 baht to one us dollar down by 42 per cent when the baht fell companies which could not pay back the us dollars went bust foreign lenders recalled their loans thai banks and finance companies were left with huge amounts of bad debt and became insolvent the whole financial system was shaken the economy almost collapsed thailand had no choice but to call in the imf  contagion  the thai collapse scared investors and bankers who had invested or lent money in indonesia south korea and malaysia they rushed to pull back loans and investments the rupiah won and ringgit went down like the baht their economies came to a sudden halt malaysia did not have huge foreign debts but its domestic debt was large nearly twice its gdp many foreign investors had invested in malaysian shares when they lost confidence in malaysia and sold the shares the kuala lumpur stock exchange crashed many companies had borrowed heavily from banks against their shares their collateral was reduced to a fraction of the value they had pledged to the banks the companies became insolvent the banks' non-performing loans went up dangerously high singapore companies on the whole have not borrowed excessively whether in us dollars or singapore dollars our banking system is sound but the singapore dollar also went down against the us dollar although by less our economy is so interlinked with our neighbours that their problems inevitably affect us when latin america was hit by a financial crisis in 1994 investment analysts called it the "" tequila"" shock that crisis had originated from mexico well known for its punchy tequila for the asian crisis they called the contagion the "" tom-yam"" effect but the tom-yam soup was very spicy unlike the tequila hangover which went away after one year the tom-yam effect has remained now some call the crisis an asian flu but the strain is apparently resistant to the antibiotics prescribed by the imf  indonesia  what has happened in indonesia is a major tragedy the rupiah today is worth only one-fifth of what it was against the us dollar last june the banking system has almost collapsed the economy is expected to contract by 15% this year 90 million indonesians nearly half the population are living below the poverty line that is on less than s$30 a month 40 million face the threat of starvation the may riots will put indonesia back by many years the indonesian chinese minority community bore the brunt of the violence media reports have drawn international attention to what happened hundreds of internet websites are carrying "" yellow ribbons"" to demand justice for the victims of what is widely believed to be organised lawlessness many indonesian chinese and foreigners fled indonesia in terror some have not returned others went back only to salvage what was left of their businesses but not to rebuild or re-invest tvri showed retailers selling their wares outside burnt-out shops  wong kwei cheong's story  the indonesian tragedy struck home vividly when i learnt of what happened to wong kwei cheong our former mp for cairnhill after leaving nus he poured his energy and capital into investments in indonesia he started several factories in indonesia with a japanese partner to produce tvs video cassette players and other electronic goods he did well and built up a chain of distributors like most companies he borrowed foreign currency to finance his investments in indonesia his products were sold in indonesia he borrowed at about 2 500 rupiah per us dollar at 5 000 rupiah he could still survive but beyond that it was impossible his distributors owed him money they could not repay and offered to do so with their shops i advised wong kwei cheong against taking over the shops i told him "" you will lose them there will be social unrest"" that was in february he said that he had no choice also he intended to build up his own chain of shops to distribute his products unfortunately i was right many of his shops were looted and burnt he has suffered a severe setback but he will bounce back i have confidence in him  a singaporean victim  i also received a letter from a 65 year old retiree recounting how a close relative a singaporean suffered the same fate during the jakarta may riots his relative a young entrepreneur had built up a sizeable food distribution business in jakarta "" after tears and sweat for five years"" as he put it on 14 may his relative's two super-markets two coffee houses a bakery two warehouses an expensive "" cold room"" three freezer trucks and a car were looted and set on fire his home was also broken into and stripped of its contents the retiree wanted the government to know that there were singaporean victims of the may riots and that charity should begin at home  helping indonesia  i feared the worst for indonesia when the crisis started that is why i visited then president suharto three times i also spoke to president clinton prime minister hashimoto prime minister john howard and chancellor kohl i impressed upon them the seriousness of the indonesian situation and urged them to help we tried but alas we failed all of us pinned hope on the imf solution in restoring investor confidence in indonesia on hindsight we should have tried harder to get president suharto to understand that signing the letter of intent with imf was only the first step and that results would show only 6 to 12 months after he had fully implemented the imf conditions senior minister and i knew that president suharto was not happy with some of the imf measures we suggested that he appoint paul volcker as his adviser to intervene with the imf paul volcker is a former chairman of the us federal reserve board with a formidable reputation he would have had the standing to argue against the imf the imf would not lightly dismiss volcker's views nor would the market lose confidence if indonesia followed volcker's advice instead of the imf's paul volcker was approached he visited indonesia but decided not to take up the appointment he must have found the task of helping indonesia too difficult given the government's policies at that time we have a vested interest in indonesia's stability growth and prosperity it is our close neighbour and a major trading partner we have more than s$4 billion of investments in indonesia in batam bintan karimun sumatra java and elsewhere our banks have another s$4 billion in loans to indonesia an indonesian collapse will hurt us besides scaring off investments from the wider region singapore will help indonesia within the limits of our ability we are a small economy our gdp us$82 billion is a mere 1% of the united states gdp  us$8111 billion and 2% of japan's gdp us$4190 billion) it is only one fifth of australia's gdp us$395 billion) we are not in the same class after all we are only three million people just a little red dot on the map where is the capacity to help 211 million people whatever we do within our means it should make some real difference to indonesia we pledged us$5 billion to help indonesia along with the imf in november last year to show confidence in indonesia mas also participated in joint intervention to support the rupiah exchange rate unfortunately the intervention was overtaken by events and failed we still have several trillion rupiah deposited with bank indonesia  the trade guarantee scheme  singapore is giving humanitarian assistance to indonesia beyond that our best and most practical contribution now is not to finance indonesia's budget deficit or food subsidies through the imf but to help indonesia restart a part of its economy which has stalled foreign banks have stopped accepting letters of credit issued by indonesian banks we tried to help with a guarantee scheme we sought the support of indonesia's major trading partners for a us$20 billion multilateral trade finance guarantee scheme i wrote to leaders of the g7 plus a few other countries from their replies it was clear that most preferred to have their own bilateral schemes and be in full control of their own funds at the request of then president suharto and his economic ministers singapore subsequently offered its own bilateral trade finance guarantee scheme btfg to indonesia using the us$5 billion pledged under the second line financing package with the imf we put up our proposal to indonesia officials from both sides held one meeting in april the indonesians took the proposal back to study they commented that the scheme had too many safeguards singapore has no experience at all in trade finance guarantee schemes safeguards are necessary to prevent unscrupulous traders from abusing the scheme through fraud and cheating  this would not only defeat our objective but harm the reputation of the scheme and further erode confidence in indonesia we are taking advice from experienced international institutions like the world bank or the exim banks of the big exporting countries to learn how to improve on our proposals without losing discipline and control guaranteeing trade transactions in an unstable environment is a risky business the indonesian newspapers recently reported that a syndicate of 12 indonesian banks had been cheated of us$18 million in a trade financing scam the banks only discovered that the imports were fictitious when the company concerned failed to make payment "
Singapore	this is where public housing is going in the future sin ming court bishan west with its distinctive word walls and roofs sin ming court offers one of the latest designs in hdb public housing for the housing and development board it will need upgrading more than of the six hundred thousand flats all over singapore over the next ten to fifteen in the 1960s the hdb launched it called its home for the people scheme today with most singaporeans owning hdb flats housing is no longer an urgent problem instead many are eager to upgrade into bigger and better flats about half of applications for recently built flats are existing hdb flat owners to help residents to become comfortable and familiar with their surroundings to stay put instead of moving out into a new neighbourhood and community the government's introduced a programme in 1989 to upgrade older housing estates to about the same standards found in the newer estates the upgrading exercise is one of the most farreaching measures in public housing sally word and her husband ricky moved into this new estate in hougang from whampoa a distinct feature in the new estate is that a few blocks of between three and eight are grouped together called a precinct each precinct is marked by artificial boundaries such as link ways this organisation of precincts will be phased into older estates under the upgrading programme it's designed to give residents privacy and that extra sense of belonging to ensure wider choices and variety in design private architects will be invited to take part six precincts have been selected and will be upgraded within the next two years to show just how the programme can make improvements these demonstration precincts are ang mo kio neighbourhood three another at the marine parade estate lorong lew lian and telok blangah each will have its own demonstrations with the other show precincts at clementi and kim keat they spread all over singapore so other hdb owners can easily get to them in these precincts dialogue sessions have been held since the concept was introduced towards this end the government works closely with grassroots leaders and twon council members participation in the project is voluntary the demonstration project is expected to be launched sometime this year however the majority that is at least seventy-five per cent of owners in the precinct must be in favour of the proposals before the project can proceed residents in the each precinct can provide feedback on the type of changes they want through their grassroots leaders and town council members upgrading of older flats is a new concept in singapore however its been introduced in other countries with a large number of old buildings the hdb has been studying the upgrading programmes in japan and france the improved environment as a result of upgrading is expected to bring about a more cohesive and caring community but how does it work we'll take a look at the new estate of bishan as in many other new estates most people in bishan east come from older ones all over singapore here they build a new life the focal point of their many recreational activities is the part in the centre of the precinct all the amenities the playground multi-purpose court and landscape gardens have been integrated into the park eileen lim moved her home to bishan with her parents four years ago eileen's a student in canada but now on vacation in singapore for eileen there's a feeling of home despite there being about twenty thousand flats in the estate perhaps the fact that the estate's broken up into smaller areas helps to build a sense of belonging among residents the open area used in many older estates for parking cars here becomes a garden the different themes of the estate lend distinction and contrast to other areas like bishan north identified for its different perspectives colours and design or bishan west better known as sim ming court come evening the neighbourhood comes alive with its own activities for chandran meeting his children at the playground has almost become a daily ritual every tuesday night residents meet at the basketball court to get to know one another better that's aside from the entertainment on other nights they go ballroom dancing or their children practice tae kwan do like chandran many people feel a growing sense of pride in bishan the upgrading of older estates will give residents greater opportunity better amenities and a higher standard of living as in bishan it will nurture that sense of pride so that residents will refrain from littering and vandalising their own property chief architect tony tan and three other hdb architects work for the upgrading of kim keat lorong lew lian and ang mo kio while the other three precincts marine parade telok blangah and clementi will be designed by private architects for all the six precincts the resident gets a package of benefits there are three components in the package within the flat there will be an additional space of about six square metres it may be a utility space a service balcony at the kitchen or a front balcony and then conversion of window frames to aluminum type for those who already made changes there'll be improvement work on the fittings and fixtures such as internal doors or refuse chute hoppers with self-locking devices the upgrading programme can help flat owners many of whom have already renovated their flats to improve their surrounding making better use of common areas such as a surface carpark and void decks in a meeting between the town council the hdb and the architect with residents of marine parade prime minster goh chok tong he's also an mp for the marine parade grc said the improved environment is expected to increase their network of older estates to ensure that the project runs smoothly the hdb launched a pilot programme early last year the board's to refurbish several big blocks of flats at teban gardens and woodlands no one will need to move out of his flat during the refurbishing period which is expected to be about two to two and a half years instead of hacking the existing structure the dry technique and precost method will be used as much as possible in order to reduce nuisance level how much one can endure the noise dust discomfort as well as the safety and security aspects are being carefully monitored and studied by the hdb feedback from occupants of flats under this pilot programme is constantly sought in order to help the hdb keep inconveniences to the minimum at the same time visits to newer estates such as pasir ris has been organised by the hdb in order to make the plan clear to residents in the demonstration precincts they were shown features that could be incorporated under the upgrading programme which indeed have already been introduced here in the meantime residents committee members have been actively carrying out surveys among residents in the identified demonstration precincts the idea is to ensure that at least seventy-five per cent accept the proposals of their architect and town councils for those who may find it difficult to join the programme due to financial constraints there's a loan scheme to help them the cost of upgrading each flat is about forty-five thousand dollars which includes provision for future fluctuations in material cost and inflation for the demonstration projects the government will finance ninety per cent while owners pay only ten per cent public support is vital for the success of the upgrading programme with rising expectations among singaporeans there'll be changes in lifestyle we spoke to those living in the precincts identified for the demonstration project the new look that comes with the upgrading programme will be displayed in special exhibitions to be held at the six demonstration precincts residents will have opportunities to examine the proposed upgrading packages for their precincts the hdb will lead in the upgrading exercise of these older estates but it will be the owner flats together with their town councilors and grassroots leaders to determine their surroundings a singapore transforms itself into a modern city state  for the indians gandhi stands as a symbol for many things and among the tenets of gandhi philosophy is the belief that education is a great leveler in society is a belief that mister isheran word would like to instill in indian singaporeans he spearheads the sinda task force that wants to change the dropping educational standards among indian singaporeans the challenge that sinda faces is to close the educational gap between the chinese and indians by the year twenty ten fortunately sinda has found ready support among in the indian community the president of sinda mister j y pilay told friday background why this is so necessary some indian singaporeans seem to have lost the drive to excel instead they're satisfied with minimum education and low-paying jobs this attitude is seen in one particular social strata more than the others not surprisingly then the performance of indian students is lagging behind the national average on in four indian students will drop out before getting a psle certificate only twenty-eight per cent of indian students taking the 'o' levels qualify for jc among the chinese forty per cent of those taking the 'o' levels will enter jc and only twenty per cent of indian students taking the 'a' levels will enter universities or polytechnics the better educated are taking the lead in pulling up the educational standards of the community less than six months since it began working on this goal sinda has a number of projects in full swing and the office is a hype of activity mister tegeraj word as operations manager has his hands full making sure everything is running smoothly he works closely with suma the coordinator of the tuition programme which started in january although they both started here as volunteers their interest in sinda led to them staying on as full-time staff but sinda can't live on enthusiasm alone they need three point seven five million to run their education projects now with the amendment to the cpf bill past last week sinda will be able to collect money through a monthly contribution from all indian employees employers will automatically deduct employees contributions from their salaries these are the minimum rates that have been agreed on an opting out scheme for those who don't want to contribute has been worked out this puts the pressure on giving and it's something which could lead to negative response among some but mister ishweran who worked on the details of the amended bill feels that this will not be too much of a problem sinda's latest and most extensive projects so far are these tuition classes science and maths have been identified as areas of weakness for many indian students so along with english these subjects are taught three times a week by qualified teachers using materials from the ministry of education it's only been five weeks but already the effects can be seen in tuition hungry singapore the response has been overwhelming especially when classes cost only twenty-five dollars per month so far two thousand four hundred students are enrolled in these classes but by keeping the classes to fifteen students sinda teachers have been able to give more individual attention to each pupil it's this individual attention that haridas like about sinda's tuition classes he's not really a bad student but for the last year he's not been doing well in mathematics now with the extra help he's getting at these tuition classes he feels that he's improved and that this year's results might be better and if there's no tuition class it's home to a session with mum mrs shanta more than willing to spend her time studying with her son because she believes very strongly that parents are instrumental in how well their children do in school  sinda knows that fighting for the future cannot be done without help from the parents children who learn the importance of education and knowledge from a young age will be more motivated to do well an through their parent outreach programme sinda's trying to make sure that this happens with the formation of groups like sinda the beginning to turn more to community self-help in order to right what is wrong as those who have succeed reach out to the less well off in the community perhaps there will come a time when gandhi's vision may become a reality for these children 
Singapore	alvin is seventeen he used to cycle out even if it were very late whenever he had problems with his parents five years ago alvin was sent to boys' town his parents felt that they'd lost total control over their son and this boy felt the same way too after damian's father passed away four years ago it became difficult for his mother to keep track of his activities he used to come back at odd hours today damian comes back only on alternate weekends the rest of his time is spent at boys' town he's been there for ten months now one reason for this problem is that not enough time is spent with the children but then there's little choice money needs to be earned and food needs to be put on the table about nine in ten of the kids at these homes come from lower income or single-parent families with the extended family becoming less common today it's meant that while parents are out working the child is left to his own devices many may not have taken a wrong turn but some have left alone they're free to do whatever they want with whomever they want many parents have lost control and in desperation have put their children into homes like boys' town they hope that the change of environment and a more structured lifestyle will instill discipline and councilors like irene loy see to that but not in the way many people expect there's no unnecessary caning or severe punishment and discipline means following a fixed schedule for meals study games and housekeeping it's rise and shine at 0640 hours and lights out at 2200 hrs but discipline alone isn't enough to smoothen the rough edges these boys need practical skills and a sound education to give them a boost when they leave boys' town thirty of the seventy-six boarders learn a trade at boys' town vocational institute the remaining forty-six attend assumption english school which's next door and study with a thousand others students but how do these students feel about their classmates from boys' town but unfortunately acceptance remains confine to those who study teach and play with the boys to study together to share their problems thoughts and hopes this is what the home has come to mean for these boys so after a while being there doesn't seem so bad there's a feeling that there're all in it together and change is also a key word at the haven this home run by the salvation army takes in children from families with problems but they're younger between ten to thirteen years to protect them from prejudices we're even told not to show their faces the haven hopes that by reaching them at such a tender age the child will be able to escape a vicious circle of problem families john nickelson has been a social worker for over thirty years now and he gave producer silvan poi his views so the approach is that residential care should only be the last resort but sadly there are parents who have pushed the responsibility to the home saying that it can take better care of their child and that's where the teen challenge crisis care can help the home services are temporary shelter for troubled teens many who are runaways and that's the aim for all these homes the eventual reconciliation of the family unit although not all cases are success stories those that do make it are much better for the experience after five years alvin's relationship with his parents is much better now he can talk to them it's also his last year in boy's town and his outlook on life is clearer he wants to go to the temasek polytechnic to study graphics so how does he feel about boys' town now so there is hope for damien he's just beginning to feel the change in himself being at boys' town only ten month he still got some ways to go but he is more tolerant of his mother now and he's finding out that there's more to life than just doing what he wants to do  four times a week for the last three years david wee has been attending a private law school he's a full-time student and will be taking his exams this june it hasn't been easy studying law on his own but then david didn't have much of a choice and going abroad was out of the question like david almost half his classmates are striving towards the same goal to be a lawyer but for various reasons they're not doing it the usual way through the university all are however serious about achieving their dream but it's an uphill struggle for them for some are able to do it full-time many aren't as fortunate peter ong is one such person he's a second year external law student from another private school but time is a luxury they can't afford the external degree they're working for now is recognised only up till nineteen ninety-six for admission to the bar which is what qualifies them as a lawyer after nineteen ninety-six too bad a law degree yes but no hope of actually becoming a lawyer in the report published by the committee for the supply of lawyers the members said we do not accept that the holder of the external degree is comparable to the holder of a llb nus degree and the reason for this they feel that external students aren't in university because of their lower a level qualifications and because they aren't in university they wouldn't have benefited from what the committee calls an intellectual environment which conduces to a deeper and better understanding of the law and its role in society in other words the committee believes that because external students did not go to a proper school they won't make good lawyers and the course david sought isn't that much different from what students in uk universities are doing in fact it's the external programme conducted by the university of london it's a three year course with exams at the end of each year the only difference external students can study at their own pace and only sit for each exam when they feel ready so they can take anything from three to eight years to get a degree but even so the exams they take will still have to meet certain standards s kunalan a former external law student has a masters degree with distinction from the university of london and he's been teaching external law students for eight years another words the university expects the same standard from both its internal and external students that's not all passing the basic degree exam is one thing but it doesn't qualify them as a lawyer they still have to sit for the english bar exam and this they can't do if they get anything less than a second class lower honours and to make things harder the pass rate at english bar is less than thirty per cent chandran mohanair is a partner in a law firm and vice-president of the law society he agrees universities can produce good law graduates but more is required whether or not external law students are of lower calibre than university students is debatable but what's clear however is this external law students have to pass a basic degree exam which is similar to that taken by uk students and all of them also have to pass the same bar exam so surely there's no reason to assume that every external law degree holder is inferior and what's more to carry that assumption so far as to deny them the chance to prove themselves classes may be over for the day for these students but for david that only means it's revision time after all he has a deadline to beat  established one hundred and seven years ago acs the best is yet to be striving towards an all-round education reaching the mind the heart and even the soul every aspect of the school is planned and built towards making sure that the boys are given the most and the best right down to little details that make school feel like home each student pays two hundred dollars a month which sure helps a lot in getting the school on its feet and going the school has an administrative staff of seven clerks four secretaries one bursar two vice-principals and one principal all to manage the massive paper work logistics and plans necessary to keep the school in fighting shape and this is certainly a relief i'm sure to the teachers some one hundred and twenty-eight of them who can now at least concentrate on what they do best and most of these teachers are graduates hand picked by the principal himself i dropped in a class of boys revising for a geography exam this ratio of one teacher to fifteen students certainly makes teaching and learning a different experience all together and you wonder where are the exercise books in this set up each student gets individual attention and it's refreshing to see how on the spot learning of mistakes take place also the students learn how to interact with each other all within the cool and conducive environment it means word whole culture or group sharing and learning is simply a way of life in the school beauty and the beast now this secondary four class was learning reading and comprehension skills in a fun well funny way so each class at whichever level is the same yet different because teacher and pupil are allowed to experiment and come up with new ideas from whatever way so long as learning takes place yes a lesson in stress management for these fourteen year olds and the boys tell it all this is all part of a pastoral care programme that looks after the boys' emotional needs it also prepares them to face the world like an adult and confront problems with each other and who wouldn't be able to build up his confidence if you've to stand in front of your friends just about everyday in almost every class the essence of education the molding of each student's character and what better way than through enrichment programmes so that he finds within himself something he likes something he knows is uniquely his something to show the world who he is and the chance to create and be spurred on to do even better so after almost one year of teething problems acs not unlike the other seven independent schools has began to start a standard of education which i believe is going to be a tough act to follow simply because of its whole support system in terms of its funding alumni teaching and non-teaching staff also the school has complete freedom to plan and chart each student's future now all these things are absolutely crucial in ensuring the school's strength and success so can autonomous schools match up well so far details released by the education ministry on autonomous schools show that they'll remain as either government or aided schools funding the government will give them seven hundred thousand dollars more for an enrolment of fifteen hundred students this is to help them introduce new enrichment programmes school fees will be between fifteen dollars and thirty-two dollars teachers will still come under the ministry but principals will have more say in selecting who they want on their staff they can also hire new staff for enrichment programmes and support services and as far as class size is concerned that will remain the same the education minister had also said autonomous schools would be more like an intermediate grade of schools between independent schools and neighbourhood schools many principals like mister tan teck kwee from victoria school welcome this idea however some parents while they welcome the setting up of autonomous schools believe we shouldn't expect too much out of them  and doctor gwee ee hian and academic consultant sees yet another reason why autonomous schools may not match up to their independent counterparts well what does the education minister think well one thing for sure for parents like lawrence teo autonomous schools is a welcome choice  
Singapore	doctor edmund monterio has met counselled and treated almost all ninty-nine people who have the aids virus in singapore he knows only too well the tragedy that aids brings he's seen victims as young as twenty-one die from the disease struck down even before their prime for many the suffering wasn't only in death but also in the lonely wait for it what started out as silent hiv infection is know now full-bloom aids for richard his family still doesn't know that his immune system has broken down and now even a common cold can kill him like many other victims richard thought it could never happen to him official aids awareness programmes have been set in motion but with relatively few people infected the disease seem far removed this doesn't make aids any less real one can carry the virus for years but not know it and with each sexual encounter the deadly virus gets another chance to claim a new victim it's also not unusual for victims to be unsure who they got the disease from this is the thailand we are familiar with but in this land of smiles aids has reached epidemic proportions eighteen year old noi has been working here for just over a year her monthly test for hiv have so far been negative but like thousands of other thai prostitutes noi has a seventy per cent chance of getting aids and passing it on from the estimated two to four hundred thousand thais infected with hiv virus the future is a hospital like this until two years ago twenty-two year old suti spends most of his night at patpong one of bangkok's famous night spots in search of a better life he left home and family in impoverished north-east thailand but a few years later he tested positive for hiv he's been here since ten other young men share this ward with suti all are being treated for symptoms related to hiv infection they do not yet have full-blown aids and are sent home when the symptoms clear doctor soomsin has seen over five hundred patients in the last four years sixty have since died from the disease like elsewhere the victims are no longer just drug-users or homosexuals aids has states its claim on heterosexuals here the government estimates that by the year 2000 one in three deaths in thailand will be of aids this frightening spectre has raised much public concern and thailand has never done more to braised itself for the worse one of the government's first steps was to approve the set-up of this clinic believed to be asia's first anonymous clinic it runs test for the hiv virus but such as the stigma of aids that for the clinic to be effective it also promotes itself as a place to test for hepatitis b and syphilis for those who come because of aids are counselled they're also advised on safer sex and how to cope with the disease the main drawing point is that the patient doesn't have to give his name to ensure that the test are kept confidential he's only known as a number since the thai red cross opened it five months ago this clinic has seen about fifty people coming everyday more are being planned as it's proven to be a turning point for many despite this promising start and the efforts to maintain anonymity it may take more to convince the thousands who need to be reached these performers from a group called empower bridges that gap to break the ice humour is often used to give the message of aids prevention across and it's aimed not just at bar-workers but also at their patrons the work of empower however goes beyond these night performances it also runs a drop in centre for the bar-workers so when they're not practising for the next performance some girls come here for counselling as well as english lessons for those who had picked up the language english has been their passport to better jobs as well as loads of self-confidence and it's largely through efforts of people like chantawepah arpisok that many bar-workers may just escape the clutches of aids the director of empower she started reaching out to the girls as early as 1985 there are still quite a few places where empower isn't welcome but even if they're given the go ahead the message of safer sex doesn't always go down well one person who has been supporting empower is twenty-three year old sudawan she's a mamasan to the girls here at rafifi in the patpong district but it's not always that neat some girls who refuse to appear on camera told us that condom or not they must get more than four clients a month or have their salaries deducted and with business down from the aids scare the girls may not have the luxury of being selective there's another problem though the girls have never been more familiar with the safer sex message they aren't always convince that it's necessary chiangmai known for its pristine scenery has also been scarred by aids more than five thousand hiv cases have so far been detected but unlike bangkok it's had better success in promoting condom usage twenty-seven year old lim has worked in this brothel for three years she was recently recruited by the health authorities to teach the other girls about protecting themselves through lim and others like her condom usage has been effectively enforced but it wasn't easy convincing the girls this firm stand may just save lim and many others wherever condom usage is enforced fewer new hiv cases have surfaced but still one in eight prostitutes are believed to have the aids virus those who have it continue working those who don't continue to be at risk to stem the spread thailand is determined to curb the vice trade minister michye word  a bill now being considered by the thai government aims to prevent under-aged girls from going into prostitution if passed severe action will also be taken against those who force or trick girls into the trade to deter more from being lured into prostitution for the money the government has joint hands with private companies to adopt villages and offer the women alternative employment but curbing the vice trade is just part of thailand's bigger fight against aids this is a village crematorium in chiangmai some months ago relatives of one aids victim refuse to attend his funeral fearing contaminated air the villages even stopped another cremation from taking place frightening myths continue to surround the disease the unwillingness to come to grips with it has also led to ignorance which aids feed on many still think of aids as someone else's disease this attitude is changing but slowly the chiangmai university hospital is one of the major hospitals involved in the treatment of aids but unlike the rest it made sure that the aids patient is not isolated so if he has a cold he'll be treated along with the others with the same ailment but the majority of thais still feel that aids has nothing to do with them a recent survey showed that eighty-six per cent of thai men believed that there was very little chance of ever getting aids complacency is not only widespread in thailand but also in singapore many continue in activities that puts them at risk of the ninety-nine identified cases here almost half are heterosexuals many of them who contracted the virus claim they got it from prostitutes here or overseas but as in thailand the prostitutes themselves face an even higher risk despite this many who've come here do so for the same reason but some may get more than they bargain that's the reason why leaflets like these are handled out to them during check-ups arranged by the anti-vice enforcement unit such checks have so far found thirteen thai prostitutes hiv positive all have since been sent home but because the aids virus can lie dormant and undetected for months these check-ups though regular could mislead the women and their clients telling them that they're clean when actually not the women themselves are aware of the need to practice safe sex but often they have to give in to their customers but it's a gamble even teenage prostitutes are willing to take detection of aids is even more difficult amongst them as they operate independently so far the aids virus has spared this group of singaporeans but it may just be a matter of time as surveys have shown that teenagers are becoming more sexually active without taking the necessary precautions against pregnancy venereal disease or aids and with aids now spreading within the heterosexual community any teenager or adult engaging in casual sex runs the risk of being infected places which hold the highest potential for sexual encounters may well become areas where the aids virus next lurks so one needn't step into the back main alleys of brothels to get aids the risk are of course higher but it's not confine to sexual contacts with high risk groups like prostitutes in fact it can now be transmitted within the home this one year old thai baby may not live beyond six months she has the hiv virus abandoned at birth euwan word was born to an infected mother who caught the virus from her husband thailand is now facing the problem of aids babies and so is singapore this is a tv ad warning the thai public about aids singaporeans will soon see local versions but the fight against the encroaching shadow of aids goes beyond awareness it is now a choice every individual has to make  when the publicity agent of cameron mckintosh incorporated offered me a free trip to new york to watch the actual broadway production of les miserables i told her please i have no time for all these i'm very busy well i lied welcome to new york i'll be watching the world's foremost musical les miserables but not before in the sights and atmosphere that make up this remarkable cosmopolitan city everything you've read and heard of new york is true but nothing quite compares to actually being there to experience its people places and culture walking down broadway is an event in itself that removes any doubt on new york being the creme de la creme of world class musical entertainment and enthusiast the world over queue up daily at times square for tickets to broadway musicals as early as six months to a year in advance tickets for les miserables have been sold out for every performance since its opening in nineteen eighty-seven this score-boarded time square is a constant indication of the number of people world-wide who's seen les mis to date the late alfred hitchcock once said to a friend after reading victor hugo's literary masterpiece les miserables that book will make a wonderful musical and he wasn't wrong the les miserables recoup its four and a half million us investments within twenty-three weeks of its opening and with a production cost of over four million les mis authentically pronounced les miserables is the empire state building of musicals each production requires a crew of over one hundred the cast include forty-two performers some of whom play as many as twenty different characters four hundred costume changes are required involving more than one thousand six hundred pieces of authentic nineteenth century costuming fifty wigs are used throughout the three and a quarter show all handmade with human hair and not to mention the extensive staging and use of sound lighting electronic and electrical equipment a seemingly unstable stage that can accommodate up to twenty people and a rotating stage floor ingeniously gives pace to the musical that requires clockwork precision but even the most talented of broadway performers needs that special guru to select and draw out that talents from within an executive director of cameron mckintosh incorporated richard jay alexander has been that driving force since nineteen eighty-five  so what's the point of this story the point is i've just seen a spectacular musical and the same cast including the director will be going down to singapore to perform for you next february so why come to broadway when broadway will be right at your doorstep at the kallang theatre miss les miserables and be les miserable sponsored by dbs bank and singapore airlines tickets will be available from all sistic outlets from the twenty-first of september 
Singapore	the flow the fabric the beauty of fashion mystic magic glitz glamour the world of clothes has it all it's the world of thieves to be controlled from new york milan and paris ladies word are ambassadors for the great fashion houses but the catalogues of singapore are also travelling apart to the top of fashion world but amidst the applause there's still a long way to go local labels are making their mark but only locally there's still a wide world out there where singapore designers must boldly go or get behind in the race but to get there how does singapore designers offer that special touch thomas wee has been in the local fashion business for more than twenty years now he's gone international selling his designs in japan he's trying to capture that distinctive look but so far overseas opportunities have been few but what can be done to use the familiar heritage we have to advantage designers in the past have tried to incorporate the different ethnic styles into one and recently we have the singapore dress with orchid motifs for one young designer who gets much of her inspiration from chinatown khee tries to bring together east and west fusing together new and old khee is looking for designs which have that distinctive look she spends hours searching for that special something perhaps surprisingly it seems local fashion isn't as vibrant as it looks but how do you feel the pulse of the international fashion beat it's more than just looking inwards shaping a fashion business is all about people it can't be done alone but putting together the right theme seems to frustrate most local designers the unanswered questions are trained workers and backup there's a feeling that there's not enough response to the demands of the industry in fact there are now courses in marketing but they're very new the la salle international fashion school runs classes especially for the industry with the help from the economic development board students learn the rudiments of fashion retail all aspects of the business and above all how to sell marketing the cornerstone of fashion and a solid business base but a designer still needs ideas so la salle emphasizes good designs getting that good design is a painstaking business and it's vital for students to get that hands on experience the idea of practical training seems to have grabbed many it's a crucial new trend for would be fashion makers after all they're the industry's leaders of the future and hands on training is a start in the establishment of singapore as a fashion training centre for the asia-pacific from cutting room to cat-walk the young designers have a lot resting on them the future of the whole industry this is a traditional way of looking for bargains in fashion accessories soon there'll be a way of looking for the new fashion trends as well that's when the fashion resource centre opens this year unlike the present situation buyers and sellers will be able to do business in a more conducive atmosphere at the moment getting the right fashion or design is mainly a question of luck the same is true where it comes to textiles often singapore buyers are a season behind their choices while the best are often illusive this sort of deal goes on all the time in the textile business but it's often time consuming and mostly expensive for the buyer so plans are afoot to establish singapore's own fabric centre becoming recognised internationally that's what esther tay aspires to be she's just returned from tokyo where her collection was exhibited along with big names like ungaro and tierry mugler it's a difficult to penetrate and she has to take into consideration the preferences of the japanese while esther concentrates on the design her husband paul helps to market her clothes and there are ambitious plans to sell a total boutique concept to american retailers with the number of orders coming in thick and fast how's the company going to manage actually going global is a big step to take but right in the heart of london that's where one singapore designer has decided to take on the best of britain in fact the operation was so successful that within a year a second celia loe boutique is being planned how did celia succeed and what are the problems faced in making inroads overseas to satisfy the discerning taste of her clientele celia churns out nearly ninety designs a month to stay one up she has gone high-tech her patterns and measurements are all done with the aid of a computer however celia believes in that personal touch despite a tight schedule she supervises a team of cutters and seamstresses to ensure the right quality but this operation is an exception some feel that to make an impact overseas singapore has to identify itself as part of the asean group to wear fashion like this you have to be young and you have to be young to think of the designs the asean young designers' contest throws up the best in the region and it does something more it's a channel of expression making asean countries together and maybe singapore will be refocused to attract asean designers to set up base here last year's winner from the phillipines won a scholarship to study at the la salle international fashion school in the mean time local fashion makers are grouping together to create an impact style singapore a joint effort by the local fashion trade is a retail outlet which showcases some sixty local designers some fledgling others more established style singapore is modeled after london's exclusive birlington arcade and it hopes to be a showcase of singapore fashion designs to catch the eye and they're mainly from younger designers who come out of school and display their wares these represent the first step to sell singapore fashion abroad another idea is to sell the rights to a singapore label overseas si-ann was the first to launch its singapore range as normal styles launched in october last year si-ann is the first singapore retailer to go global through franchising at the moment it's concentrating on the regional market malaysia indonesia brunei and thailand but its eventual aim is to go completely international the idea of franchising was supported by the trade development board their intention is to look at different ways of going global at the moment singapore has attracted many international labels but what could make it really exciting is to get the designers too and generate more ideas but even if we could attract a top fashion master like yves saint laurent to singapore there is still some apprehension the local industry is experimenting with different approaches as it's also looking for that very distinctive style while it may takes some time to develop that distinctive singapore style the ground is being laid for fashioning a niche  caroline ng lives with the fear that one day come an emergency she'll have to receive donated blood from the blood bank caroline is just one of several people i've talked to who've raised concerns about getting aids from donated blood and it appears these concerns have some basis you see our blood bank does test all donated blood for diseases including aids and these tests are well-known to be very stringent but the problem is these tests are not full-proof especially so with aids and that's because of this fact for a period of between three to six months immediately after you've caught the virus you won't be able to detect it no matter how well you test for it this is what doctors call the latent period or window period the virus remains hidden and won't show up in any test and according to doctor koh kwang poh a g p who's been in practice for twenty-eight years this is where the danger lies so it would seem that the best way to make sure that donor blood isn't infected with aids is to keep it in the blood bank until after the window period is over which is between three to six months and then test the blood one more time if the blood passes the second test then should it be used but this isn't being done i found out that our national blood bank only keeps blood for up to forty-two days which isn't even two months i asked the blood bank why they don't make an allowance for this window period they told me they can't keep the blood for so long because red blood cells die after forty-two days and warm blood can be frozen it's not practical to do so because it takes too long to get it ready for use in an emergency but if that's the case caroline wants the right to choose another option what caroline is talking about is a process called directed blood donation an option provided overseas and this option has its advantages according to hematologist doctor toh king keat however our national blood bank still stands by its policy they will not provide directed donation simply because a patient ask for it according to them one reason is that blood transfusions between close relative donors and patients raise the dangers of fatal graft versus host disease this disease occurs when you take blood from someone biologically related to you like your siblings or parents but studies show that chances of the disease occurring are less than zero point one per cent and it can be eliminated if the donated blood goes through a process called irradiation there's another reason why the blood bank won't change its policy and that's administration problems at the moment the blood bank handles ninety per cent of total transfusions here and under the present system donor blood is stored in the four main categories of rhesus positive and negative a b ab and o types but with directed donation things will be more complicated that's because every pint will be reserved for a specific patient and so it's up to the blood bank to make sure that each pint goes to the right patient naturally this would mean more administration problems and paper work for the bank but doctor koh feels that shouldn't stop the blood bank  do you like shopping well i love it and like a lot of other singaporeans there's nothing that attracts me more than a big sale so it's no wonder that almost anywhere we turn we're bound to see a sale sign it doesn't matter if you're in a neighbourhood shop or in the heart of orchard road well here in the people's park complex i counted about forty shops to having sales that's about one-third of a total number of shops here well having a sale is one thing but whether you are really getting a bargain is another here's a shop in the complex was holding its annual sale and it claimed all items have been discounted by twenty up to eighty per cent let's find out what the deal really is unfortunately halfway through my interview with the salesman our camera ran into some technical problems and while we're trying to fix the camera the salesman actually tore the tag off and put a new tag on one that said sixty-nine dollars this is what happened when we continued the interview now i came to this came shop last week and the price then was seventy-nine dollars so if there was really a pricing error as the salesman claimed then why wait until now to change the price and anyway on this other pair outside the shop it still says seventy-nine i also checked the price of this same model in different shopping centres and at most places they were selling it for about sixty-two dollars but i found this shop in the raffles city area which was selling it for fifty-six and it wasn't even on sale  so even assuming that the first had made a pricing error its supposed sale price is still what other shops charge normally and what was worse this seems to be a very common practice among shopkeepers i checked with a few more shops and one in geylang was selling it cheaper and it wasn't even on sale and it's not only small outlets that are guilty of holding so called sale even big department stores do it so it's clear some shops are deliberately missing the word sale and consumers are being had is there anything we can do about it albert tan is with the consumers' association of singapore and that's the way it is in other countries in germany and belgium for instance the law only allows shops to hold two sales a year the winter sale and the summer sale and these are real sales because they have to display old and new prices oscar kusi belgium's trade commissioner to singapore explain how seriously the belgium government takes this law closer to home even stores in malaysia have to get a permit before they can reduce their prices and there's a time limit imposed on the sale so would it help to have a similar law here? the consumers' association of singapore seems to think so 
Singapore	hi i'm lisa welcome to hey singapore as singapore develops many physical traces of the past are slowly being erased hdb flats have long taken over kampongs and large expanses of parks have replaced the swamps and forests yet despite the changes modernisation haven't totally removed all the traces of the past traces of the solitary tombs for example scattered throughout the island are single and sometimes totally abandoned tombs tombs like this one here at monk's hill and another at radin mas who are buried here and why haven't they been removed tonight on hey singapore the mystery of the solitary tombs look hard enough around singapore and you may come across solitary tombs some of these are well-known and well documented like this one here at outram road it belongs to tan tock seng and for years it has remained undisturbed another solitary tomb that is slightly more well-known can be fond here at fort canning as to whose remains it holds well that's a bit of a controversy though it's believed to be iskandar shah's last season we dug up some facts about this tomb here at stevens road and we put to rest the much believed rumour that it held raffles' mistress' remains and tonight we go in search of more solitary tombs our search led us to yet another solitary tomb in the monk's hill area this is where monk's hill school is located but little is known about how the place got its name perhaps it was named after a monk who may have once lived in this area or for a temple that may have once stood here we headed to the present temple in the area perhaps someone here could shed light on a rumoured old temple unfortunately the caretaker was not around to answer our questions next to the temple was a mechanic's workshop and one of the staff there led us to what he believed to be the remains of a person who may have stayed in the old temple it was an abandoned tombstone that was surrounded almost wrapped by a tree we couldn't make out the inscription on the tomb nor can we find any clues that might tell us of the tomb was connected to a temple that was said to exist in the area hence the name monk's hill nobody at the workshop could tell us more so we looked for the owner of the plot of land the address was 147 bukit timah road but our search came to nought we were unable to locate the owner of the land or the owner of the workshop our next step was to find our tomb maker friend mr yeo he had helped us with some interesting leads with our investigation of the tomb along stevens road we hoped he will be able to shed some light on this mystery tomb as well he wasted no time in trying to decipher the characters on the stone we hoped it would tell us more about the temple that was believed to be on the hill where outram secondary and monk's hill secondary schools once stood we able to decipher four distinct chinese characters mr yeo explained that they were time references based on the reigning monarch in imperial china to pinpoint the date he would need to consult a periodical of the chinese calendar next he tried to read the name inscribed on the tombstone this proved difficult because of the tree the roots have enveloped the tombstone covering all the inscriptions but we had to get to the root of our mystery tree or no tree we tried to scratch away some of the soil that had settled in but that did not help much either slowly and very painstakingly mr yeo managed to finally uncover most of the inscribed name the first and last character on the tombstone were tan and teck mr yeo then moved on to the tomb's features to see if he can come up with even more clues in the meantime our research assistant kai lin adamantly kept trying to read the missing part of the inscription initially mr yeo thought that the granite used might be from pulau ubin where singapore's early granite came from but after further inspection he came up with a discovery that baffled us the rocks used were not from pulau ubin but from mandai which pre-dated the quarry on pulau ubin this also means that the tomb was built even before the nineteen hundreds according to mr yeo they aren't many tombstones in singapore that pre-date the twentieth century this finding coupled with kai lin's deciphering of the second character on the tombstone he spur us on mr yeo also gave us other clues as to who might be in the tomb he confirmed that it was the tomb of a male of teochew origin this was based on the outer rim marking guarding the tomb with  word markers according to mr yeo the word could also mean that the male buried here was a scholar and not a monk in the course of our story we came up with many conflicting views some said that there was never a temple on monk's hill while others not only claimed there was but that it was re-sited from newton circus and those who lived here before claimed that the whole place was nothing but a rubber plantation if all this is true then monk's hill may never have been the result of a monastery that was said to have been situated here more questions about this tomb when we come back back in his workshop mr yeo showed us the shape of a typical teochew tombstone true enough it did look like the tombstone we just saw next he showed us a chinese calendar which not only showed the years according to the word calendar correlated with the cninese zodiac calendar but also the reigning monarchs in imperial china based on this calendar mr yeo was able to pinpoint that the person buried in the tombstone died in 1873 on a subsequent visit to the temple we met an old man who live in the temple he only wanted to be known as lim he provided us more answers to our mystery but took us further from our original premise that monk's hill was named after a temple according to him the temple we spoke of was only built in the nineteen fifties where the petrol kiosk now stand was a kampong area and behind it a private garden he had never heard of a temple in the vicinity when asked about the tomb he couldn't say who it belong to but what he revealed took us by surprise under these two burned offering areas were two other tombs marked by these joss-sticks and there was a third tomb just a metre away again marked joss-sticks we speculated that these tombs could have been for those who were connected with the temple in some way but we were to be proven wrong mr tan peck chew used to be a resident of the kampong but what he told us shed even more doubt than light on our temple theory according to mr tan the temple now standing was not part of any bigger temple in the area it was moved over in the nineteen fifties from a shrine that was found under a tree at newton circus to his earliest recollection there was never a temple in the area where the school now stands it was in fact a plantation we asked mr tan if he had seen the tomb before it was covered up by the tree he couln't remember the full name of the man buried in the burial plot according to him the man was very rich and had his entire family buried in the same area the two tombs covered over by the temple was smaller tombs and were those of his two servants there was another tomb in which his wife was buried and that tomb is completely hidden by this massive tree well our search for how monk's hill got its name uncovered more questions than answers one thing's for sure this is not a monk's tomb or was monk's hill really named after a temple if so why are there no records of this temple our trace at the national archive also came to nought as none of the early maps of singapore seem to mark the presense of a temple and both mr lim and mr tan were quite sure that there was never a temple in the vicinity if it was a temple then could it have been named after a rich landowner and what are the tombstones whose was it given the grandeur of its original design could it have been the tomb of somebody influential well one thing's for certain the person this tomb belongs to was not the reason for this place being called monk's hill from monk's hill we now go to radin mas there are some stories about radin mas which apparently date back a thousand years yet others say that the actual history of radin mas only began a hundred years ago the stories that revolved around radin mas have many interpretations but the one that stands out most has to be the golden princess so it's the golden princess fact or myth this sprawling kampong was named after a tomb many versions of the forklore have surrounded how kampong radin mas got its name they range from those that say radin mas was a beautiful javanese princess who was killed while trying to save her father tun radin mas the devout muslim of royal blood we went in search of the true story of radin mas mr haji word a leader of the word  mosque near radin mas told us what he knew mr haji word account of radin mas is by and far the most widely accepted one that radin mas was a javanese princess from the word era and was killed protecting her father but there was still many questions that needed answers so we went up to radin mas' burial ground to see if there were any clues which we could unearthed the grounds was still well-maintained it was obvious that there were still people who came up to pray at this word  however we could not find the caretaker of the place some people we had asked earlier including mr haji word  told us that the caretaker was from indonesia and doesn't live here anymore others said he died but all this did not answer our questions who has been taking care of this place the tomb itself was found under a huge hollow tree and the tomb markers are wrapped in royal yellow cloth on our way down from the word we also noticed a smaller burial plot the tombstone markers was also wrapped in royal cloth we asked mr haji word who it was for we were not convinced that that was all to the story of radin mas one of her links to word  now this was recorded in the history books it was at this mosque that we were able to find new answers and a whole new story about the life of radin mas we met mr haji abu word who was the leader of the mosque like all our other leads he was reluctant at first to tell us more about the story of radin mas but after much persuasion he told us the story through our interpreter mohammed according to him radin mas was not a princess but a commoner who was a concubine of tunku word  they lived in the late nineteen century this tally with some of the historical records which tied radin mas to one tunku word who died in the nineteen hundreds they lived in the royal palace which is where the old radin mas primary school stood  what mr word went on to tell us was even more shocking radin mas was not accorded with any official status because she was a concubine that is not legally married to the tunku this explains why her tomb lies near mount faber while the rest of the royal family were buried in the royal burial plot of telok blangah road the story was a total turn-around from the other stories that we heard about radin mas mr haji word also did not recall any story of her sacrificing her life for a father 
Singapore	after a big meal your digestive system may not be able to process the excess acid produced in your stomach heartburn what appears as a minor problem can be the first symptoms of more serious health problems what happens when you lose your voice because of a paralysed vocal cord your voice what can you do if you lose it some of us use it more often than anyone else does others abuse it yet all of us need it our voice it comes so naturally that we hardly think twice when we use it but the moment we lose it that's when we will miss it most seventy-five year old madam lim had one such close encounter just this june the experience was very trying for the out-going madam lim who used to enjoy shopping chatting over the phone and even over-night mahjong sessions but all these had to go when she started losing her voice but not knowing what the real cause was madam lim kept drinking water and taking cough medication in the hope that her voice would return someday little did she realise that her voice loss had nothing to do with her sore throat but everything to do with her paralysed vocal cord madam lim was diagnosed with cancer of the lungs in june this year and within days she started to lose her voice as the tumor was sitting on her nerves paralysing her left vocal cord but for the man on the street like her how could she have known better in a normal vocal cord the two vocal folds would meet in the mid-line of the throat region and when air flows from the lungs to the vocal cords the vibrations would generate the sounds for voice production if one of the vocal folds is malfunctioning there would be a gap between the two vocal folds causing difficulty in speech as if struggling with a hoarse throat and battling with her lung cancer isn't enough she chokes on her every drink new adjustments it almost seems too much for madam lim to cope madam lim went for the scan the results confirm that her left vocal fold was indeed malfunctioning and she needed the operation to correct her paralysed cord though she resisted the idea of having to undergo an operation her fear of going mute won her over but not only was the operation simple and fuss free madam lim could even choose her voice so far word has a success rate of about seventy to eighty per cent the operation which takes place under local anesthesia simply attains results that are too good to be true a simple procedure that has brought confidence and meaning back to life madam lim has since regained her active lifestyle and was even able to celebrate her seventy-fifth birthday with dignity regurgitation of gastric juices in the esophagus who are those more lightly to suffer from heartburn find out after the break everyone eats but not everyone can experience the joy of eating some may encounter indigestion after a big feast while others experience heartburn because of a reflux of gastric juices heartburn what causes this condition patient's digestive tract will usually feel bloated after eating too much you feel as though there is a lot of gas in your stomach this results in a pain when you feel as if your heart is burning this is how the term heartburn is coined when you have heartburn you will feel as if the area around your heart is burning a slimy mucus-like substance protects our gastric walls this substance prevents any discomfort caused by the acidic gastric juices in our stomach the esophagus which is link to our gastric tract is more likely to be affected by gastric juices since it is not protected by any slimy substance this results in the burning feeling from heartburn according to dr cheng more and more singaporeans are suffering from heartburn this is mostly due to our diet and way of life it could be that singaporeans are eating too much oily fatty food like burgers and other similar kinds of greasy processed food eating too well can result in obesity this may also cause heartburn another reason is that patients are more concerned about their health these days and to go to the doctor whenever they feel uncomfortable because of this more cases of heartburn are discovered now than was compared with before we are also beginning to understand more about heartburn and this aids in diagnosing the condition foods and fluids must first pass through the esophagus or gullet to get to the gastric the lower end of the gullet is the main area where the regurgitation of the gastric juices occurs and people who are over-weight most of the abdominal is taken up by fat this pushes the stomach hard-up against the diaphragm so that the acid produce by the stomach is squeezed into the gullet when we eat excessively the resulting gastric pressure is also more likely to force the gastric juices into the esophagus as we age the stomach muscles would be more relaxed and less taut this is part of the natural aging process when this occurs when our stomach walls and lining are in relaxed state and if there is an increase in gastric pressure the pressure would force the food and gastric juices back up into the gullet or the esophagus then the question is what causes the increase in gastric pressure as we get older the abdomen grows bigger and this would result in a pressure that which pushes the food from the gastric upward to the esophagus as the population ages the number of heartburn patients increases how is heartburn treated usually the patients would work out a way themselves they may consult a family doctor and take the medication prescribed or they may buy some over-the-counter pain-killers or medicine for their gastric pain and this can be quite effective if the heartburn occurs often and causes a lot of pain or if we cannot eat because it causes too much pain and you lose weight you must consult the doctor a patient can find out how serious his or her condition is through a gastric endoscopy examination there are differing degrees of heartburn when there is a regurgitation of gastric juices into the esophagus slight inflammation will occur and the esophagus will be slightly swollen further stimulation of the esophagus especially at the lower end will result in ulcers and bleeding in severe cases of heartburn the self-structure around of the esophagus will start to ulcerate in the long run the esophagus will modify its inner lining so that it's similar to what we have in our stomach to protect itself from stimulation of the gastric juices this is called word esophagus however we don't know who will develop this condition some people may not develop word esophagus at all while others may stand a higher chance of getting cancer once they have  word esophagus there is about a seventy per cent chance of getting cancer when  word develops so what may appear an inconsequential ailment can actually be the beginning of severe illnesses not everyone recognises the symptoms of heartburn this condition can affect anyone without warning when you feel a sour taste in your mouth it indicates a regurgitation of gastric juices into the esophagus and the mouth this may mean that the condition of the reflux is quite serious it is even more severe if the gastric juices irritate your throat and cause asthma over the counter antacids can only relieve the symptoms of heartburn but they are unable to do anything about the slackening of the stomach muscles the only way to prevent the reflux of gastric juices is to change your eating habits we should cut down on the amount of food we eat since the problem always occurs after eating too much also do not lie down immediately after a meal this means no supper because we usually go to bed right after supper for those who cannot prevent heartburn caused by the slackening of stomach muscles one way of reducing the regurgitation of gastric juices is to prop themselves up with one or two pillows when they sleep when the upper half of the body is in a higher position the gastric juices are less lightly to flow upwards to the esophagus in addition we should avoid food like coffee tea alcohol and chocolate these foods tend to cause discomfort in patients other methods may include losing weight and not wearing clothes that are too tight-fitting clothes that are too tight at the abdomen will tend to push the food from the stomach up the esophagus one more thing people should be aware of is that the burning sensation caused by heartburn is similar to the symptoms of a heart-attack this presents a danger to patients who are unable to differentiate between heartburn and a heart-attack if a person feels uncomfortable when he is lying down while watching television he is most probably suffering from heartburn heart attacks usually occur when the patient is over-working his or herself in this case having sufficient rest will help ease the condition a heart-attack usually last three to five minutes and beyond that the condition is considered very dangerous heartburn may last for up to two or three hours what causes constipation how often do we have to clear waste from our body find out more after the break this week body talk answers questions regarding constipation  i'm bervyn lee most of our stories have come from you who have called in on our hotline well today we'll be meeting two more extraordinary people people who have quietly but faithfully touched the lives of others in their own special way many teachers find that

Singapore	i'm lisa and welcome to hey singapore tonight our story is more of curiosity rather than a mystery it's about inventions local inventions inventions that were patented as early as the nineteen sixties many of these inventions can be found in the files of cesa today singaporeans continue to put down their patents unfortunately due to the high costs of producing a prototype and mass production many of them remained just patent inventions today we go in search for the inventive singaporean tonight we dig into the little known world of local inventors and their inventions starting with this strange gadget what is it well it's used on something close to many of us in fact it was invented to deal with a very thorny issue we asked some people what they thought it was no one seems to have any idea what is it well the answer lies here at the ngee ann polytechnic you see the strange device is the work of these students who are about to reveal to us what it does watch closely a durian opener these final year students took about three months to think up of the idea and to make the device from scratch this unusual opener can soon be available for a mere twenty dollars our producer decided to try her hand on the durian opener after a few false starts she finally gets the hang of it and she does find it quite effective but this is just our amateur opinion would the experts agree we brought the durian opener here at the junction of albert and queen street to put it to the test seems no one is willing to give our strange looking tool a try until we come across mr chong with many years behind him selling durians he was not impressed not satisfied we sought a second opinion mr ong is another long time durian seller maybe he has a different opinion but he didn't have an easy time of it after much sweating and swearing he managed to open a durian so all's not lost the durian sellers we spoke to were somewhat encouraging they felt that the durian opener might be more useful for housewives than for the professionals but the idea is a good one and with some modifications perhaps this durian opener might be more effective our next invention is one that starts here where we came across an unusual phenomenon locked letterboxes what good are locked letterboxes how will the postman deliver the mail we traced these unusual letterboxes to a local inventor mr henry tan henry an ex-police constable of many years started working on an idea to keep junk mail out of our letter boxes an anti-junk mail letter box the path to the final product did not come easily it began with sketches and drawings followed by many prototypes the earliest which is this one how did henry come on the idea for an anti-junk mail letter box he told us he was once nearly arrested for littering when clearing his junk mail so for all of us in hdb units maybe an end to junk mail hdb and a bright sunny day perfect for housewives to hang out their freshly washed clothes to dry or is it living in high-rise flats we all encounter the problem of inconsiderate neighbours who let their wet clothes drip all the way down down to our carefully washed laundry and what happens our clothes become soiled of course is there a solution yes there is at the temasek polytechnic school of engineering we asked mr ? ? teo and his students what they have come up with a retractable clothes shelter this device is unique because it lets heat rays in through the transparent shelter to dry the clothes but protects the clothes from being soiled the invention can be commercialised though it cost the students three hundred dollars to build it mass production should bring the price down so now there's no need to get frustrated or irritated just go get retractable clothes shelter and all this dripping and soiling of our freshly washed clothes will be a thing of the past well although some of you may find that a rather strange invention it's actually quite a practical idea we are now here at the national archives retro-spin an exhibition of sounds in singapore from the fifties to the nineties and it is here at this exhibition that we were to make an amazing discovery this man here jay shotam he was the lead singer of one of the most popular groups in singapore called the october cherries back in the nineteen seventies jay and his brother claimed that they patented the first portable cassette player and filed it in london in nineteen seventy-six unfortunately due to lack of funds for mass production the patent lapsed when we come back we speak to jay shotam and we take a look at some other amazing inventions by singaporeans early this year the national archives was planning an exhibition of the sounds of singapore from the fifties the exhibition is on at the national museum to the twenty second of september and it was here that we were to uncover a most unusual story the story of a man named jay shotam lead singer the group october cherries who claimed he patented the portable cassette player now more commonly called the walkman it's here that we meet mr jay shotam he has an amazing story to tell us a story so fantastic that we won't have believed it if not for the evidence if you think that the concept behind the portable cassette player came from japan you may well be mistaken about twenty years ago four years before the launched product jay had invented a combined portable cassette player and headphone set in the old days if you wanted to listen to music on the move well you had to lurk one of these around this is the story of mr jay shotam the rest as they say is history we move on to the other end of singapore to find our next local inventor he's mr pang lian seng and he's been dabbling in inventions for the past twenty years we asked him what he had come up with and he pulled this out of his bag a self-cleaning duster the duster works with a cleaning material mounted on rollers a device inside removes chalk dust and other particles that collect in a reservoir mr pang had patented his invention not only in singapore but also as far away as uk why so many patents he tells us there isn't a body for world-wide patents and if inventors wanted to protect their ideas world-wide they must take up individual patents issued i each country back in the ngee ann polytechnic we had come across a durian opener well here another local culinary dish caught the attention of another group of students ? ? satay grilling machine electric heaters inside this contraption cooks satay as the satay swirls around inside but the most important question is does the satay still taste as good as those grilled over glowing charcoal and here are more wacky inventions from our ngee ann polytechnic students when we come back after the break we take a look at how one man invented a product which is currently used by penguins and others who are still trying to make their inventive dream a reality our search for local inventions has led us to the singapore bird park more specifically to the penguin display amazingly we learned that the health and well-being of these penguins are partly dependent on a singaporean invention the germitrol what is the germitrol to find out we tracked down mr derek seah owner of air search technology and the germitrol an air cleaner that kills germs this idea crew from a unique experience but how do you measure whether germs air-borne germs emphasises derek are effectively killed this device does it armed now with a better idea of the germitrol we decided to check it out in action here inside the penguin enclosure a rare opportunity to be on the other side of the glass amidst these curious and nosy penguins we saw the installed units working away to keep the air germ-free for these birds although the germitrol works invisibly dr wong from the bird park ensures us the units work the penguins are not the only ones benefiting from the invention these little puffins who also live in enclosed artificially maintained environments also benefit from the germitrol we're pretty sure that when derek first drew up his sketches and prototypes he wasn't thinking of penguins and puffins but the invention has a way of ending up in the most unexpected places we leave our feathered friends and head east to eunos he had wind of another local inventor frequently around the area he's mr gan chiu liang and his invention a strange looking crate what is it well we have to curb our curiosity as mr gan can only demonstrate his invention elsewhere our destination here at the marina square we stopped at this half hour photo lab and waited patiently for mr gan to arrive which he soon did putting together his invention was a puzzle as mr gan started with this camera then this a special laser printer in minutes mr gan finally had his invention up and running what does it do this is mr gan's visual card system a system that creates and prints cards lie these or this our crew tried mr gan's visual card system and we learned a unique feature of the system have your own photo on your name card so that's what the camera's for how does it all work well it uses ordinary photographic film we watched as the designs we had created appeared in this photo processing machine and as the pictures appear we saw our camera man a photo of himself on his very own personalised name card all in about half an hour name cards are not the only things you can create with mr gan's system how about giving away a unique birthday invitation like this one so singaporeans especially teenagers can look forward to creating anything these samples should give you an idea of what to expect though still in a prototype stage we were impressed that only with this but also the other inventions of singapore you have seen today though some inventions may not be that practical we did come across a few very enthusiastic inventors with rather brilliant ideas some of which have been taken up on by manufacturers and are currently out in the market others remain in their planning stages and for anyone that makes it in the market hundreds remain untouched but inventors being inventors never give up i'm lisa goodnight  the body's need for fluid is often neglected until one feels thirsty by the time you feel thirsty enough to reach for a drink you are already dehydrated next to oxygen water is a silent nutrient that is most needed for life besides keeping body temperatures stable water carries nutrients eliminates toxins and waste products maintains blood volume and provides the medium in which self-chemical reactions occur if too much fluid is lost blood pressure falls and less oxygen gets to the brain in addition blood thickens and can't reach small blood vessels each person needs at least two litres of water a day even if you are inactive your body loses up to two litres of water a day believe it or not that's six to eight glasses so it's important to drink regularly even if you are not thirsty just watch out for caffeine laden beverage and alcohol though they are fluid sources they actually dehydrate the body after consumption for pure drinking water is good liquid intake not only comes from beverages or the water we drink it's also in foods so they too can count towards your daily intake

choices of top restaurants in singapore we'll visit several more top restaurants in singapore next week meanwhile you can find them in wine and dine singapore top restaurants guide available at all bookstores next for wine novices here are some tips on accessing wines we will take a break but when we come back we sample the exotic flavours of africa  commercial break  hi i'm ai lin and welcome back to wine and dine the guide to the best in food and wine in singapore and in asia africa and singapore might be oceans apart but the exotic flavours of africa are now available on this sunny island we find out why a singaporean found the need to bring those flavours here  new york july nineteen ninety-two with the statue of liberty as backdrop the united states celebrated the five hundredth anniversary of christopher columbus' dicovery of the new world there is a theory based on archaeological findings that the ancient chinese has set foot on american soil hundred of years before the famous european explorer but even if proven true it is likely to be only an academic point with a grand multi-national sail pass complete with replicas of columbus' ships eloquent speeches were made about the pursuit of liberty and happiness america congratulated herself for being a land of opportunities indeed that was what drew a flood tide of people from the european continents since the last century and it was here at alice island that they first tasted the air of freedom and promise now a museum the landmark building on the island was the point of immigration for thousands who like columbus took the voyage across the atlantic ocean today alice island remains a symbol of hope the starting point in the journey towards the american dream but not for the chinese on the western edge of the continent where the pacific ocean rushes to meet the shore are two other islands one if alcatraz the fortress prison that used to be home for the most hardened criminals an island americans are so familiar with not too far away and not very well-known is angel island which was for the chinese immigrants a nightmarish perverse cross between alice and alcatraz angel island was the result of the exclusion act of eighteen eighty-two its sole purpose was to keep the chinese and only them out of the united states charged with causing unemployment and for being heathens america's doors were to remain shut to the chinese for over fifty years you don't find too many laundries in san franciso's chinatown today perhaps it's because few want the job which for so long has been associated with a second class status but in the long years of discrimination it was one of the few occupations opened to the chinese although the chinese are not longer confined to working just within chinatown there are many who would still argue that discrimination persists alfred lee director of the new york chinatown senior citizens' association is one of them he and others here are preparing for a demonstration against the federal government the point of contention is the allocation of jobs and contracts to chinese in a multi-million housing project in the chinatown area further demonstration had to be called understores for those who have been left out the fact that america land of opportunities dishes out opportunities selectively blatant discrimination may be gone but many charge that its subtle offsprings like the glass ceiling continue to frustrate chinese american professionals in their attempt to move up the managerial ladder doctor david lam would have been one of them had he not struck out on his own to set up a computer company in california silicon valley in days past it was the stereotyping of chinese that fed discrimination in the nineties such stereotyping has taken an ironic twist berkely university california the asian presence mainly chinese is unmistakable america is calling the chinese the model minority and often the disproportionately high number of chinese undergraduates in campuses like berkely seem to support that tag but the model minority label may be working against the chinese today as much as negatives stereotypes in the past had done so that misconception is not just confined to students and academic performance professor tian chan lim chancellor of berkely university entertaining and amusing is this young black american's approach to earning a living may seem his lot and that of others like him is what white america is more aware about few chinese even those desperately poor would do this and that perhaps is why their problems are never noticed the nineteen ninety census report for the us indicate that eighteen per cent of chinese live below the poverty line higher than the fifteen per cent national average and it is in the old tenements of chinatowns that they can be found the fongs came to san franciso from canton about a year ago the family of four has been living in this tiny room since they arrived it takes just two beds to cover almost all the floor space yet rent is us three hundred dollars a month the fongs are just scrapping by with the help of a relative who isn't very much better off himself the tendency to forget about people like the fongs and to focus only on successful chinese is something which is uncomfortable and worrying even for those who have scaled to the very top despite the promise of freedom and welcome america has yet to fully accept the chinese  that is exactly what many chinese in america fear the jealousy prejudice and animosity that had led time and again to physical attacks from the days of the very first chinese immigrants it may not be mentioned so much today but the memory of one such attack on a young man named vincent chin is deeply edged in the minds of many chinese americans it's still an uphill task for ethnic chinese in north america to gain acceptance but the onus is not just on white people charles pei hwa served as a member of the civil rights commission under former us president george bush he believes that to be accepted by main-stream society chinese americans must first take the initiative to redress a major short-coming the tendency to be parochial in their outlook but is that sentiment shared by most chinese those busy making a living? across north america shops in chinatowns do brisk business and the streets bustle with life the influx of new immigrants from asia has contributed to that but it has also caused some resentment among those who still see chinese as outsiders but the recently arrived who make up the bulk of the chinese population in north america don't seem to be too bothered with that many prefer literally to mine only their own business most of the newly arrived did not go through the harsh years of discrimination the toughest part in the road to acceptance had already been crossed and the days of being outcasts have faded in the distance but the journey is by no means over the challenge for the chinese in north america is to break away from being outsiders to integrate into their adopted countries and that may even be just as long a stretch to cover 
Singapore	at the crack of each dawn these thai novice monks will follow an ancient buddhist custom to seek that daily arms in the streets of bangkok and just as early each day another group of thais will be responding to an equally ancient but different practice chinese callisthenics these are ethnic chinese who are either from or trace their roots to the chow sun district in china's kwantong province they are teochews the dialect group that most ethnic chinese in thailand belong to and here at the spawling compound of the teochew association where the steps of taichi are still being practiced day after day it appears that even in thailand some ancient chinese ways have resisted the forces of assimilation and acculturation this temple was set up in memory of one of the early chinese pioneers wu chow sun besides being the traditional rallying point of the teochews in bangkok the temple provides both young and old the spiritual relief of the mahayanar school of buddhism a more eclectic chinese version of the federa  word school which the thai have adopted despite the variation the commonality found in buddhism was and still is a powerful factor in the grafting together of the thai and chinese communities only some eight per cent of the population have retained a pure chinese bloodline and it's estimated that over forty per cent are of mixed parentage but the passing of the older generation has distanced ancestral ways the practice of burial for instance has given way to the thai custom of cremation it's just one indication of how rapidly most chinese have assimilated for the fuel towards assimilation is inexorable in thailand and it's especially rapid amongst the middle-class chinese chen song te came to thailand when he was fourteen although married to a chinese nearly all his grand children are of mixed parentage chen tries often to speak to them in teochew but the boys can only reply in thai nearly all the goldsmith shops in bangkok are owned by ethnic chinese and for that matter so are most other businesses but it is accepted because there was a grafting of the two peoples and cultures into a collective thai identity the same however cannot be said of the chinese elsewhere in indonesia ethnic chinese makeup only one per cent of the population but are believed to control seventy per cent of the economy and that fact often sits uncomfortably with the widespread poverty it's just one reason why the chinese here have worked hard to down play and hide their chineseness but ethnicity has always been a sensitive issue in south-east asia a country like malaysia has been torn apart more than once by primordial pulls of race and religion and often the unspoken problem lay with the perceived unwillingness of the ethnic chinese to assimilate exalting mankind to share and respect the world this couplet reflects well the hopes of those who now call australia home for here one can find thousands who had come from indo-china and south-east asia many are ethnic chinese whose families had lived in asia for generations but who have found it necessary to leave their first adopted homes not only is remigration changing physical landscapes it is also altering the pattern of assimilation and acculturation with racial and cultural diversity as a reality western countries now have to come to terms with the asianisation of their societies this has been given added momentum in recent years by another huge outpouring of ethnic chinese who strangely enough are from a place where they are the majority this used to be the entry point into hong kong for thousands of chinese immigrants even today near this former railway station hakka women from china could be seen in their traditional costumes clinging stubbornly to the ways of the forebears vestiges of chinese culture denounced and discarded by the communist mainland still have a place under hong kong skies the traditional chinese reverance for bloodline family continuity and ancestral blessings still hold sway and the hong kong people like other overseas chinese have followed the collective impulse to pre-empt the vagaries of fate invoking the gods of their fathers and asking as their ancestors did for health children and especially success in life the form today may have modern permutations but the substance remains in this island of chinese capitalism the search for economic security has permeated all levels of society and so the impending return to china in nineteen ninety-seven has stacked the odds real or psychological against getting that security and thus the exodus from or some would even say the haemorrhaging of hong kong canada has been receiving a massive infusion of the new hong kong blood already some twenty-five per cent or more of vancouver's population is chinese and the figure is rising each day aberdeen centre in the vancouver's suburbs is a direct result of the invasion of people from hong kong with full wallets named after the aberdeen district in hong kong it is for all practical purposes a shopping mall transplanted from the british colony the immigration counter here is a simple reminder of the growing influx of ethnic chinese from hong kong and asia the property market is buzzing along spurred by land-hungry hong kong immigrants this however has created some awkwardness douglas chang is a second-generation canadian chinese and the first ethnic chinese to be elected as a member of parliament the chang family trace their canadian roots back to a chinese merchant who came to vancouver in the last century they see themselves as canadians and are concerned that the hong kong influx may undo the efforts of chinese who have been here for generations money and numbers two advantages the newly arrived have which immigrants in the past did not and this is also made them more resistant to acculturation in a white society despite being a minority they have put in modern but asian stamp on canadian society just as ethnic chinese in other countries have done but this has also raised the issue of how the chinese must now adapt to their homes in november last year a conference was held in san francisco to discuss the legal political and economic status of the overseas chinese today although acknowledging a common cultural heritage what was important was the emphasis given to the need for ethnic chinese to place their sense of belonging in the countries they now find themselves michael wu would not consider himself a china man but he was the one running for the office of mayor of los angeles last month although unsuccessful wu's efforts have continued the process of weaving an asian motiff into the fabric of american politics during the early stages of the campaign wu whose grandfather served under doctor soon yat sen shared his views on the challenges facing a chinese-american politician like himself broadway new york the cultural capital of america on the east coast as in the political arena the grafting of asian elements into american culture has begun although opportunities for asians are still paltry at least one broadway entertainer is optimistic that the tide will soon turn he is chris phillips better known to his asian fans as fei xiang for many ethnic chinese all over the world finding the place in the new homes has made it necessary for them at one time or another to define themselves and that definition can often be coloured by their ancient roots but with the impending raise of east asia especially china and the dawn of the pacific century will there be light or shadow cast on those who still seek to retain their ancient chinese roots  new buildings are changing the face of killiney road but many old tenants are still here retaining its character the killiney kopi tiam or just plain number sixty-seven has a new facet and spanking new interior gone are the rickety old waiters but its breakfast goodies are here to stay tea or coffee is now seventy cents a cup but it's nice and strong and it's only here that you can find killiney french toast bread dip in beaten egg toasted over charcoal and serve with a chunk of better and home-made kaiya isn't it time you got some kaiya from number sixty-seven in two months nearby households will have to look elsewhere for their supplies when this shop gives way to a more modern business but the barbers at number eighty-three intend to give many more haircuts yet no electric word here things are still done the good old way but if you have ten dollars to spend you'll be treated like royalty for some thirty years now mister rajoo has been yielding his trusty old scissors so rest assured you'll be in good hands and bone-pumping massage all part of the service tired of buying clothes off the rack mister lim peng chuan of wing luen tailors will suit you up in three days just next door one of the most famous frame-makers in singapore the merlin frame-makers started in nineteen seventy-four by mister chan chong yan with more than thirty years of experience choosing just the right frame is second nature to mister chan there are three branches and a flatted factory but this shop still serves faithful customers from the nearby nanyang academy of fine arts and customers come from all over the island there is nothing that mister chan cannot frame time for lunch how about cik fatimah's super dupper nasi padang it's a far cry from the original the shed they used to operate from but trust me satisfaction is guaranteed  midway along busy lavender street is the seng heng coffeeshop which still attracts customers despite its proximity to the bugis hawker centre one reason is its unique version of char kway teow tay cheng lian now mans the stall opened by his grandfather and the noodles just as tasty as when the old man fried them liberal splashes of stock make their version rather wet otherwise the ingredients are similar to the char kway teow found elsewhere you can always ask for additional helpings stable ingredients like cockles cuttle-fish shrimp and fishcake but what's really unique here is the topping of stewed minced pork which is generously applied whether you're eating in or taking out it may not be the traditional recipe but one thing's for sure customers keep coming back for more  these gleaming beauties lined up with more than two hundred other cars at he lau pa sat waiting the start of the nineteen ninety-three heritage car clues were given only minutes to the flag-off so teams worked feverishly to figure the first check point a smooth start for most of the two hundred and thirty-four cars but a temporary hiccup for this bashful vintage check point one was the national museum where participants ran about busily hunting for answers some teams relied on high-tech communications but the veterans had it all figured out veterans like doctor ivor thavertasen at check point number two the central manpower base off dempsey road an auto test awaited the eager beamer driver who were more than keen to show off their skill behind the wheel at macritchie reservoir it was a scramble up to the lim bo seng memorial and the clues were well hidden with characters like the fat boys how could the event be anything but a load of fun although the soon yat sun villa in ah hood road doesn't normally entertain such noisy visitors it's back to the serious search for clues which brought participants all the way to mandai and next the lee rubber factory figuring that out is one thing kicking a cha-tek the required number of times is quite another the clues pointed to an esso station next all the way the other side of the island in tampines and participants squeezed into the office hunger refreshments and more clues hidden inside  for some it was time ice-cream but for others there was still more quiz questions to complete whether on their or with the help of unseen consultants back at the lau pa sat the end of a hectic but satisfying morning and no matter what the result time for a well-deserved rest 
Singapore	falls creak vancouver some a hundred years ago the poor chinese immigrants who lived in make-shift shelters here were often the objects of scorn and physical abuse one particularly notorious attack involved two chinamen tied together by their pig-tails they were thrown into the water for no reason other than they were chinese in the right twist of history the whole stretch of the far bank today belongs to and it's being developed by a chinese hong kong billionaire lee kah shing and overseeing the project is his chinese canadian associate stanley kwok this is just one example of the growing economic clout of ethnic chinese a phenomenon that stems from and resonates with an east-asia in ascendance and that resonance especially with china is something that those who called themselves the dragon descendants have always found hard to ignore the chinese cultural centre in vancouver acts very much like the centennial in the preservation of the ancient chinese heritage with that in mind one area in particular has been accorded high priority these children have been sent here by parents who wish to see them retain the use of their mother tongue the same intent also motivates others in the united states many parents are uncomfortable with the fact that their children are fast losing their competence in the chinese language in the chinese mind knowing the language is seen as crucial to the tapping of the chinese cultural wellspring and integral to the definition of being chinese in days past that definition went even further to include a political identification with china overseas chinese money and support were instrumental in helping doctor sun yat sen overthrow the manchu dynasty and for that contribution doctor soon was to call them the mother of the revolution evidence of such close links in the past can still be seen today many overseas chinese continued to support their ancestral homeland long after doctor soon's death the japanese invasion of china in brutal treatment of civilians between nineteen thirty-seven to nineteen forty-five saw not only a tremendous outpouring of money for china's war effort but also arouse intense animosity towards japan china's enemy became the overseas chinese as well but world war two also brought about a change in the relationship between ethnic chinese in america and china having fought for the united states they had showed clearly whether allegiance and sense of belonging laid they had become americans but same experience were shared by those who fought on canada's side douglas chang who was decorated for bravery in action remembers but the unfolding drama in china continued to impact the ethnic chinese elsewhere especially those in south-east asia at first the fact that china had finally stood up after years of humilation and turmoil was celebrated not only by those of the mainland but also by the overseas chinese the celebration however was short-lived and any fond hope of returning of returning to china was soon dashed by a confluent of factors that question was to put thousands in a terrible fix in indonesia the involvement of some ethnic chinese in the abortive communist coup of nineteen sixty-five implicated entire communities in an atmosphere of turmoil and suspicion many innocent lives were lost that experience was a sombre reminder that any affiliation to china even cultural was easily misconstrued and harshly rewarded with mao's cultural revolution links between ethnic chinese in china received a further blow south-east asia weary about any spill-over to their shores slammed their doors shut to china the change only came in nineteen seventy-nine when teng xiao ping flung china's doors open with a billion people hungry for trade and product links with china suddenly became an advantage one of those who responded to that pull is the chairman of singapore's united overseas bank wee chor yeow convinced that china offered huge opportunities after a trip there in nineteen seventy-nine wee proceeded with his investments capitalising on the linkages that ethnic chinese enjoy the empathy that ethnic chinese abroad have for china and her ways have made it easier for them to penetrate the huge market this however has led some to question the motives of those who are doing business with the mainland a misconception ethnic chinese will like to correct by investing in china ethnic chinese abroad have again renewed ties with their ancestral homeland but although forged by business rather than politics the re-establishing of such ties will still have to be managed carefully the renewal of ties with china is not initiated solely by the ethnic chinese abroad china is also actively seeking to tap their resources and expertise it is for this reason that the leaders of singapore whose efforts have contributed to the city state's economic prosperity are much sought after visitors but just how significant is the role played by ethnic chinese abroad in transforming china the senior minister of singapore lee kuan yew so in many ways a china that is doing well will also free the ethnic chinese abroad from the psychological stigma of being off-shoots of a failed civilization not only that a china plugged into the modern world would also be instrumental in shifting the economic centre of gravity to east asia but will china disappoint by failing again the promise of an east asian renaissance however goes beyond its anticipated economic preeminence in the next century many believe that there is also much to rediscover in the chinese heritage so that tomorrow's progress will not be devoid of yesterday's wisdom and here ethnic chinese as inheritors of an ancient culture have much to hold on to and share but are ancient chinese values relevant to modern living in the west the increasing number of old folks living alone or in homes is a reality that contradicts the fundamental chinese ideal of filial piety and respect for elders this old man is seeing his family for the first time in over ten years he had chosen to stay behind in san francisco when they emigrated to australia situations like these are not confined to western societies the pressures that modernisation brings are felt on a global level and the ethnic chinese are not spared does this mean that the chinese tradition is also fast becoming irrelevant in today's ground in many ways the story of the overseas chinese ends when the ethnic chinese abroad embrace the nationalities of their countries these children for example may not consider themselves as overseas chinese and rightly so because they are americans but they and others like them will inherit a tradition that had guided their parents and the chinese people for thousand of years so will they discard that heritage in a rapidly changing world or will they try to harmonise the ancient wisdom found in it with the demands of modernisation their choice will determine what is to be written in the epilogue of the story of the overseas chinese  handphones you just can't leave home without it that's what hundred and twenty thousand singaporeans say and for japanese models which are forty per cent of this market prices look set to increase whether prices for handphones will go up will depend much on where the yen is heading in the past six months the yen rose by more than twelve per cent against the sing dollar so far most brands including sony sharp pioneer have taken a hard bash from the yen's rise in the past month prices of these japanese goods have risen by three to ten per cent the full twelve per cent rise in the yen may not be reflected on their price tags yet but for the four wheelers the price hike is beyond the full rise of the yen the omv or open market value of the car includes the insurance freight charges customs uplift which is a form of tax on the car and their invoice cost which is affected by the currency movements take a family car the honda civic one point six esi manual transmission six months back the omv was seventeen thousand dollars today with the yen factor it's at twenty thousand dollars an increase of three thousand with custom duties and the additional registration fee or arf of hundred and ninety-five per cent the three thousand increase is further compounded to nearly nine thousand dollars and these price increases have been largely borne by car buyers across the board other japanese cars like mitsubishi nissan toyota have all increased their prices with the rise of the yen and some businessmen say that their profit margins have been squeezed as they have to bear part of the yen's rise although recent political upheaval in japan has sent the yen sliding a little some say this may just be a temporary breather with the pressure to keep the yen strong some people hope for a replay of what took place in the eighties when the rising yen then led to a surge of japanese investments here the yen factor today does not call for a celebration here or in japan keeping watch on the yen and waiting for the sun to rise again is now just part of the japanese way of life  it was a hot day but these people were undaunted some have queued for more than twelve hours for the chance to buy a choice unit at parc oasis a new condo development in jurong east the apartments were snapped up as if they were free buyers were willing to pay more than four hundred thousands dollars for each unit that was a month ago today buyers are willing to pay up to fifty thousand dollars more in the resale market not surprising new condos in the outlying nort-west north and north-east of the island went like hot cakes last year projects like hue park bishan park and tanah merah were sold within days the tanah merah for example more than thirty per cent of the buyers were upgraders from the nearby hdb towns to cater to this niche market most of the properties are priced in the mid level range with different locations commanding different prices but on average condos in the north-west like upper bukit timah cost ten per cent more than the other two regions they're popular with expatriates working in the nearby jurong industrial estate rents in this region are also one to two per cent higher but compared to the prime districts east and west coast rents in outlying areas are as attractive but not so for anthony fong he made good capital gains rather quickly this dairy farm apartment was bought last year for six hundred thousand today anthony can sell it for almost a million like dairy farm prices of condos in the north-west tend to rise faster and higher than those in the other regions half a per cent higher than the north and two per cent more than the north-east even with the record two thousand condo units to be launched in the next two years prices in upper bukit timah are unlikely to fall another up and coming area in the north-west is woodlands the future business and leisure hub in the north to be built within the next ten years the woodlands regional centre will have entertainment joints cinemas and offices by nineteen ninety-six the mrt will be completed and the american school will have relocated here these developments will benefit the eight hundred units of new condos and houses along woodlands avenue one but that's in two years' time meanwhile the more established areas like yishun and yio chu kang are drawing the crowds the next most popular region after the north-west condos like bullion park cost about four hundred dollars per square foot but the closer they are to the city in bishan and ang mo kio the higher the price and the greater the demand another popular area is the north-east along upper changi road loyang and pasir ris these may not be near the city but they are cheaper than the north and north-west  the main attraction however is its proximity to the east coast and the surrounding recreation clubs in addition homebuyers are also wooed by plans to transform nearby tampines into another business regional centre developers are optimistic about the potential of this area as can be seen from the number of condos sprouting up especially along upper changi road so far five hundred and twenty units have already been matketed and another one thousand four hundred will be launched in the next two years a few streets away in simei a new condo will hit the market in september hailed as the largest development in singapore more than one thousand two hundred units will be up for sale this will bring the total number of condos in the north-east to a staggering two thousand nine hundred another two thousand six hundred is expected in the north-west and more than eight hundred in the north the total supply coming on stream is an overwhelming six thousand four hundred units in the next two years so it seems there's no need for scenes like these anymore with ample supply coming up buyers should'nt panic but take their time to pick the right homes 
Singapore	sight many of us take it for granted until something happens what balachanda didn't know was that he had developed carytic conus a condition where his cornea had become uneven balachanda is just one of fifty people every year who are afflicted with cornea disease the cornea is a transparent skin covering the eye when it's diseased vision is blocked the only hope is a transplant where the old cornea is removed and replaced by a new cornea it is a simple operation but difficult to perform simply because of a lack of donor corneas because of the shortage balachanda had to get by the first year on special contact lenses instead each pair cost him seven hundred dollars finally last june nearly two and a half years after his problem began balachanda received the call to say that a donor cornea was available he had the operation the very next day and today relies on that eye which now has almost perfect vision but his problem isn't totally over because only one eye is clear he has problem balancing his vision in both eyes he now hopes that the same operation can be carried out again this time to correct the other eye and bala isn't the only one every year over a hundred and fifty people are on a waiting list for the operation the actual number is even higher if you take into account those waiting at private hospitals doctors say we need to triple our present number of donors in order to meet our needs at the moment most of the corneas available are imported each week the singapore national eye centre places an order for two donor corneas from sri lanka since nineteen sixty-four singapore has received between three and four hundred corneas from the country the world's largest cornea donor it is six am and a cornea ordered last week has just arrived from sri lanka it comes packed in a special fluid which can preserve it for up to five days by the time it arrives it is at least two days old and things have to move fast to avoid any more delay by nine am the eye is collected and rushed to the hospital there it's carefully store in the freezer at below four degrees four hours later tests are done on the eye by the next morning the operation is underway the lucky recipient is a seventy year old man who's already blind in one eye the operation is to try save the other during the operation the donor cornea is measured and cut to size within the hour it is sown on this operation is the only hope for the patient if successful it could mean restoring vision to the eye he has waited over six months for this operation getting a healthy cornea is difficult in fact sometimes corneas are rejected on arrival in some cases the quality was in doubt but used anyway because the patient could not afford to wait any longer last year the singapore general hospital stop using corneas from sri lanka for a period of time for fear of aids and hepatitis infection doctors told us that the best solution would be to use local corneas this way there'll be greater control over their quality  good local fare is usually found only at hawker centres probably the most popular among locals and tourists alike is the newton food centre open twenty-four hours a day newton is famous for its good food and ambience but until recently the eating place was also notorious for some of singapore's most aggressive store holders their strong arm tactics ended when two previous stall tenants had their operating licences revoked for over-charging and harassing customers bidding for the vacant stores quickly took place and the results raised eye-brows throughout singapore while the monthly rental at newton once averaged two hundred dollars stall number fifty-six's new tenant bid a whopping fifteen thousand five hundred dollars the successful bid for stall number sixty amounted to ten thousand one hundred and sixty-eight dollars many existing newton stall holders don't believe the new tenants can survive insiders say some stores can earn up to three thousand dollars a day as newton remain possibly the best location for hawkers and the high-roller bidders with their big-time bets are gambling on that knowledge one of them is the owner of a well-known roast duck chain of eight outlets located throughout singapore he is johnson lock and his is a rag-to-riches story lock who started at fourteen as a kitchen helper earning two dollars a day was promoted to an assistant cook before compulsory stint in the army after that he gave cooking lessons at a community centre he then ventured into the chicken-rice business but somehow figured out that there was more money in roasted ducks while its competitors then sold each duck for twenty to thirty dollars he shrewdly slashed the price to thirteen dollars a duck thirteen dollars a duck was and still is possible because lock doesn't need to go through a middleman he owns a factory that supplies roasted ducks directly to his outlets while competitors charge seasonal prices lock's price is fixed at thirteen dollars a duck his no nonsense pricing has allowed business volume to grow dramatically today he sells about thirty thousand ducks a month lock is confident that his newton stall rent of ten thousand one hundred and sixty-eight dollars will be covered at thirteen dollars a duck he would need to sell only forty ducks a day to break even but lock is confident that the crowd at newton will be able to bring him profits by one estimate if lock does manage to sell two hundred ducks a day just at newton he could gross around two thousand six hundred dollars a day or about eighty thousand dollars a month his rental would then be more than well covered so rental doesn't seem to be the major issue in johnson lock's business rather his main problem which all hawkers are facing is the shortage of labour although he pays his workers a minimum of one thousand two hundred dollars a month plus yearly bonuses for a six day week finding helpers has proven difficult opening the newton stall may mean closing down one of his other outlets to reallocate his work force the shortage of labour in singapore limits lock's expansion plans here so he's looking at malaysia for the future but in the meanwhile lock is looking forward to the opening of his new store at newton on the second of march whether he makes money there remains to be seen but the ambition and determination driving him there's a good chance he will succeed  our growth in 1986 is a small 19 per cent half the economy manufacturing transport and communications - has done well the other half commerce financial and business services and construction remains depressed the economy is recovering because we took decisive measures to tackle our economic problems directly we reduced business costs including cutting taxes and employers' cpf contributions and restrained wage increases our workers and trade unions have supported these actions by not flinching from painful policies singaporeans have spared themselves higher inflation and a longer recession the soft option would have been for no reduction in employers' cpf contributions no wage restraint minor cost-cutting instead we would have had to accept a drop in the exchange rate of the singapore dollar as the economy continued to weaken and the foreign exchange markets pushed the singapore dollar down the drop would have needed to be sizable to achieve the equivalent of a 15 per cent reduction in employers' cpf contributions this would have led to a high inflation rate of more than 10 per cent because singapore imports its food oil nearly all manufactured and semi-manufactured products then workers' pay and cpf would have appeared the same or even more but would have been worth less in purchasing power instead our inflation rate was less than zero: - 14 per cent that is each singapore dollar bought slightly more in 1986 than in 1985 by dealing with the problem head on we have simplified and shortened the process of adjusting our economy and have avoided inflation external factors like the appreciation of the yen have helped but we would have not been able to take advantage of these favourable developments if we had not set our house in order if singapore had not become more competitive japanese companies looking for an external location because of a higher yen would have skipped singapore the forecast for the region is continued low commodity prices and therefore continued slow growth those sectors of the singapore economy that are linked to the region will not perform well our growth rate in 1987 is expected to be only 3-4 per cent this is not only less than the 6-8 per cent projected for the other newly industrialising countries nics it is also below our own estimated long-term growth rate of 4-6 per cent it shows that our recovery is not complete ministry of trade & industry mti calculations show that although we have improved in competitiveness against the other nics we have not fully recovered the competitiveness we enjoyed against them before our high wage increases in 1980-83 we need at least one more year of high productivity growth and wage restraint to close the gap if their wages go up this year whilst we stay put the gap will narrow at the same time we must press on with reforming our wage payment system in a next recession and there will inevitably be a next one we are unlikely to have large employers' cpf contributions to cut back at present we have in-built rigidities in our wage structure the nwc has endorsed its subcommittee report on wage reform twenty-three large local companies and mncs as well as the banking and insurance groups are already discussing these ideas with their unions companies who have not started should do so the objectives are to build flexibility into our wage system and to link workers' rewards to a productivity growth b performance of the firm and c performance of the individual flexibility will increase the survival capacity of companies it is a safety margin for workers so that they can keep their jobs when companies fare poorly if they do this in a next recession management can reduce costs rather than output by cutting the flexible component of wages so we can recover from the recession more quickly with fewer workers retrenched my younger colleagues have diagnosed our economic problems they decided on cost-cutting and wage restraint to attract new investments and to create a favourable climate for a total business centre union leaders have persuaded and convinced the workers to back this strategy and our economy is on the mend but the more difficult part will come next year although mti forecasts 3-4 per cent growth commerce financial and business services and construction are not expected to rebound and growth will have to come from manufacturing and transport & communications to reach a figure of four per cent for the economy as a whole these two sectors manufacturing and transport and communications will have to grow by eight per cent a high target achievable only if we keep costs down and productivity up therefore to improve the overall performance of the economy manufacturing and transport and communications workers will have to moderate their wage expectations workers will feel the pick up by early 1987 when the nwc will be considering the 1987 recommendations factories will work more overtime and hire more workers workers will read of better profits in company reports the result of last year's cost-cutting they will be tempted to heed the good news and to press for a wage increase with output training if employers in the manufacturing sector relent and become overgenerous they will become the pace setter  then wages in other sectors will be forced to follow suit regardless of their ability to pay if this happen our entire strategy for economic recovery will be jeopardized the test for our younger generation of singaporean leaders and workers is whether they can put long-term interests ahead of short-term gains and by demonstrating wage-restraint discipline win the confidence of investors i wish you all a happy new year 
Singapore	 introduction  1 at the teachers' day rally last september prime minister goh chok tong outlined the challenges to our education system a key imperative was national education many singaporeans especially pupils and younger singaporeans knew little of our recent history they did not know how we became an independent nation how we triumphed against long odds or how today's peaceful and prosperous singapore came about 2 this ignorance will hinder our effort to develop a shared sense of nationhood we will not acquire the right instincts to bond together as one nation or maintain the will to survive and prosper in an uncertain world for singapore to thrive beyond the founder generation we must systematically transmit these instincts and attitudes to succeeding cohorts through national education we must make these instincts and attitudes part of the cultural dna which makes us singaporeans 3 the prime minister set up a committee chaired by mr lim siong guan to study how to introduce national education into our education system the committee has worked out a plan to do so to take the next step forward we need the full commitment of every teacher and principal national education is not just a book subject it must appeal to both heart and mind unless you are personally convinced of its importance committed to the cause and have the knowledge and passion to teach national education competently and whole-heartedly the plan will fail  lessons from other countries  4 singaporeans are not unique in needing national education other countries take national education as a matter of course japan is a tightly-knit cohesive and group-oriented society with a long history and a strong sense of unique identity yet japanese schools start early to teach pupils japanese culture values history and geography and even the politics and economics of japan as pupils get older they also learn about the cultures and histories of other countries in so doing they understand even better what makes them uniquely japanese 5 japanese schools go to great lengths to instill group instincts and a sense that every student is an equal member of the group they have strict regulations on school uniforms school bags and shoes students are grouped into teams called 'hans' members of each han play together and eat together they take turns to perform specific responsibilities whether it is the daily cleaning of school premises or serving lunch academically stronger students are expected to help their weaker friends those who do not are ostracised students organise the school sports day themselves competition is based mainly on team events there are few or no individual events all students participate including those with disabilities 6 japanese schools do all this not because they believe that all students are the same in every respect or have identical abilities but they want every student to be equally valued as a member of the group recognised for his strengths and for what he can contribute to the group and so it goes for japanese society 7 in us schools every child is taught the american heritage george washington the declaration of independence the us constitution the civil war and the civil rights movement students take part in community service learning to be a responsible citizen begins young it is a deliberate inculcating of american political and social values and ideals to ensure the next generation grows up with these ideas deeply ingrained it is a process of indoctrination like any other no less so because the children are brought up to cherish american values of individual liberty and it is so successful that many americans are completely convinced that american values are universal values of mankind 8 if countries like japan and the us with long histories and deep roots have found it essential to pass on national instincts systematically from generation to generation all the more singapore a young country barely one generation old must make a concerted effort to imbue the right values and instincts in the psyche of our young  objectives of national education  9 national education aims to develop national cohesion the instinct for survival and confidence in our future we cannot offer our next generation any fixed formula for success or even any set goals in life they will face new circumstances and problems they will need to think through and work out their own solutions but we must equip them with the basic attitudes values and instincts which make them singaporeans this is the common culture that will give them a shared perception of life and draw them closer together as one people when confronted with serious problems this will give them a well-founded faith in the country's future this is the dna to be passed from one generation to the next 10 there are four elements to achieving this objective 11 first we must foster in our young a sense of identity pride and self-respect as singaporeans this will strengthen their emotional attachment to the nation and their sense of rootedness we are proud of our country we are proud of what we have achieved together - our economic progress our clean and green environment our open and clean system of government our way of life we are proud that each of us in his or her own way contributes to singapore's success 12 but success must not lead to hubris we must never be over-bearing or arrogant or look down on people from other countries we do not have all the answers for ourselves much less for other countries but neither have we any reason to be ashamed to say i am a singaporean in fact quite the contrary 13 second our young must know the singapore story how singapore succeeded against the odds to become a nation national education is not an abstract sermon on general principles of nationhood it is to do with a special story our story it is the story of singapore how we came to be one nation we did not start off with this goal or even as one people nobody imagined this would be the outcome 14 as a british colony from 1942 to 1945 for 3 and frac12 years of the japanese occupation we suffered a traumatic experience of cruelty brutality hunger and deprivation we lived through the post-war years of communist-inspired unrest and upheaval we then joined with the federation of malaya to form malaysia despite pressure and intimidation we stood firm in malaysia against the communalists the issue was a fundamental one equal basic rights and opportunities for all malaysian citizens under the malaysian constitution and no special rights for anyone in the state of singapore on the basis of race language and religion as was agreed in the state constitution of singapore as a result we suddenly found ourselves out on our own as an independent country with few means to make a living or defend ourselves yet we developed our economy built up the saf educated and housed our people got them to work together and gradually became one nation year by year we transformed singapore into what it is today 15 knowing this history is part of being a singaporean it is the back-drop which makes sense of our present it shows what external dangers to watch out for and where our domestic fault lines lie it explains what we stand for and believe in and why we think and act the way we do it gives us confidence that even when the odds look daunting with determination and effort we will prevail 16 thirdly our young must understand singapore's unique challenges constraints and vulnerabilities which make us different from other countries singapore is not as other countries we will always be small we will always worry about our water supply we will always have to work harder and do better than other countries that is the hand which geography and history have dealt us overall it is not a bad hand nor have we played it badly we have compensated for these constraints by being more resolute and resourceful more efficient and productive and quicker and nimbler than other countries which are better endowed and have larger margins for error and we have been so successful that sometimes we forget that the underlying realities endure and have not gone away singaporeans need to understand these realities to work together and support the policies that are necessary to deal with them 17 knowing our constraints should make us more determined to overcome them it is no cause for despair we overcame more severe difficulties in our first years of nationhood with far fewer resources and in more dire circumstances we are much better placed to tackle them now 18 finally we must instill in our young the core values of our way of life and the will to prevail that ensure our continued success and well being our core values include the system of meritocracy which guarantees fair and full opportunities for all multi-racial and multi-religious harmony and honest and competent government working for the long-term interests of all singaporeans we often take these for granted because things have been this way in singapore for a long time but not new citizens who often come with fresh direct experience of very different societies pupils must learn to treasure and uphold these social and political values if we ever lose them singapore will quickly become a very different place  strategies  19 we need to develop national instincts among pupils at all levels national education will begin in schools and continue in post-secondary and tertiary institutions after ten to fifteen years of education all students should know the facts about singapore and feel attached to singapore their best home those likely to go on to play leadership roles later should at least have had some preliminary preparation for their responsibilities we will achieve this through both the formal and informal curricula  formal curriculum  20 we will introduce national education content across the formal curriculum we can do more of this in some subjects than others the main subjects will be social studies and civics and moral education cme at the primary level history geography and cme at secondary level and the general paper and cme at the junior colleges in addition literature and the languages can also be used  subjects at primary level  21 in primary schools we will start teaching social studies earlier beginning from primary 1 instead of primary 4 social studies will complement civics and moral education cme will emphasise teaching of values and correct individual behaviour while social studies will give pupils an understanding of singapore society 22 pupils must start early to learn about the society around them to feel a sense of belonging to family school and community to befriend and accept pupils of all races and to develop a simple unabashed pride in singapore they recite the pledge sing majullah singapura and recognise our flag later they will learn the meaning of the crescent and five stars but long before that when they see the helicopter flying past with the state flag on national day they should sense that it is a very special occasion  subjects at secondary level  23 at secondary level students currently learn the history of our independence period only in secondary 1 the 'o' level history syllabus stops in 1963 which perversely omits the vital period leading to our independence we will extend the 'o' level history syllabus for singapore to 1971 the period of merger separation and the early years of independence will also be taught in secondary 2 instead of secondary 1 so that the students will be a little more mature and appreciate better what was at stake 24 at the upper secondary level we will develop a new social studies subject it will cover issues central to singapore's survival and success our principles of governance the strategies that have brought singapore here the role of key institutions like the saf hdb cpf edb and ntuc and our future challenges  it will use examples from other countries to explain what works and what fails and derive lessons for singapore subjects at the jc level 25 in the junior colleges students should start to learn what leadership involves and to develop a commitment to serve society through the general paper and civics lessons they must acquire the sense that they can shape their own future and more important that it is their responsibility to shape singapore's future they must be able to think independently and rationally and reach informed conclusions about national issues 26 moe will take 3-4 years to implement the new syllabi as the school curriculum is already heavy we will make the changes without increasing the curriculum load we want the new syllabi to give teachers more time not less to engage in creative ways to bring issues to life for their students 
Singapore	we awarded many young people whose achievements have benefited our society they may be pioneers in their own field or prefer to serve the community by helping those who are less unfortunate than they are whichever the case all are exemplary and an inspiration to others the awards have been given out every year to individuals or teens who excel in various fields be it within or outside their chosen professions celebrating the silver jubilee the awards foster a sense of national pride in our youths some have achieved international honour for singapore but these are ordinary young people who strive to attain their dreams no matter how impossible they seem a selfless quality and an unwavering passion for their work have served to strengthen the social fabric of our nation and their innovative ideas have not only put singapore on the world map but have far-reaching benefits at home the awardees are self-motivated and dedicated to their dreams sustained by a strong vision some are trail blazers who demonstrate great courage in the face of diversity although they are honoured by what they have achieved before the age of 35 their service is ongoing for these young people the singapore youth award is not an end but only the beginning a testament to the endless possibility they can achieve apart from his wealth of medical expertise dr tan chee choo is an adventurer and a humanitarian not only does he help the under-privileged he also encourages young people to broaden their horizon and to develop a sense of community spirit whether he is leading a medical expedition to a remote part of the world or organising a local fund raising event dr tan's passion to help his fellow man and his sense of adventure is infectious he witnessed the brutality of war when he was sent on the singapore armed forces gulf war medical mission in 1991 he saw the devastation of the natural catastrophe when he led a medical relief mission to the philippines after a 1990 earthquake and he helped to relieve the human suffering of poverty and disease in fact since the age of 26 dr tan chee choo has been involved in ten missions to underdeveloped or remote areas of the world whether military or scientific or part of singapore each expedition expands dr tan's repertoire of community work now he actively heads projects which encourage young people to follow in his footsteps  no kidding it's the truth i don't lie it's the truth it's going to be a great show on the show tonight ladies and gentlemen we got from chang and eng the producer and director ekachai uekrongtham ya also from chang and eng we have the composer and lyricist ken low is with us ken low very low ken low also ladies and gentlemen i have respected this man for many many years very funny comedian and writer and a blues singer as well siva choy is with us tonight ladies and gentlemen yah so this week you guys did you all hear the latest thing is now ah lta has come out with a website for traffic what happens is that they have installed satellite systems into each taxi so that when you log on onto internet on the website it tells you on the map which road is a lot of traffic jam which road is clear and all that this is amazing i think this is fantastic finally there is a technology like that this is amazing what happens is this if you log on and you look on the map if you see a green road green road means clear no traffic thatæs good go ahead and drive there if you want to if you are going out now red the opposite would mean traffic jam pink it means your computer spoil but the latest thing also is digital radio have you guys heard this this is new to me i just found out only a few days ago digital radio radio is going digital which means you will hear extra clear crisp sounds music and everything will be so clear but on top of that technology it would allow you to hear the deejays who have fake american accents to hear the singapore english for example if this deejay comes on the air with this fake american accent going æhello everybody we got mariah carey have we got a little song form her it's the latest one called i want to wear his clothes for you baby it's a really nice cool song check it out now that is a fake american accent what would happen is that digital radio would translate this and come out with singapore english immediately and you will hear okay now got this song ah quite nice lah and the title so long so what for we say ha uh the girl the singer is malay curry eh is a very good song uh you see lah you listen okay lah i press play button ha okay that would be the english translation isn't that a great translation uh we wanted to get a eràa apecial guest here on the show we couldn't because they are still going undergoing therapy as i understand uh we are talking about of course uh the tamarinds the monkeys that were kidnapped you heard about that the monkeys that were kidnapped from the zoo and you knew it was a big thing and all that i think we should give an applause for the authorities for catching them back again safe and sound i think that was good on the news but i want to want to ask a question when the kidnappers were taking the monkeys away what were they thinking were they thinking of selling the monkeys to somebody here in singapore go to aunty aunty no no this one is that the monkey that one stolen one it's actually red rabbit very good for chinese new year angpow i think those kidnappers are basically idiots that's what they are  may day 1989 is a time for rejoicing four years ago on may day 1985 singaporeans were down in the dumps suffering their first recession since 1964 what have we learnt from this experience first that we must be careful not to push high wage increases in 1979 and should have stopped them by 1982 unfortunately we repeated them in 1983 and 1984 and these wage increases ran ahead of productivity growth this caused our unit labour cost to be higher than that of south korea taiwan and hong kong second the strengthening singapore dollar increased our uncompetitiveness in exports we must avoid repeating this error by closely monitoring wage levels productivity increases exchange rates and the profitability of enterprises in singapore compared to south korea taiwan and hong kong we corrected our errors by cutting costs and so enabled managements to recapture exports that made for 1988's growth rate of 11 per cent could we have guaranteed this recovery no way the union had to depend on the government's judgments and good faith the ntuc was formed in 1961 after the non-communist unions split away from the association of trade union satu which was controlled by pro-communist union a few weeks before that 13 pro-communist assemblymen had broken away from the pap to form the barisan sosialis from the start there was trust and confidence between pap and ntuc it has been maintained ever since ntuc leaders knew that pap government policies were tailored to help generate high profits for companies in order that we can wipe out unemployment and later pay better wages as the economy advanced good wages plus high government revenues paid for hdb homes good hospitals schools community centres and all the infrastructure and facilities of modern city today 84 per cent of our workers own their own homes all have cpf accounts averaging $37000 after ten years and $22000 after five years once we knew by mid 1988 that we headed for exceptional growth the government restored all pay cuts in the public sector when we knew by december 1988 that we had

Singapore	the dream team and they're all back sundram moorthy often described as the most skilful player on the field malek awak the most hardworking player and asset to any team often called the dynamo abbas saad play maker alistar edwards also back with a nice personal touch in more ways than one and of course singapore's golden boy fandi ahmad everyone's model player i spoke with patrick ang the general manager and the man who did the wheeling and dealing to make this team possible and their presence is certainly felt in the team well sentiments are quite mixed for the older they're glad to be back for reasons personal or otherwise for the younger ones is un understandable if they feel they are a little overlooked but whatever it is the team spirit and morale is quite high well definitely better than last year which everyone remembered as the dooms year for local soccer not the least of which the singapore team was relegated to division two i spoke to the present coach p n sivaji but he told me that he rather not make any comments as he wanted to fully concentrate on training the boys at this point in time however the problems that plagued local soccer last year were not unfamiliar coaches went in and out there was mismanagement of the team and lack of commitment from the players themselves as a result games were lost many fans turned away from soccer and the kallang roar died but today many have come back because of the new team and the exciting prospects of winning the malaysia cup but former skipper of the national team terry pamanathan feels that having good players might not always mean winning the game so is this then a sign of better things to come for singapore soccer  hi i'm lisa today hey singapore goes to seletar the name seletar was said to have come from the term orang seletar which refers to the natives which raffles encountered when he first landed in singapore in 1925 the hms pergasus completed a most successful and historic voyage of discovery for the royal british airforce or raf the pioneers of the pergasus had found the size of the future airbase thus starting a long association of the raf with singapore and these men were part of the first squadron flying halfway around the world clearing the site posed difficulties including having to do the overhauling in the open but even before being officially declared open the airbase was already part of the greatest flight in history in 1928 during the far east flight upon its completion the airbase welcomed celebrities and aviation access to their grounds sir charles word smith considered one of the great pilots of all time landed in seletar in 1930 as part of his record-breaking flight from england to australia another familiar name is britain's amy johnson the first woman to make the solo flight from britain to australia in may 1930 the weather-beaten gypsy moth arrived safely in seletar despite battling the monsoon rains other celebrities to also use the base included one of silver screen's leading men douglas fairbank senior a frequent visitor was english playwright actor composer director sir noel howard many aviation adventurers and different aircraft models had made their way or passed through seletar but the giant silver word plane sunderland was the longest serving raf aircraft in singapore the word torpedo bomber was also included in the number 36 squadron and the burmese incident further saw the need to beef up the squadron thus the inclusion of the word torpedo bombers the peace time task of the air base came to an abrupt end with the onset of world war ii recognising the strength of the base the japanese navy quickly restored seletar making it fully operational and named it seletar  word  the need for ammunition caused the japanese to ship any available metal to japan including the removal of metal girdles off these hangars seletar ville continued its peaceful operations after the war the countess mounbatten of burma paid a special visit and so did the duke and duchess of word during the royal tour of the far east in 1952 the air base has gone through several phases since its completion and with the establishment of the saf training centre in june 1965 it marked the gradual end of raf in singapore initially operations at the air base were peaceful in nature including conducting of surveys metereological flights and escorting vips however incidents like the burmese rebellion in the 1930s showed the need to modernise the air base this led to the housing of local employees and later on the raf officers in an area known as seletar ville but where is seletar ville currently to find out join us after the break that in turn led to a residential area affectionately known as seletar ville found within seletar camp complex jalan kayu was named after mr c e woods the principal works and building officer-in-charge of the original air base but due to his request the malay equivalent of his name is used instead another thing that tells you 'you're here' are these guarded gates but what lies beyond them let's find out entering the complex is like venturing into another country altogether not only are there no tall buildings to block your view there is no heavy traffic thus ensuring minimum noise and air pollution what would greet you are decades old terraces and semi-detached houses built ages ago greenery and narrow winding roads take a look at some of these landmarks that should surely take you back in time seletar ville still uses most of its original road names and just rattling these names often would make it seem like you are in england instead of singapore most of the houses here are unique in their own ways and residents are able to add their personal touch to the surroundings as shown by the cute and artistic letter boxes here the plants are definitely an interesting sight which we will explore later but i was curious to find out more about the lifestyle here so i went to see april and jerry word  residents here since twenty years ago the west camp is where you will find seletar airport which is run by the civil aviation authority of singapore and it is from here that all air traffic is controlled from this relatively new tower you can actually see some old landmark particularly the old tower some of the old landmarks within seletar air base dated as far back as the early days of the raf unfortunately the original structures had to make way due to the ravages of world war ii and later further expansion the airport has had a few towers built since 1928 the current change is due to the ever expanding role of the airport that sees the need for new facilities to be accommodated thus the old tower had to be abandoned but recognising its historical value the tower though deserted still remains and taking over its air control responsibilities is this new tower the highest structure in seletar new hangars have been built to replace the old ones although the japanese removed the metal girdles off the original hangars to ship to japan the infrastructures remained and those who wish to know when the structures were built there is the date for all to see a year after the air base was officially opened the war wiped out almost everything and within the air field a little evidence remains to show just how bad this thick metal door has holes all over caused by bomb shrapnels yes the force and hear of the shrapnels melted parts of the door flying is one of the favourite past-times of the residents here however its role as the base for general aviation has taken up most of the air space sir word governor of straits settlement in 1930 was quoted to have said that singapore would become one of the largest and most important airports in the world based on what seletar airport alone has turned out he would have been proud of his prediction the services within the airfield varies aircrafts like the c130 as technician mike explains are always on standby for possible refueling of planes or cargo shipments seletar's peace time task of 60 years ago are still maintained when the need arise word or aircrafts for medical attention and evacuation like this helicopter could be counted on in cases of emergency seletar airport runs commercial and non-commercial flights although the two make up only a small percentage of the total air movement the flight ranges from regular commuter operations to tioman daily cargo flights to batam and bringing in fresh seafood for restaurants here if the original air base saw the likes of screen idols kings and ministers the new passenger terminal also has a list of whos's who many personalities have chosen seletar airport for its privacy these included mega stars like jackie chan jean claude van-damme cindy crawford and many more maintenance is still very much a part of the airport's services the availability of facilities in seletar sees aircrafts from around the region seeking maintenance at the air base with about 9000 air movements per month the air port definitely has its hands full and contributing greatly to the functioning and safety of aviation at seletar are a group of people working behind the scene just like any other airport the air traffic controllers work round the clock to ensure smooth and safe air traffic flow although seletar airport today functions as a general aviation airport the majority of its flying movements still come from flying training it also continues to be a place for young singaporeans to realise their dreams of learning how to fly the wings of singapore continues to soar with the increasing interest of aviation shown by the current crop of youngsters and all their interest began in 1928 when the republic of singapore flying club was founded although it cost quite a bit to get your flying license it sure beat swinging a golf club dennis tell us more well that's a sum that most students can't afford but if they meet the pre-requisites the youth flying club is the place for such young aspiring pilots now apart from the singapore flying club there is the youth flying club which also organises activities for schools mainly flying training and of course i am not going to miss that for the world okay i'll close the door and off we go to check out what more seletar has to offer this time taking a bird's eye view during the flight i was given a few flying tips and learned more on seletar when the raf first decided on seletar mangrove swamps have to be filled in hills removed and rubber trees cut down as seletar continues to play its role as general aviation venue for the region there has been an increasing need for space thus the area around it has been reclaimed to provide land for any further expansion plans just imagine that in seletar alone there are three golf courses to be found there is the seletar base golf course just next to the runway the seletar country club golf course and just next to yishun new town the orchid golf course imagine the sight seen by the crew of the far east flight who recced seletar back in 1927 now instead of swamp land cultivated trees lined the residential areas of ang mo kio and yishun and here it's a little trivial did you know that the fresh water at lower seletar reservoir is separated from the sea water by the stretch of land of yishun avenue one interesting ah well with some help from major leong i had a chance to pilot the plane for seven whole seconds  it was thrilling for me but i can't say the same for my very worried camera man with the spectacular view of the singapore oological gardens from the air we decided it was time to take the plane back home it was definitely a flight that will be etched in my mind for a long long time seletar has managed to retain the unmistakable beauty of its natural surrounding which hopefully will be preserved i am lisa from hey singapore good night 
Singapore	this year alone music lovers enjoyed more than twenty international acts performing live in singapore something quite unheard of before the copyright law was enforced in nineteen eighty-seven with the depletion of pirated music record companies have experienced rising sales total sales last year amounted to sixty million dollars almost six million cassettes were sold in nineteen ninety and more than one and a half million cds bought the affluence in singapore and the region has attracted more foreign performance here fans of paul simon paid between fifty to a hundred and twenty-five dollars for his recent sold-out concert due to huge demand additional rear-seat tickets were sold for thirty dollars and those were all taken up too the in-door stadium was filled to the brim in october for a strictly instrumental performance by saxophonist kenny g and just month gloria estefan turned the also fully packed stadium into a huge lively party concerts are generally regarded as the best way to market an album but concerts like all marketing tools don't always lead to huge sales figures especially in a small market like singapore among the recent concerts only kenny g's performance made a major impact on the album sales but investment in the exposure and hype of personal appearances continues because for some the result are long-term tommy page is one example most record companies release between ten to twenty albums a month but concentrate their marketing efforts on only three to five with a potential to achieve gold or platinum an album becomes gold in singapore when sales exceed ten thousand units it turns platinum when sales exceed twenty thousand and for more than forty thousand units sold double platinum posters and press ads are the usual medium for marketing new releases record companies which have big names under their label also benefit from free exposure to boost publicity and album sales but the most important tool is still the radio marketing new releases is made easier for record companies when we work with sponsors besides record companies artistes also work with sponsors to market themselves kenny g's concert was backed by coca cola and its rival company pepsi sponsored gloria estefan sponsorship in music is getting popular among mncs due to the lure of instant profits while sponsors help defray cost videos make marketing more expensive but they help boost sales especially when artistes are photogenic and can dance and move well lack of space in music stores also limits the exposure needed to market new releases but good news for record companies a new store provides ample display opportunity opening soon is the music power house singapore's first music megastore it occupies five thousand and three hundred square feet ten times the average music store over twenty thousand titles will be displayed music paraphernalia and related items like videos and laser discs make it a one stop music shopping centre marketing in music will increase in sophistication but while more megastores may appear whether they will survive in a small market like singapore or drop out is something we will have to wait and see  the songs and activities here to mark world environment day has attracted quite a crowd but those who came are mostly young well-informed about the environment and well students i didn't see many whom you would consider your regular macik and aunties i'm talking about the homemakers those who don't usually use english as a working language for them it appears that the green message hasn't really gotten through that seems to be the case from what i found out this past week i asked several homemakers with some help from a colleague if they knew for instance why this product with a green label is considered environmentally friendly although many of the women we spoke to didn't know about being green most were in fact unwittingly practicing green habits many said they sell old newspapers to the 'garang guni' man for recycling they did realise that they're actually helping to save the trees their reasons for doing it are more pragmatic rather than out of a green concern so when it comes to making conscious decisions to be green like buying this kitchen roll made out of recycled paper most would choose on the basis of which brand they're loyal to and how much it cost and as for plastic many said they were reusing them for their rubbish and garbage which again is a green move that they're doing unwittingly but many don't realise that they should also cut down on the amount of plastics they use in the first place they don't realise how plastic harms the environment burning it means releasing dangerous chemicals into the air burying it in our landfills means they wouldn't decompose for ages so many housewives are still in the dark when it comes to making a conscious effort to be green with according to the national council on the environment there's a need to get homemakers to be aware of the green movement in a letter to talking point the council went on to explain that housewives play a crucial role at the home front they make nearly seventy to eighty per cent of the decisions with regards to domestic purchases home education has also been largely in the hands of the women and they're a major influence to their children according to what the homemakers told me the reason why many of them don't know about protecting the environment is that most of the green messages are in english a language which many of them are not well-versed in and true enough i found that while the ministry of environment has multi-lingual messages during clean and green week environmental efforts by individual groups are almost entirely in english but i found this is because these groups face real constraints in getting the green message across in other languages for example the jalan hijap group an active green group which printed this useful green directory last year could only come out with an english version the group's founder mrs cynthia wee told me why i met up with mrs fatimah trazil who recently won the green leaf award for her efforts to promote green awareness she told me how else we could overcome the language barrier to reach the homemakers it's clear that it'll take that special effort to spread the green message to homemakers but even putting it in different languages is only a start it'll take more to convince them to make really green choices so we may have to think of other strategies to win over the homemakers a group which if not reached may undermine all our green efforts now  you could see chong pang city is the first shopping mall in a hdb estate gone are the usual narrow walkways the haphazard display of goods and the cramp shops you find in typical hdb shopping area instead what you get here is something quite different and if you're tired after the shopping why not come here to this amphitheatre it's right in the middle of chong pang city most of the time it's a convenient playground for the children but if you come here during the weekends i'm told you'll be treated to a variety of performances all these are designed not just to keep up with the times but more importantly to bring back the crowds and the cash especially when competition's just next door northpoint the latest offering in hdb estate shopping is only five minutes away from chong pang city and it boast major chains like cold storage john little's and toys r' us as well as smaller shops selling everything from clothes to toys to food all in air-conditioned comfort and as some would say all under one roof something shoppers have to expect along with the good bargain the result while the chong pang shops selling necessities like groceries or food stuff are still doing well those selling fashion items for example have been badly hit like madam chiang's clothing shop which is what mr loh koh choy hopes will happen he's the general manager of the retail promotion centre a committee set up specially to help the small retailer and if upgrading in chong pang can change that the government had said that other shopping areas like toa payoh will in time also be upgraded to deal with the competition but before that happens will renovation alone make a difference to chong pang and this isn't surprising a recent survey of consumer habits showed that singaporeans rank price and quality of product as very important factors while ambience was rated much lower so although chong pang city does look much better changing the facet alone isn't going to bring the crowd back what shoppers want is for each shop to sell a wide variety of quality stuff at good prices something not all shopkeepers seem to realise for instance displaying goods outside the shop may help attract customers but not if they look as if they've been there for a long time at this shop the prices seem quite reasonable but the range was somewhat limited and it certainly didn't help to display the goods this way and here it was a case of free for all but often it wasn't only the products and the way they were displayed that needed upgrading but that's not what the retail promotion centre thinks aside from the renovations it also has various schemes to help retailers one of which is the local enterprise finance scheme which allows eligible retailers to get a loan of up to eight million dollars this money can then be used to modernise or expand their business but to date few have taken advantage of the offer  since his early teens thirty-one year old lim kok tai has always enjoyed ending his day like this though he still enjoys a good run kok tai will never forget the race he took part in five years ago halfway through the race he collapsed from a heat stroke and was rushed to the hospital it was a frightening experience but nothing compared to the news the doctors had for him he had diabetes like other diabetics kok tai suffers from not enough or ineffective insulant as a result instead of being changed into energy the glucose level builds up in his blood and if left untreated this can damage the blood vessels leads to further complications like heart disease stroke kidney failure and even blindness doctor william chew head and consultant physician in the department of medicine at alexandra hospital explain why more singaporeans are getting diabetes at a younger age but while diabetes is more common among people who are overweight even someone as fit as kok tai can also get it although it's widely believed that diabetes does tend to run in the family it's still not known exactly how a person's genetic makeup makes him more prone to getting it but recent findings do point out that compared to people in australia the uk and the us more singaporeans are now getting diabetes especially among the chinese malay and indian communities doctors also know that those who don't exercise enough and who don't watch their diet stand the greatest chance of getting diabetes but whatever the cause for diabetes kok tai told me his illness has certainly affected him unlike before kok tai has to be careful about what he eats on top of that he has to regularly monitor the glucose level in his body something all diabetics have to do to keep their condition under control at this workshop at yishore hospital diabetics and their families learn the importance of diet healthy cooking exercise and even foot care to prevent infection for kok tai being able to do something about his condition has helped him come to terms with the disease so although diabetes can't be cured it can be controlled  well apart from being careful about diet and exercise there's no reason why diabetics can't carry on as they've done before at work or at play but if you think about it the precautions that diabetics take really apply to all of us after all a healthy diet and exercise is the best way to go 
Singapore	under his massive four-year economic plan to revive the us economy bill clinton aims to reduce the budget deficit by some us five hundred billion dollars over the next five years at the same time he plans tax increases totally some two hundred and forty-seven billion dollars and spending cuts of close to a quarter trillion dollars tax increases will come mainly by way of increasing the corporate tax rate from thirty-four per cent to thirty-six per cent the top rate on personal income too has been raised by five per cent individuals with annual income of above us hundred and fifteen thousand will be taxed at thirty-six per cent and for those earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars an additional ten per cent tax surcharge bill clinton plans to cut spending by a little over us two hundred and fifty billion dollars cuts specifically targeted at the defence department streamlining government agencies and domestic programmes like health and human services but he also plans to increase spending by some hundred and sixty billion dollars over four years this will go towards basic infrastructure like roads and highways he also plans to spend some us sixteen billion dollars as part of his short term stimulus package to revive the us economy the us congress has so far approved bill clinton's four year economic plan in principle at least but squabbling over spending cuts goes on between the democrats and the republicans clinton has agreed to cut spending by an additional us fifty-five billion dollars between nineteen ninety-four and ninety-eight but the republicans want more cuts and less taxes but while the bickering goes on in washington it's bill clinton's short terms stimulus package that is attracting most attention bill clinton wants to inject the additional sixteen billion dollars in spending to strengthen the economy although the economy has picked itself out of recession and grown by a staggering four point eight per cent in the last quarter of nineteen ninety-two he feels that the recovery is still weak but not everyone agrees but there are others who don't think that the huge budget deficit should be an issue bill clinton plans to spend the sixteen billion dollars on building basic infrastructure like roads highways and schools this so as to put as many people as possible back to work unless previous occasions when the us economy was recovering from a recession this time around employment level in the us doesn't seem to be picking up in every period after recessions since the late sixties employment shot up above pre-recession levels not this time in fact whatever jobs that are created are not terribly significant in fact real average hourly earnings in the united states have been falling since the seventies from a high of nine dollars in nineteen seventy-three to a little more than seven fifty today so not only are the consumers' purchasing power been deteriorating so have their confidence the us is heavily dependent on its consumer spending to keep its economy growing and the fact that it's a whopping us six trillion dollar economy there are doubts as to how much of a difference the extra sixteen billions in spending will make  surrounded by wire and wall the prison is much more than just a physical separation from the outside world deep in the bowels of this prison over two thousand inmates are locked away for crimes like rape robbery and murder most of these offenders are kept here for an average of five to twenty years as punishment prevention and hopefully rehabilitation here contact with the outside is kept to a minimum newspapers and magazines have articles about violence drugs and jail riots blank out television programmes are also censored prisoners are allowed only three hours of viewing time a day every facet of prison life is governed by rules rules that cannot be broken prisoners know that they are always being monitored through a system of charts colours and codes and out this experience each will emerge to tell a different story twenty-eight year old johnny tan was a teenage gangster his red collar is a constant reminder that he is in prison lingo a lifer and this means that his sentence is twenty years but with remission he only has to serve two-thirds of it the blue stripes on his uniform indicate that he's on special watch meaning he's monitored every minute of the day and johnny has lived this way for the pass ten years since he was arrested on charges on rape and robbery within the confines of the four walls there is nothing but time time to think time to change on hindsight johnny blames his violent criminal activities on his youth and as things word started to take control of his life overnight the teenager grew up at first glance it may appear that the women's prison is less harsh but the little touches only attempt to hide the sombre reality for some two hundred pillow inmates housed here three times a day the women have to sit in rows to be counted this is called the master check thirty-eight year old lim swee fang is used to this she has been here for the past eleven years since swee fang was arrested on a drugs charge life has gone by in slow motion far from the bright lights and busy streets of orchard road where she used to work as a hairdresser in prison swee fang has learnt to live without many things in the small cell she shares with five other inmates there is little space and even less privacy but improvements are expected with the move to the new premises next year then inmates will get more facilities like toilets but there'll still be rations underwear will be exchanged once in three months and basics like soap once a month today swee fang has learnt to savour the little things like yard time while this is a daily two-hour routine for male prisoners female inmates are allowed yard time only twice a week for forty-five minutes each for swee fang it's the chance to escape from the gloomy depth of the prison even only for a while for her yard time is the luxury other luxuries come in plastic bags every thursday this is canteen day when prisoners will get a chance to spend half their pay on little extras the most popular items are biscuits cigarettes and canned food because the precious canteen items may be used as mediums of exchange in prison inmates are not allowed to keep their purchases for more than a week inmates are also not allowed to share their purchases even for those inside there may have been a time when such strict rules about the cheap canteen items would have been laughable a time when eating food off plastic trays would have been unthinkable for joe david that was the time before prison joe was a successful businessman earning over twenty thousand dollars a month when he was arrested for cheating today he earns very much less and sometimes ends up spending half his prison pay on a can of margarine at nights joe sleeps on a wooden bunk bunk number four b alongside some eighty other inmates he also shares a communal bathroom and as far as possible he wants to be known as just another inmate he tries not to let anyone know that he is a professional with an mba a white-collar criminal and joe recently got a taste of it when he started work in the prison library according to him the other white-collar criminals were envious when he got the job apparently the most coveted one among the professional fraternity here but for joe the simple job is merely a chance to remind himself of who he was and who he is now within the walls and bars the prison is like a large pot of unwilling participants with a mix of races ages backgrounds and personalities and within the confines of the prison walls there is often no choice but to integrate yet most of the friendships formed in prison are superficial mostly to pass the time to fit in and even on occasions where real friendships do form ties are difficult to maintain when one leaves prison as a rule ex-prisoners are not allowed to return to visit their friends left behind there are also inmates who are weary about forming bonds with fellow criminals forty-five year old goh boon hock is one of them he has been in and out of prison all his life a compulsive gambler boon hock made a habit of stealing to pay off his debts this is his eighth conviction he knows what to expect and prefers not to take the risk of forming bonds in prison every night boon hock goes through a ritual of folding five cigarettes and smoking them it is his treat for the day something he enjoys in the quiet solitude of his cell and for the moment boon hock feels safe and content in his little cocoon so much so that he has even gone a step further and cut off all ties with the outside world he told his wife to stop visiting him after the fifth year with no ties the pain the worry and fear of separation disappear almost magically many have discovered this cure especially those with long sentences boon hock still has six years left to serve of his sixteen years sentence for armed robbery for him it's easier to ignore the outside until he has to face it eventually but for many others the outside remains too powerful a force to ignore for them the outside is the only real world and prison is only a temporary interruption of that real world a world which comes to them only on visiting day each prisoner is allowed two visits a month and sometimes due to the large numbers visitors may have to wait awhile for their turn at the meeting table here separated by a screen they come together for a quick but precious twenty-minute visit it is difficult to condense two weeks of news into that time and the frustration of this usually shows as the years go by and sometimes meetings are bittersweet but johnny is lucky after ten years he still gets regular visits thanks in part to his close relationship with his family before his imprisonment but maintaining ties with the outside world is not easy in any case during joe's first stint in prison his wife left him under the strain when he was in prison this time around his new wife stood by him but it did not make it any easily on his two children they can only visit him during the school holidays he had admits that it is especially difficult to keep up ties with the younger child who does not understand why he can only see dad for a few minutes a time for swee fang the experience was even more painful her daughter was only three and her son seven when she was in prison she did not see them for the first three years and when they finally came her daughter could not recognise her after visits swee fang sometimes goes back to reread her pile of letters prisoners are allowed to receive as many letters they like but they're only allowed to send out two a month by the time the letters are censored the news may be stale but they fill in gaps left behind by short visits providing words of encouragement swee fang has also amass a stack of postcards she has received over a hundred just this year alone these cards help keep swee fang in touch with changes on the outside showing her her parts of singapore she has never seen before like changi airport the mrt and even sentosa in whatever form these links to the outside world are very important to inmate  it assures them that they are not forgotten that they are still part of the family that they are still a part of the real world 
Singapore	last year american perceptions of unfair trade led to this now american frustration over trade is being expressed in the tough talk of the president the crux of the problem the american trade deficit which skyrocketed to eight-four billion us dollars last year more than half came from japan and it seems it's going to get even bigger this year china is next with the us incurring a huge deficit of eighteen billion dollars with these grim statistics washington has begun to embrace a more protectionist policy on the grounds of fair trade already the us has imposed a one hundred and nine per cent tariff on seventeen steel exporting countries then curbs on european argiculture products and the warning to japan to increase semi-conductor imports despite this washington is seeking to revive the much feared super three o one act which allows the president to retaliate against unfair traders and threaten them with higher tariffs import quotas or sanctions but even with american threats demands for more market access may face stiff resistance from the asia-pacific most specific economies are geared for export growth where there is little reliance on the domestic market when pressed by the americans to open up further specific governments will be reluctant because it would require radical changes at home the high rate of savings will have to be brought down and consumption encouraged more importantly politic interests are tied to economic interests the ldp government in japan is reluctant to allow greater access to us exports because it would threaten domestic industries like rice and agriculture a sector which the ldp depends on heavily during elections if it accedes to us demands the ruling government risks serious political damage with anti-american sentiment already prevailing a hard line us stand may spark a back clash from its trading partners another problem involves china the us has demanded that china clear up its human rights record and its arms export before its mfn status comes under review with an economic recovery on the cards the americans should be mindful of taking too harsh a stance despite the present problems asia is the fastest growing region in the world still represents a bountiful market for us exports so despite the tough talk president clinton may need to rewrite his trade policy to take into account the realities of his time  hi i'm lisa ang and you are watching hey singapore now i bet you didn't know that the king prawn d24 and the golden pillow are names for different types of durians well many of us believe that the durian is the king of all fruits but for some this thorny friend is considered the smell from hell well like it or not the durian is singapore's top selling fruit and while we may be one of the smallest nations in the world we are in fact the largest importer of durians so if you are a durian lover like me this episode is for you cos' tonight we are taking you around the island for the perfect durian it wasn't difficult at all to figure out where to begin our hunt we headed straight to singapore's durian zone if you thought that this famous area is simply a food's paradise or red light district think again just take a walk down the main road and you will see stall after colourful stall selling almost nothing but durians with so much to look at we were spoiled for choice geylang the best place to buy durians if you come here at night you will see many colourful stalls selling either thai or malaysian durians and during the durian season in july and august there will be many cars jammed up back to back on this street all here for one purpose only to satisfy their craving for durian so i guess this is the perfect place to start our search for the perfect durian there are no hard and fast rules for picking out a good durian everyone has their own theory it's said that the pungent the durian's aroma the better it's supposed to be so many buyers subject each fruit to a sniffing test others take into consideration the size and shape of the durian as well some vendors allow their customers to open up their durians its contents are then judged by the colour and thickness of flesh be warn though you probably end up paying for the opened product ultimately the only real way of telling how good any durian taste is by taking a bite feasting on durians is not merely a singaporean passion it is considered to be a social activity of sort while we were out on location, we saw groups of families and friends enjoying a durian outing together for these people the unlimited supply of durians here beats eating them at home anytime here is a tip for all durian novices out there the pick of the crop normally hangs above the stall and can cost up to twenty dollars per fruit we approach one of the durian seller to find out more what exactly does each grade of durian taste like it was time to find out right now i have four different grades of malaysian durians in front of me starting with d2 d7 d24 and d101 now i'm going to open them up because apparently each different grade has a different colour or flesh i couldn't tell the durians apart by just simply looking at the colour looks like it will take an expert to tell the difference however there are durians out there which have a unique colour like the king prawn which we will see later okay i've been certified the durian taster in this show so let's start with d2 uhm okay d2 is pretty good let's try d7 the d7 is a bit bitter that is what i like d24 uhm d24 has a bit of bitter taste bitter sweet and now for the d101 oh my i know why they called this the 101 i know why they called this the sultan it's the royalty of durians there are basically two types of durians thai durians and malaysian durians some people especially tourists like thai durians but locals like me prefer malaysian durians because of its richer taste and aroma so which is the best let's find out it's easy to tell which country your durians come from malaysia varieties go by numbers while those from thailand have exotic names we won't go any further into the mysteries of durian cultivation as long as i know where the best are that's all that really matters to me a short while later we powered our way down johore where we went looking for the state's most famous durian stall the attraction here is one of the durian's kingdom superstars the king prawn you can't possibly mistake its unique deep orangy colour and smooth texture it tasted sweet yet very tangy and it's easy to see why singaporeans flock here to eat it this is the nearest place to get the king prawn which is grown mainly in penang and since we were able to eat for all we could for 30 ringgit you can believe we cleaned out the place well it seems there aren't any durian plantations in singapore but did you know there are is in fact pockets of durian growths left in obscure places in singapore apparently people still make a hobby out of picking this fruit this area in upper thomson may look deserted to you but it's actually a hot spot for picking up wild durians our durian seller mr chua comes here often when he is free not so much for the booty itself but for the thrill of the hunt no matter what his reason might be the attraction was clear looking up into the forest canopy we saw many clusters of yummy durians all almost ripe enough to eat you also would be tempted to hang around waiting for all to drop durian hunters in singapore never harvest the fruit directly from the trees instead they hunt among the bushes for fallen fruit which wouldn't be ripe otherwise unlike wild durians the ones you buy at stalls everywhere have different grades and you can expect those grouped together to taste the same however biting into the flesh of a wild durian is always an adventure you would never know whether it would be sweet or bitter like i found out first hand once our impromptu feast was over it was time to prepare for some real action and that only happens after sunset they came armed with torch-lights these durian enthusiasts were willing to wait as long as it takes for one durian to drop most of them were camera shy but we finally found a durian lover willing to share his experiences with us all right we tried thai durians malaysian durians and now our very own local durians what else is there left to sample well for one thing people of this region love durian so much that they practically use the fruit to make all kinds of desserts from durian crepe to durian pudding to durian ice-kacang now talking about it just makes my mouth waters let's dig in it's amazing just how many desserts can be made out of durians the hey singapore team found more than 50 over durian recipes in the course of our research some were a fusion of east and west like the durian crepe i tried okay the durian crepe tasted so good that i have to bribe the assistant cook here swee lin for the secret recipe all right so what are these ingredients swee lin you would need whipped cream durian flesh and syrup add a generous helping of each into a large bowl and stir vigorously spread the mixture on a crepe but be careful and fold it till it is shaped like a wedge next add some garnishing in this case we recommend kiwis and strawberries top it all off with a word of durian ice-cream whipped cream and durian syrup for a truly sinful treat this delicious dessert is yet another example of the spiky fruit's versatility whether eaten on its own or part of a dessert it's obvious that singaporeans can't get enough of durians last year alone over 17 million dollars worth of durians was imported by singapore making us the world's biggest durian consumer market school's in again but for these final year students at pei chai secondary it's not a lesson on biology what's going on is a lesson on life skills that's a programme which covers issues ranging from old age to abortion to pre-marital sex the case being discussed may be hypothetical but its content is all too real that's why life skills was introduced in nineteen eighty-nine in covering issues like pre-marital sex the principal mrs song feels that her students will be better able to cope with the facts of life this way less mistakes will be made as they get older most schools don't follow the way of pei chai what they do is to invite speakers like dr lim to give talks but this is usually only once a year but the laughter belies the serious nature of the subject last year singapore planned parenthood visited seventy schools like the singapore technical institute where questions like can petting or oral sex lead to pregnancy kept popping up dr paul tan president of the singapore planned parenthood association spoke to producer sylvian poi problems like abortion here at k k girls below eighteen are first referred to miss santadarun and that's one reason why the ministry of health started the teenage abortion counselling programme last december with about eighteen hundred teenage abortions in nineteen ninety it was a problem that had to be looked into so what's the solution teaching sex education in schools  the problem is that many of us still blush when the topic of sex is being discussed there's also the fear that sex education will encourage students to go back and experiment it's a bold step but are we ready for it? well whether we are or not we can't ignore the fact that our teenagers may know a lot but maybe not enough 
Singapore	this is the yellow crane tower the symbol of wuhan city it's more than a thousand years old and many poems have been written about it through the centuries it's been destroyed and rebuilt many times today it stands as a proud witness to the rapid economic development of the city construction of high-rise building everywhere roads jam-packed with traffic men and women buying the latest fashion prosperity has greatly increased since wuhan opened its door to the outside world last year more than ten years later than the coastal cities of guangzhou and shenzhen but wuhan's economy grew by more than twelve per cent last year though lower than the twenty per cent achieved by the coastal cities it's catching up fast putting up a good fight for foreign money to date more than four hundred sino-foreign joint ventures have been approved in wuhan the total amount of contract signed is a whopping two point eight billion sing dollars the joint venture partners include citroen the french car maker and philips the dutch electronics manufacturer would-be investors are in china's one billion consumers wuhan is a better place for investment than the coastal cities wuhan's strategic location has made it a key link in china's internal trade located in the meadow ridges of the yangtze river wuhan stands at the crossing of the trade routes from beijing and guangzhou and from shanghai to zhongching this makes it an important hub for communications and inland transportations wuhan has a network of waterways linking it to fourteen provinces in china it boasts of the largest inland port to make it a hot spot for investments the wuhan harbour was opened to foreign ships last year goods can now be shipped to and from countries like singapore japan and europe to make it more attractive as a foreign trade centre wuhan's building a new international airport to be completed next year the airport cost about five hundred million sing dollars currently the domestic services inland flights to twenty-five other cities and weekly flights to hong kong to link the new airport to the city and to cut travelling time down to just twenty minutes a new highway will be built this is all part of the government's plan to improve the road system and help ease traffic jams already being built a second bridge across the yangtze river it's expected to be completed next year at a cost of two hundred million sing dollars massive amounts of foreign funds are needed for these projects to upgrade the city's infrastructure to meet this increase demand plans are underway to build a second power plant and to increase the number of telephone lines there may be a power shortage but there's certainly no lack of manpower in wuhan wuhan's literacy rate is one of the highest in the country it has some of the top brains too that's no surprise since wuhan houses some of the country's best universities wuhan is also china's third largest research centre for science and technology there are more than twenty thousand researchers working in over four hundred research institutions labour cost in wuhan is also relatively lower on the average a worker takes home about a hundred sing dollars a month his counterparts in guangzhou gets twice the amount the wages may be low but the people in wuhan can afford to buy big the employment rate in families is high with their combined income a family of four working adults can afford modest luxuries like television sets and other electronic goods with such buying power and a population of seven million people wuhan offers a grwoing market that's worth more than two billion sing dollars a lucrative market for retailers currently there's only a few big stores like the wuhan department store more than two hundred thousand people walk through its doors everyday and it's one of the ten largest in china last year it chalked up sales of more than a hundred and twenty million sing dollars it's also the first department store to be listed on the shenzhen stock market besides being established in retailing wuhan also has a strong industrial and manufacturing base its key industries are in iron and steel machinery and textiles the wuhan iron and steel company is the second largest in china with annual output of about ten million tons other leading industries include pharmaceutical chemical and electronics for its future growth the wuhan government wants to further develop these existing industries in addition it has also identified two other areas of growth the automobile and high-tech industries to develop these two industries the central government has earmarked two special economic zones the wuhan economic and technological development zone also known as auto-city will concentrate on the car and its related industries it should be completed by the end of this year high tech products like optical fibres and electronics will be centred in the east leg new technology development area investors in these two zones will be offered the same package of tax breaks they enjoy in the coastal cities and for singapore investors the opportunities are aplenty good infrastructure skilled labour tax breaks wuhan looks set to be the next focal point in china's boom it's a chance for singaporean investors to build on the opportunities before they slip away  all secondary schools who now conduct the normal course will be taking in these ten thousand children from the em3 classes in most of these schools teachers have yet to know who among them will be teaching these children well teachers being teachers didn't want to speak openly about their apprehensions concerning these children but from what i gather they say they know very little about these kids apart from a few horror stories they've heard from their colleagues stories which stem from one very common public perception these children for some reason or other didn't do well in the streaming exams they were placed in the em three classes and as a result branded academically slow by many with that label came others difficult unmotivated hyperactive and restless but many of these children if given the right motivation learn well teachers say that the key is to engage them in activities that interest them for example computer use in fact lessons in the new normal technical course would take on a more hand-ons and practical approach there'll be role-play games and project work the education ministry says they've also designed a special syllabus and new instructional materials for these classes mister hopday teaches mathematics in the em3 class through this computer-based learning programme young as they are iskandar and his friends know their priorities many want to work harder this year and move on to secondary school next january it's a chance they would not have had under the old school system and that's why they want to make good this opportunity but at the same time it's going to be tough going ofr most of them especially when they face certain realities of life things other children don't worry about i learn from their principals and teachers that these children lead another life outside school kelvin tan is fourteen years old and works part-time during the holidays the extra money helped him buy a bicycle his classmate velu also holds a part-time job velu works five days a week at mcdonalds he starts work after school at three pm and finishes only at nine it's not surprising then that these experiences have had an impact on the children so teaching these children demands something more from the teacher patience understanding and genuine concern and some of these children have a maturity far beyond their age especially those who have gotten into serious trouble before well spending sometime with children has made me realise this despite what people think of them many have risen above the criticisms to deal with what's the most important thing for now  everyone needs some love and romance but in our modern society it's assumed we'll choose that special someone by ourselves suggest a matchmaker and you'd probably get the reaction in this movie matchmaking is seen as something that only happened in the past gone are the days of a matchmaker or are they perhaps matchmaking still lives on only in different forms and guises and maybe we'll respond to the idea of matchmatching according to how it's presented take for example the popular game show perfect match on sbc eight people are scrambling to take part and it's become prime time televsion it's literally a song and dance in this media version of courtship as contestants try to win their perfect match game show or not there have already been two marriages and then there's love over the air waves the deejays are so identified with the programme that they've been nicknamed the matchmakers and they're often approached by friends and family to pair off couples but is only the media form of matchmaking popular not if the commercial viability of introduction agencies like these is anything to go buy this agency alone has four thousand members why the great demand for these modern matchmakers icebreakers claims a marriage rate of almost forty per cent that's giving the social development unit a run for its money they even have a mail-order bride and bridegroom service which finds partners from abroad but in this age of computer dating you might want some added assurance in finding that perfect match well that's what many people come to this man for chinese astrology george koh is often approached by couples who want to find out if they are compatible in marriage and if you think it's only the young who worry about their love live you're in for a surprise many parents are very anxious to make sure their children get married off using the traditional art of chinese face reading and chinese astrology geroge koh advises parents on choosing the best matches for their children at a cost in doing so he also takes into account the concerns of the parents as well for marriage services mister koh gets about three hundred clients a year mostly chinese and for all that matchmaking according to the stars there are some very down-to-earth profits involved but for couples who prefer not to rely on the stars there are other alternatives meet hajar sapier a woman who has matchmade almost four thousand marriages of all races for her and her husband the reward of matchmaking is in seeing couples while olden day matchmakers receive token sums hajar sapier earns her living by selling clothes catering malay food and also by doing traditional malay massage she believes it's her strong traditional ties which guide her in what is very much a traditional practice for the many people that come to her hajar sapier represents the hope of finding the right person to spend the rest of their lives with hajar sapier always tries to get to know the person well and she believes in discussing the practical considerations of finding a life partner it may take up to six months to find the right match but the marriages last a life time only one couple has split up it's not surprising then that people keep coming it seems that matchmaking still has a place in our society though perhaps for different reasons consuming careers may not leave much time for socialising or could it be difficult to find someone of the same race many matchmade couples are happily in love and some feel there is a stigma attached to matchmaking we spoke to one couple who is proud of their marriage the vargheses were matchmade in their teens sixteen years later they were more certain than ever of the strengths of matchmaking though they understand the lure of modern relationships they are happy and it shows in ethnic groups like theirs it's the norm for parents to arrange children's marriages  such was the case with the vargheses and they want to extend this tradition to their children but are there concerns that matchmaking might not always work out and most matchmaking today does compromise here suggesting a match but not forcing it as the motto of that biggest matchmaker goes and so on this valentine's night we wish every happiness to all couples in love whether matchmade or not and wish here all the matchmakers do too 
Singapore	well a very warm welcome to all of you and uh i'd like to take the opportunity before i begin to welcome uh dean uh ernest chew who is uh with us this morning uh i'm sure we all have heard of the film uh terminator two judgement day even uh if we did not part with our hard-earned money at the cinemas to watch it uh we all know what the film is about in the film uh uh cyborg uh model t8 100 that's what it's called fights it out with the latest advance in scientific devilry a model t1000 now the term cyborg is of course very well-known to science fiction fans or technobugs as in uh as they are called however the term does not occur in the collins cobuild english language dictionary even if cybernetics is explained at length in the same dictionary indeed in the film terminator the ah model terminator t8 100 spends a long time in the film explaining what a cyborg is now i will not bore you with the details as to what cyborg is since we are in technologically aware singapore however interestingly techno as a prefix to a range of terms and activities including techno societies and techno mania occurs in the cobuild dictionary now all these of course does not mean that i i'm uh criticising the cobuild dictionary or its short comings personally i find a very useful tool what i am doing is to remind us of the strategy of that particular dictionary which as its preface goes is i quote to make a feature of the most common words of the language and to pay to them very close attention it is also to remind us what its editor john sinclair notes that the dictionary any dictionary he says as a single volume quote cannot hope to do justice to the immense variety that is found in modern english he then goes on to remind us there are now whole dictionaries of regional varieties of the english language including the marquarie dictionary of australian english now we're very fortunate to have with us today very many distinguished speakers of which we have uh ms susan butler mrs susan butler of the marquarie dictionary she will be joining us over the next two or three days together with a panel of very distinguished speakers including of course dr jonathan webster who is coming in from hong kong city polytechnic uh he's not here yet but he's going to talk to you on computers and lexicography now the crucial question that is before us today i think is surely will someday a dictionary of singapore english become be the outcome of the deliberations of this workshop that's always somewhere at the back of our minds as we sit down to discuss we will also i think uh be asking ourselves will that dictionary be seen as the first step in establishing singapore english firmly as a regional english in its own right now this whole question of whether singapore english is going to be a regional english or is it going to be a variety of regional english or is it going to be a series of colloquialisms is invariably going to be a thorny problem some will argue that singapore english is to be distinguished from singlish that is singapore english as it is spoken by me as it is used by a whole lot of people must be distinguished from singlish and others on the other hand will argue that to do so is to be ideologically prejudiced in favour of a certain group of people i think next few days there might be much debate and i certainly look forward to the many varieties of opinion that will be forthcoming however let me exercise the unfair advantage which i have by virtue of opening this conference and uh say that while we may debate ideology we should never allow it to stand in the way of making progress even uh small steps there are many things that can be done even as we are discussing ideology questions for example like how we can begin the work of establishing a corpus of english as it is used in singapore indeed of the region especially malaysia now in some ways the work of corpora building has already been started by the department there is the international corpus of english that the department is supporting headed by professor nihalani paroo nihalani as the principal investigator and uh with his team a/p prabhu and dr anne pakir in addition to we will also have to work out the whole business of the design of the database that is going to need particular attention among the difficulties i can foresee is that while most dictionary databases privilege a text base lexicon we may find that a substantial portion of lexical items in singapore malaysia are speech-based for precisely the reason that there are not that many texts in singapore which will lend weight to this kind of uh naming or emphasising another important factor will i suspect be the relative unimportance of the traditional distinction between lexical and encyclopaedic information indeed in singapore a constant cross-over between the two may in fact be desirable in a dictionary dealing with the workings of language in a regional context all of these will i think demand answers and in some cases decisions and uh some of these may begin to emerge over the next few days of course in many ways while the designs storage and retrieval of lexical databases have improved by leaps and bounds some things have not changed there are many similarities between any dictionary-making even in the twentieth century with that of dr johnson's two and a half centuries ago with any dictionaries you still need helpers although nowadays we call them research assistants rather than the word that johnson had we don't tell them this is what to do we ask them to go out and do research you will also certainly need funding which johnson as you know found in robert docksley and uh his consortium of book publishers you will also have to make a decision as to what books to go in uh what items to go in and what not items to go in now it's useful in all these to remember what johnson conceived a dictionary to be for him the dictionary he wrote in his famous plan was above all to be an useful book it had the task of helping the reader to use words and to understand the words of others a dictionary was also he wrote in a subsequent preface a reflection of lift experience the kind of experience that shapes language words are like men he tells us and he says quote when they are not gaining strength they are generally losing it though art may sometimes prolong their duration it will rarely give them perpetuity and their changes will be almost always informing us that language is the work of men a being from whom permanence and stability cannot be expected i suppose that's why we do not have one dictionary we've many many dictionaries but also johnson reminds us in this way that to make a dictionary is in many ways a record of the lives the conditions and the aspirations of the people of the society who use words i think this is a serious venture and it need support and careful thought now the department will continue to support the and to extend work in uh the various areas of corpora building it will forge strong and i'm sure fruitful relations with institutions and bodies like marquarie university and marquarie database and it will initiate and promote work being key areas in the usage of the english language in singapore at the same time i hope that today's workshop will be the first of a series of annual department seminars and uh activities some of these workshops will hopefully attract funding from cas while for others if they are more related to wards publishers we may hope to find yah support from publishers and other bodies finally the department will like to thank the various speakers and uh to the dean for gracing the occasion we will also like to thank the dean's office and the centre for advanced studies and in particular its director a/p ong jin hui for supporting our workshop we will also like to thank john wiley for his grant and gesture of support finally my thanks go to dr anne pakir and the team of workers for once again providing a meticulous piece of organisation thank you enjoy the workshop  ah thank you anne now uh anne's little poem from stella kon reminds us that the study of words uh begins above all with the study of man and his environment no matter what lexicographers do and uh what we call ourselves there must be above a love for words what has emerged over the last few days is the immense scope as well as the immense opportunities of the task of singapore dictionary making the problem as susan pointed out in the first day is not just with getting a dictionary out that's the first thing but also the vast amount of continuing research citation and collation that will have to be done after that because as i told susan just now it's very likely that the first dictionary that comes out is almost immediately going to become obsolete people will say ah but there you are you know you don't have this word and that word so the first dictionary will very much be a testing ground for subsequent dictionaries there will be a there will have to be a number of dictionaries before a stability is achieved now here i think the university is in a good position to bring together to initiate and to extend the continuing work of corpora building of collation citation and so on in this connection we hope that the conference will do at least two things there is an interest in starting a small group of people interested in works and in lexicography that is to carry on after this conference is over and uh uhm a title suggested for such a group is lexispore which is a combination for lexicography and ah singapore it might not be uh uh bad term especially when you think of spore as a building point yah not uh uh a malevolence spore or a benign spore for starting and growing something so you know the department will support the work of such a group it can include people like rosemary who has been uh doing uh a lot of work people like ismail tony people from the ministry ah anne ivy and so on uh and all of you all who are interested the second idea of course is to take the idea of getting a dictionary together a step further now the question here is how much will the cost of such a project be that is the cost of produce producing a dictionary against the cost of putting together the corpus the designing of the database the paying of the research assistants and so on it's not just the final product but also the whole thing of assembling the team that is why i have suggested that perhaps a shared multitask corpus with interchangeability and interinuseability be ah looked at very carefully because if you have such a team ah of people interested together sharing together the work of corpus building then it becomes that much easier now uh there seems there remains it seems to me some hesitation over the corpus of the dictionary as to what eventually it can lead to i think that perhaps we may look at it in terms as a continuing progress  if we think of a dictionary we're not thinking of the just the first dictionary we're thinking of at least a decade's work i think before something like a final or stable dictionary can come about i think that we are looking at least in terms of three dictionaries hem to start with perhaps a history of or dictionary of singlish a collection of words which fascinates people and ah which we are trying to put together to give some meaning to secondly you are thinking of a dictionary ah which can be useful for students and to the educated public and thirdly you are thinking of a kind of defining dictionary something like the singapore version of the oed now these three objectives may change over the years we do not know until we start work uh we are as i say thinking of at least a decade's work at any rate i think the decision whether to go ahead or not i think in some ways rest upon people like you the department can support the department can initiate but if in some ways you find that it is necessary put the group together start lexispore for small for in small way and then we can begin ah talking in the meantime also the department will hopefully be exploring with interested publishers and also with other funding authorities about how far we can take the project i'd like to thank you all for being uh such good participants thank you 
Singapore	i'll talk enough i think now good morning uhm now the a to z i think i'll prefer to call it z and not z a to z of singapore life actually is a modest attempt at compiling a glossary of the commonly heard terms and expressions used by singaporeans in everyday life using susan butler's classification or lexicographical works it would fall into the category of singaporean it is a one-person effort something is uh myself to accomplish as a way of educating myself as well as others about singapore language and society this alphabetically arranged compilation is intended to help the foreign visitor or expatriate resident who often finds the singapore variety of english puzzling it is aimed at a general readership which may find this a handy guide to dip into now and again i remember my own experience in britain when i was given strict directions and told to look out for the lollipop man before taking the next turning i wasted some time looking out for a non-existent ice-cream or sweet-seller before it suddenly dawned on me that this referred to the traffic warden nearby who was holding the large traffic sign like a giant lollipop in australia i often wondered why there was so many no standing signs which forbade people to stand on certain parts of the road i also felt sorry for poor bill posters who was going to be prosecuted everywhere the sign read bill posters will be prosecuted these i later realised were the australian equivalents of a singapore no standing and stick no bills conversely the foreign visitor or local expatriate resident will be confounded by singaporeanisms in the following ways either he does not know the meaning of these words or takes them in their literal sense or is not aware of their full semantic coverage for example in the talk of singaporeans even the meaning of eggs is not all that straightforward there are black eggs which are a chinese delicacy also known as century eggs red eggs which have a special symbolic meaning because they mark a baby's one-month celebration salted eggs sometimes salt eggs a food which is eaten with porridge and which's often regarded as a poor man's meal and the idiomatic duck's eggs telor in malay which is what we threaten pupils with when they get all their sums wrong even baby's one-month celebration in singapore is not the same as the baby's christening in the western sense since the occasion also signifies the end of the chinese mother's confinement and that she is clean to return to normal duties and participate in religious and temple practices although the confinement taboos are not so prevalent today it is useful nevertheless to know the significance of baby's one month celebration thus the a to z will include entries like baby's one-month celebration and confinement amah or servant take another example porridge in singapore is a bowl of plain or savoury rice gruel which can be cooked with small pieces of meat or fish it is very different from the oatmeal porridge served in western breakfast to which milk or sugar is added then there is also the myriad number of words that are of non-english origin but which constantly pepper the talk of singaporeans giving it its distinctive idiom words like the colloquial rojak gilah kiasu kaypoh and coined words like moneytheism kiasuism the often frowned upon slang words like sabo zap stylo ichified bluffology pathology and the expressive particles and exclamations like lah loh meh alamak aya ayoh etcetera singaporeans may well find some of the glosses useful singapore has changed so quickly since its independence and a move towards economic development urban renewal social progress and national defence has led to the introduction of many policies schemes campaigns and concepts we have generated a whole new crop of terms and expressions in the last twenty years or so fresh words singapore colloquialisms constantly emerge among the youngest set the national servicemen the undergrad and the yuppies so that the older generation the so-called elderly person in singapore this is someone over forty may well need a lexical guide to help him unlock the meaning of the new patio as the a to z is intended to be a visitor's handbook it also includes descriptions of famous buildings and personalities institutions customs public events and awards and titles festivals items of food and clothing references to current campaigns and programs and a common abbreviations and acronyms that has gained currency in everyday talk so the glossary should enable someone to understand maybe a sentence like you should wear the orchid dress to the swing party and dance the kimo kimo most of the entries have been gleaned from conversation overheard in buses shopping centres hawker centres at the work-place and at family reunions the range of communicative situations reflected are thus diverse gossip polite talk argument quarrels instructions jokes sales encounters and uh oral sources mainly as these contain plenty of examples not a few are derived from the printed medium expecially the popular new paper local cartoons and also from introspection which i found most invaluable i take heart from tony hung's remarks that a person born and bred in singapore is the best informant in short the a to z compilation encapsulates the very facets of the singapore lifestyle in the words expressions and names that express them now the easy part of the task was the description of well-known landmarks places and people and there were a number of sources one could refer to the problematical part was the selection of the language base entries to be included in the compilation the items used to refer to sing's ideas and concepts so my discussion here is confined to the selection of the linguistic entries in order to be in line with the interest of the workshop now the question as to what to include entails asking questions like which words are considered singaporeanisms should taboo expressions be included what about the malay chinese words which crop up so frequently in singapore colloquial speech because they are so expressive and for which no english equivalents equivalents can be found with the same force of emotion words like gerum where the english frustrated or even frus the local frus are but weak substitutes there are just so many of these cross-borrowings that a decision must be made at some stage as to the cut-off point should the whole range of particles and exclamations be included since they occur with such great frequency particularly in the singapore basilect signalling the various degrees of agreement disagreement and rapport as my work is only half way through i'm leaving the task of final selection to the end at the initial stage my decision was to cast a wide net and to take in as many items as possible all was grease that came to the mill i will have to be fairly drastic in the end so as to prune it down to size i don't foresee this to be very easy since the vocabulary is intended for receptive use and not for production and so warrants a wider coverage and there is no attempt at prescriptivism words like trishawthon moneytheism ichified will probably make it into the final list however words like born she born a baby bring come or fetch some of the uh items referred to by dr ho mian lian and handicap for handicapped person will probably not be in as uh these are more grammar and pronunciation errors and their meaning is fairly transparent and matches closely that of standard english now the main criteria for inclusion is that there must be clear evidence that the terms and expressions are in general use for this i rely heavily on my native competence of singapore english now if i had not heard the term or expression before i would randomly ask two or three people if they knew the meaning of it and base the merits for its inclusion on that basis a word like bus train very evocative bus train now this really refers to a long line of buses jamming the bus stop not many people know about this so the status is dubious there are about 700 linguistic entries so far and the compilation is still growing albeit at a slower rate now to give you a general list of the entries i shall uh give you some examples for each of the classification under which they have been categorised the categories are not mutually exclusive they are a means for catching as many words as possible i believe dr ho chee lick in his paper tomorrow words in a cultural context will be discussing the arguments for including some of the categories mentioned here well the first categories words or census which are common use in english but which originated from the countries where the early immigrants came from these words are normally to be found in any standard english dictionary as they have been accepted as part of the english language attap kampong sarong haji kati sampang malay words chinese or chinese origin kongsi samfu towkay and indian origin sari chattiah tambi tobi hindi words for this category of item there is a problem of how to depict their spellings whether to use a regular spellings that have appeared in dictionaries or to use the present orthography so as to be in line with spelling reform or language policy changes i felt that it would be a good idea to provide both variants for example the malay word kampong kampong or kampung belachan belachan or belacan and the chinese words char kway teow or chow guo tiao yong tow foo or niang tou fu where dialects spellings have given way to hanyu pinyin versions in speech however the dialect words still predominate in a number of situation for example char kway teow presumably these refer to food items which are popular with the older generation which are dialect-speaking providing both spelling variants is a good idea since although the reader uh so that the reader can then recognise the words when spoken and also uh read the signs at the food centre the words have come into singapore usage more recently do not pose a problem like feng shui feng shui spelling pretty straightforward here taiji also uhm the second category will be words used in english but have a different meaning in singapore usage this is probably the category most likely to cause confusion to the newcomer in singapore here i have kinship terms used as polite address terms and do not necessarily indicate a blood relation like auntie uncle brother sister time reference terms every time just next time last time this time whole life and terms expressing a judgement or opinion this is really interesting because of the singaporean's habit of understatement perhaps part of his total kiasu philosophy now we have in order uh in uh terms of uh degrees of from good to bad very nice and good really meaning excellent so if a singaporean says ni nice good very nice that is really excellent now alright can do okay so so that means good not very good merely means satisfactory and bad to very bad they have these terms lousy hopeless useless gone case now the other category would be that ah it's a mixed bag i haven't classified them this is still under number two missy for nurse in general english in singapore english missy is nurse contractor we say my contractor came to do something really means the decorator slept late means went to bed late elderly i mention someone over forty the gloss may well change as perception of age changes with improvement and health standards and people remaining young longer now third category words spellings or senses used in singapore english not but not part of the english language  outside singapore and malaysia these can be further sub categorised into words used in ma singapore and malaysia but not sup but not outside often considered as slang whose use is mostly in colloquial speech now words like exsi ichified bluffology some of these words have chinese stems like hiao becomes hiaosified parto cantonese partology didak didakparthy how here there's a class of local words which express a verdict very interesting from slang to howtah logek shiok bolehtahan macham macham perhaps you may not agree with the classification as lsang but then this is again debatable and in hokkien lowya now b idoms idiomatic and figurative expressions now this collecting this was most interesting idioms in english in singapore english like no head no tail half past six bottomless pit his grandfather's house pull strings father's scholarship idioms in malay in use in singapore english chinak bukek guching gurak ikan bilis percha lobang tarek harga of course you have their equivalents really in the english idiom percha lobang is actually spill the beans you know they have an equivalent idiom in english in general english percha lobang literally translates from malay to tear a hole or something like that tarek harga to stretch the price in english it'll be play hard to get now chinese from chinese you have chiahchua literally eat snakes but english in general english would be play truant liam geng laugh liam geng that would be recite a prayer literal translation in english similar equivalent would be give a lecture that in standard english bao ga liao very interesting bao ga liao meaning everything included package deal everything included part of his kiasu philosophy chap zai literally mixed vegetable uh idiomatically it's a mixed bag that kind of thing mixture and ngiao very interesting too onomatopoeic representation of a cat sound very ngiao i think but it translates into bitchy or caty but it's more bitchy actually well another one uh english versions uh where the english some exist in both the local version and singapore english like in malay you have paly play main main translates into singapore english play play both versions come into singapore you can say don't main main ah don't play play okay hah his big mouth he mulok besar make noise ah bising bising ah shake legs goyang kaki both versions hokkien tripod sar kar tripod he sar kar you know he tripod uh catch no ball liap bo kew okay both versions rice bin peng tang vomit blood tor hui now another category the fourth one terms and expressions used to lepict depict local practices customs campaigns sports crafts local food housing education the environment uh in short the folk ways and lifestyle of singaporeans they comprise a collection of english chinese or malay words whole list year customs and festivals a few examples of each feng shui red eggs ? ceremony paper houses red packet ten course dinner mass wedding etcetra under schemes we have coupon parking three-quarter tank rule red light camera thirteenth month allowance plus plus plus 10 plus 3 etcetra institutions i can't find um or singapore stereotypes really the saingapore girl perhaps samsui woman death houses food and food ingredients this is um quite common char siew fun banana leaf curry etcetra utensils wok kwalis steamboat fruit and vegetables starfruit jackfruit etcetra local fruits rambutan durian vegetables kai lan kang kong etcetra clothing that's common enough orchid dress comes in here uh or or orchid print games sports and gambling the local sports selak goli taiji chatek sepak takraw five stones chogek mo modern rongeng gambling four-d chap gee kee architecture interesting reflecting the changing environment hdb life void deck terrace apartments point block intermediate terrace bungalow condo executive flats flatted factory shop house five-foot way environment mama shop coffee shop um all the abbrevia many abbreviations kimo kimo mono wok sdu coe posb gift program now expressions which depict character stereotypes are in black and white amah not just amah amah also balck and white amah samsui woman the singapore girl centrepoint and mcdonald kids latch-keyed children new generation mps the old guards onetwo-three-four man one-two-three-four singaporean the ? graduate mothers filipino maids masaleh expressions which describe human traits attitudes and emotions kiasu kaypoh kiamsiap yaokui this's hokkien cantonese we have hamsap malay we have kayu katao geelah ayam lo loyaburok english we have loud mouthed chicken feet cheapskate tripod oily all sorts uh miscellaneous under this category of ragbag again catered food branded cooked food touting copy watch black market now exclamations and particles which convey attitudes and emotions exclamations like the whole list adoey alamak ambouy chilakak or bochok siow this is not a definitive list i have much more now exclamations uh particles i won't go through we've got enough of the particles already but three items under exclamations which seem to me to be interesting why don't i put them in because they occurred in my corpus when i was recording classrooms in singapore i have thirty-one tapes on classsrooms and these there were times when i had to assign a meaning to these exclamations like yeeee yierh wha now the teacher waa asking soliciting for questions you know what did the boy see when the spaceship landed and the one of the uh pupils said oh he saw a man ah come out and he had a green face or something like that and the pupils in the class in chorus all say wha wha you know now what did that mean it was an expression of actually gentle protest or wonder or whatever but this is a very common exclamation yeee again is very common expression of horror yierh not so much horror but perhaps dislike so degrees from wha ? yierh and then yeeee that's the worst kind i think the most intensive now this whether it will finally go into my list or not i have not yet decided but i'll just recorded as i said the initial thrust was to bag everything now the items in some of the classifications are particularly susceptible to change while the exclamation alamak is still of common currency others like obochok and kusemangat are heard only among the older generation of peranakans whose language is fast disappearing these i expect will fall into disuse in a few years' time as the peranakan elders pass away the entries will have to be revised regularly already what was a half-tank rule when i first started my entry was half-tank rule now i've changed it to three-quarter tank rule the third child is another entry which has to be given a different gloss in the light of policy change in population control the one-two-three-four singaporean will probably also change because of the changing singaporean philosophy you know on-two-three-four man one wife two children uh three-room flat and four wheels unless the characters stereotypes attain the status of institutions and form an integral part of singapore's cultural history like the samsui woman and the black and white amah even what is currently accorded some sort of institutional status like the singapore girl may have to be weeded out eventually the award for example queen's scholar was replaced by president's scholar when singapore had its own head of state and pirate taxi has probably been erased more or less permanently from the immediate memory of singaporeans who used to take this trans this form of transport not too long ago instead of pirate taxis we now have photocopy pirates well as far as i can foresee the task of compilation is one of on-going revision and updating thank you 
Singapore	alright i shall try very hard to pay heed to pay heed to my topic which is how to structure dictionary entries for what and la or lah and what my first reaction and it will be a reaction which will be with me for a long time don't do it it's not possible and it's not uh it's it's almost like a rhetorical question okay i had originally thought of using as a title for my talk he las las who las best but since i had to include what i've had to forgo that frivolity perhaps i should change the title of the talk to he las las who las best what  laughs  but i will indulge in a in another frivolity maybe i shall play uh dick lee's song say lah in his latest orientalism album mainly because i think you've been working really hard at the workshop uhm run by conducted by susan and you should take two minutes off just listening to the words of the song there's a handout which should be distributed because the words of the songs uh of the song uh can be found there we must have also a parallel belief the notion that that system can be described needs to be described and it's worth describing but how does one go about doing just that foremost word only standard and formal singapore english be codified or should we need to include spoken or colloquial spoken uh singapore english my focus in this very short presentation i hope will be two discourse particles lah and what and on the references that i've given out to you you'll find that there are lots of people who have attempted to describe these particles one to eleven and for number eleven it's another ae done by one of our students alright we have the problem of definition if you look at that workshop that you've just done if you turn to page eleven for the lexical entry headword lah what can we do to describe this uh discourse particle if you want to have a definition in terms of a linguistic analysis we can say oh yes definish uh discourse particles well they're also known as communicative particles pragmatic particles modal particles etcetera and these are not really lexically there you know they are empty morphemes they add communicative meaning to utterances they modify the meaning of sentences or they express emotive attitudes of speakers the word speakers is really important because i think that's where our problem is if we're going to codify this and under language label it will be colloquial spoken and uh just harking back to dick lee's song singaporeans many of them speak with a sing-song alright and uh we had a discussion yesterday with anna on tonal and intonational uh information given in the use of discourse particles well we'll find that the main problem lies with speakers it's not what you say it's what you really mean and it's not how you say it only how it seems uh i think these words even though they may seem very light lyrical uh words are words for us to ponder on in terms of discussing this very difficult uh task of entering uh meanings for this colloquial uh uh spoken form what or lah i think identification is less of a problem the problem would be how these discourse particles are used differently by different speakers what what do i mean by differently by different speakers we had an invitation i don't know how many of our uh language honours uh supervisors are here who had the same invitation that i had uh dear dr pakir come lah for what high tea with us lor where ah seminar room as5-03-20 when uh second august 1990 thursday time leh 5 to 6:30 pm come hor alright uhm obviously this is an invitation to join the honours class for tea but they have very uh wittily included this as part of the invitation how many of you received this same invitation as it did you no okay it's made oh you did you did alright okay did this this uh indicates to us that uhm the particle used is accepted even at tertiary level honours year's students etcetera uhm i didn't really get to uhm you know i i i called one of them up and i said can let's let's match our meanings come lah what do you mean by the lah there and she said it's friendly persuasion alright for what uh and i said you know i would say what for usually alright why oh high tea with us lor and i learnt this lor with a high rising uh movement because i've learnt to to do that in the in the most recent uh years that i've been back in singapore because it's a new particle that's just come in where ah as a question nasalised i may not have the tone right because i don't speak this particle from the viewpoint of a chinese uh hokkien speaker or a cantonese speaker etcetera when ha as a question marker and time leh she says to me uh she said to me uh with the time leh how how do you say it time leh see i've to learn it i don't know it alright okay time leh augh and i said what do you mean by this particle and she said well it it's almost confirmed that you're coming and you're just asking for the time alright and i said what does what about this one come hor and she had to explain to me how to say it come hor come hor come hor to indicate some degree of intimacy alright i think among the particles here lah and what as observed by uh ho mian lian and john platt are the ones that are used by speakers of english who use english as the dominant language who are higher up the sociolectal scale the kind of skill they have and therefore should pose no problem but the new particles are the ones that are a problem and obviously if i were to pull off another student they might give me a little more than just uh a a little different interpretation of some of these particles alright just a little not too much so the uhm identification is not a problem we can say they're usually not obligatory they do not occur independently as units they are frequently found in sentence-final or phrase-final or clause-final positions their meanings are tied to intonation and tonicity they're not unifunctional and not uniform in their representation or meanings for example anna kwan terry discovered that there was a short lah and a long lah her analysis of it of course she has changed her mind about i think but generally speaking the short lah would be something like well you might be going end of this year right ya possibly hopefully if everything is together lah alright and the long lah would be they're picky right they want honours grads no lah ya lah alright that's the long lah first we have to under identify the multiple functions served by lah and what and determine their context of occurrences what does this mean it means we can't just go to the coffee-shop and you know overhear one conversation jot it down let's have a meaning for this there define it you know there are multiple functions and the context of occurrence would be a very important factor uhm in fact platt ho platt and ho in world englishes said in a situation such as singapore where english is used by such a wide spectrum of speakers from those with minimal to those with very competence and where ethnically chinese speakers use varying proportions of english mandarin and the localised southern chinese dialects it would hardly be surprising if there were considerable variations in the use and functions of the various particles for some speakers they may function as in chinese while for others they may be mainly the carriers of the pre-pitch movement alright so uhm the the fact that these particles are code-markers which serve to you know indicate intimacy rapport solidarity and so on would be accepted quite readily but what other functions wilma marie who has done quite an exhaustive uh list of uh functions said that for lah you have the function of conveying the obviousness of something for lah you have the function of conveying a sense of suggestion especially to soften the tone of something which may sound like a direct command then thirdly you have the function of expla explanation reducing the tone of harshness or hardness in giving explanations she discovered some new functions such as dismissing some unimportant part of a continuous utterance like whatever lah fifteen sort of thing lah and all the jazz lah there is also a fifth function of that of deflecting and denying compliments as in you know if someone compliments you and you say no i was lucky lah uh and compliments you again not really lah alright if you tell me that this workshop is enjoyable and i said not really lah uh you have another function such as conveying a lack of enthusiasm as in chinese new year ah okay lah alright in the work done uh most recently by my ae student chua siew cheng who did a very exhaustive study of the what particle i think she had two hundred examples gathered from all over singapore from isetan parkway parade from uh many of the places where you know spoken discourse can be quickly recorded and then transcribed she had many examples of the use of what uhm in her sample she found that it's normally spoken with a falling tone only 14% of her sample showed that it had a rising tone and that coincided with the question form use of the words right let me just flip through the overheads quickly so that you can see what she has done if you can't see it from the back i'll just quickly read it quickly to you i insisted that uh the context should always be there and the tape recorded should always be on so that she could find out whether the pretonic and the tonic was there and she did that and she found that as i said in her data almost every time when you had objection what you know like very tired lah here can sit don't want so dirty people also sit what alright people also sit what so that is an objection what now this is an objection what which could also double as an explanation what in my opinion but she doesn't seem to think that she wants to put that in and she says oh the context is a inquiring where b is attending a particular lecture 'a' you going for lecture ah then must go what alright this is another case in plaza singapura in the lift lobby uh a says but envelopes company got so many envelopes b says application letters cannot use company envelopes what oh ya alright this for her is an explanation what why are you standing here for my wife inside there what my wife inside there what there is another one where one of the salesgirls is displeased with another colleague and she said so what this is the pejorative one it's found in in utterances that are usually uh overheard on the university campus here and this is one that was uh quite clearly so you know this peter so what one i ask him to help me with my tutorial and he says your funeral ya he damn what one laughter  this is the pejorative one and this is another example of explanation what so expensive this for charity what this is an assertion what  according to her analysis test on wednesday whole book ah die lah holidays never study never mind lah got two days what another example where it's pretonic and then the falling on the tonic what i think you can take or you can go down to b2 and you take up probably singaporean way of kiasu ya that's why ks style what then there is the persuasion what uh in b is offering a a spoonful of the sundae which b has just bought and a says i don't eat this lah b says everything you mst try what everything you must try what and this is the ex persuasion what there is in her analysis uh comment uh a comment what uh this one blanket this one quite ok what this one nice what ok then bye it's only a gift i have to rush through this because we don't have much time now this is uh this will be when you find that the the tonic the the movement has the pitch movement has changed when a is asking her friends about their subject preferences major what econs and what soci major what  laughs it goes up with the question form this is again you stay in halls ah got contact number or not why then can contact you lah contact me for what another question form what with a rising intoning uhm this is an indefinite what with a rising intonation also today is reebok day or what and in discussing what to eat a says you want what anything rice better alright ok i've run out of my transparencies now but you have an idea of how difficult it is to uhm to describe the functions of what because of the very many possibilities that can be uh i i guess that are meant by the particles and it depend very mcuh on whether these particles have their source their etymological sources in cantonese in hokkien in mandarin or in some forms of english yearn smith's article indicates that he thinks the what sh uh what in singapore english has come from the british what in some in some cases and you can look at his examples if you are interested now there are issues and problems of course uhm i think the conclusion that has been made is that the functions of discourse particles in singapore english has still by no means being fully resolved and we have also to to be very clear whether these pervasive particles used in spokens uh uh speech of singaporeans around us reflect uneducated speech or the informality of an educated speaker what we do recognise of course is that lah and what are are the ones that appear consisten consistently higher up on the sociolectal scale as i said uh platt and ho have uh claimed then of course there are other problems such as the problems well anna brought up yesterday in terms of lexical tones carried by the chinese and intonation that is uh uh a very characteristic feature of spoken english everywhere else and in singapore too alright so it would seem that in addition to their functions of uh semantic or or functions of communicative and attitudinal uh aspects they have also they are also carriers in terms of discourse intonation so uhm the problems remain when we talk about particles we also have to ask questions which platt asked three years ago or four years ago to what extent do these particles function as a speech community indicator or as stylistic markers and then are they uni or multi functional so this would of course be questions we want to attend to if we want to suggest that lah and what for example deserve a place in a dictionary that we would produce here now if lah and what and other discourse particles should merit inclusion in a dictionary for singapore how should we structure the dictionary entries for such particles uhm i have i guess i said no at the beginning but i think because of this exercise i have to do something and i did the sample dictionary entry for what the definition as found sorry is that for what for lah sorry ok both of them ya ok for lah let's let's look at uh the sample dictionary entry for lah and i say the entry is incomplete is dependent upon a large corpus of spoken singapore english which we do not have at the present time uh if we use the headword la then we'll have to give the alternative form such as lah or any other forms that are available i think that's only the alternative form in terms of spelling then parts of speech it's it's difficult to define it at the moment i i said you know maybe tentatuvely why don't we just call it a particle we can call it a modal particle discourse particle pargmatic particle and so on and the form features you usually find it sentence phrase or clause final but it's not always so because it's if what for example is used as an objection marker it can come out uhm uhm at the beginning sentence initial rather than sentence final let me see if a says oh you only had two biscuits for tea then b would say something like what two three alright it's an objection uhm then you have the pronunciation uhm the data from 200 samples here indicate that it's often with a falling intonation stress and you you put that down but what do you do with the other cases where you have a rising intonation and when you have it unstressed etcetra in terms of language label maybe you want to talk of it as being informal scratch out the other informal or you can ask whether it is a limited representation of spoken language whether it is uh educated speakers no speech of english and singap speech of english speakers in singapore or uhm in the speech found in the spoeech of everyone in singapore but it has it's uh meaning in terms of whether that the person is educated or not then definition is impossible at this point because of very many possible meanings uh the etymology maybe chinese languages found in singaporte and malaysia and some evidence that it's comes from malay too for lah usage notes would have to go in there now for what i guess you have to define what in such a dictionary with the kind of definitions that we use what the educated english speakers of uh uh the english educated speakers of singapore use what in the ways that some uh i mean uhm most british speakers would use what as uh taken from maybe the oxford learner's dictionary the longmans dictionary collins cobuild etcetra you know interrogative seminar interrogative pre pronoun and so on but then you would have to have a what four or what five or what six or what seven which would have to incorporate all these other meanings that you find here just here in the colloquial spoken variety definition again is impossible at this point because there are possible meanings and it carries this function that function depending whether it is stressed or unstressed whether it is long or short you know protracted or contracted whether it has a falling intonation or a rising intonation etcetra but for usage i guess you could say that uhm for example in what you use what this is the cobuild's approcah you know get a huge corpus and then list down eleven uses or twelve uses of what you use what one point one in a retort to convey disapproval or to register objection to a suggestion or complaint you use what one point two in a retort to convey annoyance in patients' irritation number three uh onepoint htree in refenrence to an action or a viewpoint attributed to a third party onepoint four to share information one point five to show agreement onepoint six to show up what is oviously so and you can keep on listing all these possible uses and then you;ll have to say what what functions as you have seen objections with a chaalenging note expression of obviousness with impatience and irritation expression of in indignation expression of boldness or definite opinion etceter etcetra would indicate only individuals whose solidarity and familiarity are high would use it among themselves and never at the formal level howevere ofr uneducated speakers of englihs language fromality concerns do not seem to matter much all sepakers of singapore english use the what particle in their infomral conversations with friends and family members thus a feature of informal singapore english in conclusion i would say that since there are so many problems with discourse particle analysis in singapore english we amy have to postpone a decision a final decision as to the kind of animals these are and forgo making a commitment to the multi multiple functions served by them for example lah and what can serve as linhuistic in indicators of the singapore malaysian community they can also serve as linguistic markers where as sociolinguistic variables they show up stylistic variations then again in another sprial up they amy become stereotypes which becoming the cause of overcomment may carry stigmatisation and therefore will drop out of use in time furthermore the pitch and tonicity problema have not been quite worked out a task requiring a vast amount of the spoken english vernacular in singapore when these are available and acoustic and instrumental analysis may help determine the pitch movement and the tonicity attached to the different meaning carried by the particle so i end this short presentation by saying i shall withdraw those steps i won't begin on this task thank you 
Singapore	 address by guest speaker dr cheong choong kong managing director singapore airlines ltd  mr pro-chancellor graduates ladies and gentlemen my very first words and indeed all my words from here on are for the graduates for whom we're all gathered here this afternoon congratulations i will not repeat what others might have declared from this rostrum on occasions like this namely that i wish i were in your place to start all over again kknowing as i do now the pitfalls to avoid and the opportunities to seize no errors teach and enrich and although you must think ahead and plan your career never grieve over a wrong turn in your path or despair if it takes a little longer to find your vocation but while i have no wish to begin afresh i'm still filled with envy as i look at you all the hopes the ambitions and the confidence that is written on your beautifully unlined faces the many years you have ahead of you and on top of it all literally on top of it all those luxuriant mops of hair i'm consumed with jealousy having accepted the invitation to address this convocation i was pleased to learn that my audience would be composed mainly of graduates in the sciences and mathematics people of like discipline and disposition as i with whom i can readily empathise surely i said to myself with more than 20 years of working experience there was much i could say that would benefit those about to leave academia so three weeks ago i sat down to prepare my speech determined to pass on the fruit of my years of accumulated wisdom to my utter disgust and frustration i discovered i had little to say apart from the usual platitudes that was humiliating because doesn't that mean my post-graduation years have been uneventful and unenlightening containing little of note fortunately for my self-esteem the answer is no what it does mean is that there exists no easy principles that apply universally to everyone regardless of personality time and circumstance therein lies the difference between the friendly academic cloisters that you've been accustomed to and the realistic theatre of life my message to you today is that there is no message in real life there are no pat answers that assure you of a passing grade in physics at least in undergraduate physics you adopt a model of the universe and on the basis of this fixed model develop your theories make your observations and draw your conclusions in mathematics you work from a given set of postulates from which you derive theorems through aristotelian logic until you change your model or your postulates you live in a comfortable world of orderliness and predictability all that will change as you step out of these hallowed halls of learning into the turbulent climate of commerce and industry and yes even the civil service out there nothing's axiomatic and you play by an uncertain calculus that changes as you move from one job to another between one boss and the next intimidating enough to make you stay in the university a few more years doing post-graduate studies not necessarily while most if not all of you will have little use hereafter for non-euclidean geometry and the abstruse equations of theoretical physics and while the same is true for much of the examinable syllabus of the science faculty all is not lost or wasted the ability to analyse to draw logical conclusions from observed facts and agreed assumptions and above all the acquired confidence to absorb unfamiliar facts and learn new theories will put you in good stead in any enterprise even marital ones i found one word of warning any acquired skill unless regularly practised atrophies the ability to learn is no different and the intellect unless it is sharpened through constant exertion dulls if i have only one piece of advice to give to the young graduate it is that he must never cease to learn he must be relentless in his quest for new knowledge and a better understanding of his surroundings and he must apply to this endeavour no less rigor that is demanded by the disciplines of mathematics and the physical sciences but logic isn't the alpha and omega the be all and end all logic and the power of analysis are necessary conditions for modern living but they are far from sufficient rational thinking i'm told occurs in the left half of the brain which is better at functioning in a sequential manner the right half tends to operate in a simultaneous fashion much like parallel processing in computers image recognition aesthetic appreciation and intuition are governed by the right neither hemisphere is fundamentally more dominant than the other and which half is used more often depends on the type of functions that are emphasised given the obsession of our society with science and technology and your kind of training in an examination-oriented system that leaves little time for mental exploration beyond the syllabus i'll be surprised if with few exceptions the right halves of your brains have got enough exercise this is a pity because good performance at examinations should not be achieved at the expense of creativity don't knock intuition or gut-feel as the americans call it when newton saw the apple fall and archimedes screamed 'eureka' as he jumped out of his grecian tub it was the right halves of their brains that flashed subsequently of course the left halves had to be put to work to construct more precisely the laws of gravity and floatation but only subsequently these stories are apocryphal but not so those of kekule who grasped the shape of the benzene molecule while day-dreaming in front of the fire and coleridge who composed kubla khan in his sleep coleridge of course was no scientist and neither was mr raymond chow the movie producer who made bruce lee famous mr chow told me he did not call for sophisticated business analysis to convince him that ninja turtles would make money indeed rational arguments would probably have deterred him from his investment after all who wants to watch slimy green turtles emerging from sewers as it turned out millions do and mr chow is so much richer because he respected his gut-feel the founder of ibm thomas j watson was famous among other things for the sign in his office which read 'think' he should have added with both hemispheres' a proper balance between the cerebral hemispheres is necessary just as the totally irrational person hobbles along on mental crutches a liability to himself and others the clinically rational person who distrusts intuition inflicts upon himself an unnecessary handicap and misses a lot of fun rational thinking must allow for occasional diversions into random unstructured reverie to discover and create while intuitive insight must be complemented by logical arguments which perform form and structure for it to be communicated can i be so bold as to suggest that the truly educated person is one in whom the two halves of the brain function in synchrony the truly educated person is well-balanced in thought and behaviour not for him the extremes of the religious fundamentalist or the dogmas of the ideology instead he opens himself to new ideas however strange and opposing views however unpalatable i fear that the trouble with many of our newly graduated is their total conviction on so many issues as if the text books they read and the examinations they passed have conferred infallibility self-confidence is useful particularly in the young but overwhelming confidence can lead to prejudices and bigotry we must not forget how ptolemy's geocentric universe was replaced by keppler's heliocentric one how newton had to yield to einstein and why einstein's general relativity must eventually give way to a unified theory of physics how can we be absolutely certain of anything when we must deny what's so clearly obvious as the solidity of this rostrum before me but we all know that this rostrum is mainly empty space that is nothing the wood consists of molecules the molecules of atoms and atoms are no more than elementary particles separated by enormous amounts of space are there even particles or just waves as i rest my hand on this rostrum i don't know where flesh ends and wood begins even if you've never heard of heisenberg the years in university should have instilled in you a sense of uncertainty feelings of intellectual humility and a guarded scepticism against every new guru appearing on the political economic or religious scene remember some of the principles of duality and accept that diametric opposites need not be mutually exclusive and annihilating like wave and particle relative and absolute capitalism and socialism monopoly and competition nature and nurture private enterprise and government ownership hot and cold yin and yang left and right what the university has taught you is only a start an opening to greater discoveries let me as i come to the end of my speech leave you with what so many ancient sages have said which is that the truth lies not in the stars and the vastness of outer space but in ourselves and the ordinary things around us wisdom is and here i quote my favourite lines by william blake  to see the world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower to hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour what more can anyone of us want   address by mr c r rajah president singapore law society  mr pro-chancellor graduates ladies and gentlemen after six years at primary school four years of secondary two years in pre-university three or four years at university and all the moments of doubt and even pure panic along the way here you all are this morning more than five hundred graduates ready to be well and truly convocated today you receive the degree scrolls that formally proclaim your graduatehood so what is it to be a graduate are you any different from who you were before yes you are and i will tell you why as a student there were no expectations of you other than a hope that you would pass your exams your graduation has changed all this your intellectual capacity is now no longer in question and your ability to stay the course no longer in doubt you have proved yourself your graduation has clothed you with a new status there are now great expectations of you whether you like it or not whether you deserve it or not unless time tells otherwise you are now regarded as a responsible and respectable member of society someone to whom problems may be referred to for solutions from whom leadership will come and in whom others may trust and as surely as night follows the day when others look upon you and treat with you with new respect and regard you yourself will change to grow into and accommodate the new position your graduate status finds you in this change will come faster for some than for others but for all of you it starts with your graduation will the mantle of graduatehood change you for the better i hope it does how do you ensure that such change will be for the better i wish i knew the whole answer to some of you your enhanced status might go straight to your head time and your own conduct will find you out others will soon have little regard for you the rest of you will grow to fulfil in lesser or greater extent all the expectations we have of you but all of you in the end will have to find your own answer armed with the principles of truth and virtue that have been instilled into you over the years and as an educated person which you should by now be you have one great responsibility to yourself and to society always to think for yourself to make up your own mind you have been taught to do so and trained to do so at the university continue to do so through life apply your mind to a problem and find your own solutions of course there is no point in re-inventing the wheel  where you can get help or advice from a person with experience or a book always do so it will save time but always make certain that you understand the basis of the solution or advice offered in the course of your working life whether as a lawyer scientist or whatever else you might turn your hand to you may only be a link in the decision-making chain the final decision or view taken may not be that which you hold be prepared to re-examine your own views and to adjust them if you are wrong the greater the reputation of those whose views differ from yours the more you should be alive to the possibility that you may be wrong if not in whole perhaps in part and if you are wrong learn from your mistakes there is nothing wrong in an honest mistake those who have never made such mistakes cannot be prone to holding a view or taking a position but do not make the same mistake twice if after all your re-examination you still believe you are right then stand firm maintain your view hold fast your position it does not matter if your view does not prevall remember that just as you feel convinced that your view is right there may be others who feel just as strongly that your view is wrong and their contrary view right respect their honest views as they should respect yours agree to differ but until you are in your own mind to your own knowledge on your own reasoning and by your own instinct satisfied that you are wrong you must never never abandon your own truth for that of another maintain your intellectual honesty and integrity and the same spirit of inquiry and reason that has carried you through the last sixteen years and brought you here today will take you and all those who travel with you through a life where you will always stand tall my warmest congratulations then to each of you and to your parents guardians teachers loved ones and all those others who have in one way or other touched your life and helped to turn you into the flower of our youth 
Singapore	i'm going to use what kirpal singh used yesterday and unfortunately he's not here to see this to hear this he's a friend and and an old classmate i'm i'm going to use this thing if ever it exists called a publisher's licence which was what kirpal singh used yesterday when he referred everything to poetic licence uhm i have the unadulterated unqualified luxury this morning of making a vote as a publisher on whether you know you could produce a book of standard singapore english as a dictionary ah and without uh having to ask whether you would like to find exit or not or whether you would like to work as part of it but first of all my vote and then what i'd like to do is after i've told you what i ah how we feel as a house in respect of uhm the existence of us a dictionary of standard singapore english i'd like very much uhm to consider its usage how it would be done how it could contribute or not contribute to i think it would contribute to the development of fiction singapore fiction singapore creative writing and in a wider scope south-east asian writing which is the field that we are particularly interested in and how it would uhm uh play its role in the creativity and the originality as a development of such writing and eventually whether it would assist this kind of writing travel it's over and good to say that i would like to use a word shiok but it's not much good if your word shiok is not as understood as the word in jewish writing uh you know i think you would all of us who want to write or who are publishers writing one type of writing to export and to travel can you hear me at the back and then finally what i would like to say is i'd like to say i'd like to postulate and uhm if i can within the 10 minutes susan has allocated uh i ask you if you feel that this notion of singapore writing can itself in itself take its place amongst some very large movements of writing that has hit that has its it's absorbing the minds of english language uhm publishing and english language writing in in the western world particularly in english language writing in america and in english language writing in uk and continental europe and in australia and new zealand but first my vote and of course we would like to see the existence of a dictionary of singapore english secondly what we would particularly interested in is the fact that it would act if it were produced in the same original size of the marquarie dictionary as a standard or a touchstone and a comparative one we hope against british english and american english and oh what i would like to see is but it would act as a touchstone for us uh uh a basis of comparison uhm a use of measure and in many ways if a kind of standard or or albeit whether it has to be updated or not of how english has been used in this region and i wouldn't entirely like to confine that to singapore because a large amount of the writing as some of the researches have noted have come from malaysia and south-east asia in the region in particular in english language writing or english language translations of dutch or indonesian writing in the early days but i think an unqualified yes because we would like to see for example its etymology as simon so rightly pointed out and we'd like very much for it to be part and parcel of the cultural identity and something that is absorbing the minds of many people in the government but this dictionary we feel uh would contribute in great extent to that identity and uhm that notion of what kind of what i'm a singaporean but what is a singaporean and we feel that that would go a long way towards contributing to that in the development of fiction writing in singapore would the last ten or fifteen years early english language writing began with the british of course you know and with a large amount of their impressions their nostalgia their their feelings about uh south-east asia the chinese and the singaporeans here now though in the last eight or ten years we ourselves you know in the pursuit of singapore writing and south-east asian writing have been publishing and we have within our editorial ru uhm room will tell have had great disagreements about what we can publish what we will publish what we can and will not accept and we've uh we have ourselves seen us change our points of view haven't we our opinions on the use of uhm what i've learnt yesterday was called a borrowing and i'm all for the usage of borrowing uhm we have borrowed from malay and chinese what i'd loved to see is to see us borrow from the dutch to a great extent like a word like or even from mandarin which uhm which i think in the longer run would be a language that would give you a uh greater amount of degree of sensibility and uhm and and sensuousness and a greater length of poetic language that you can use uhm much more than say malay could you know down the road but i think a a dictionary if produced would lend itself and uhm would be a useful tool and a useful touchstone in that particular area the next question really to ask ourselves is uh whether words like or words like sayang which was used yesterday uh would enter in the english language the way a word like serendipid uh serendipity does uh we're hoping that would happen but down the road if that is to happen uh your book your story your fiction your writing your singapore writing has to travel has to export uhm it has to would be exported and be backed by either a publisher or a house or an institution in in the national market that is not our own i'm not sure if that would work at the moment i uhm i see some positive signs although i think it would be gradual and it will grow in concentric circles from the region but i hope that singapore would be the nucleus of this sort of of idea finally the important thing to think to think about is uhm singapore writing using standard singapore english whether it would be whether we would could consider that down the road it could be a corpus i'm not immediately now but could it the kind of corpus that african writing is the jewish writing is in america or indeed that overseas american born chinese writing is grabbing america now i think those were the issues uhm that i would consider and within me and us in particular uhm as a fiction house  now thank you anne i think that you know when the time comes to organise wicc2 uh you may consider an additional question to the list of things to ponder and i would like to suggest this question do you want the anti-climax of a standard closing address at the end of the workshop and if the answer is a resounding no i think it will come as a great relief to me  laughs  but since i have uh receive your marching orders so to speak i shall have to press on somehow uh in my singaporean fashion now ladies and gentlemen you may recall that at the opening of this workshop uh dr ban kah choon began by referring to the movie the terminator and its science fiction terminology well now at this final session i find myself playing terminator to this workshop perhaps i should say terminator 2 since i'm only a stand-in for the director a/p ong jin hui who is uh presently out of town which explains why a political scientist has been called upon to make the closing speech at a workshop on lexicography well the day before the start to this workshop i was actually on the borneo side now of the south china sea basin coordinating or rather helping to wind down a workshop on regional security in the post cold war concept it seemed to me at the time that a lexicography workshop couldn't have been more distant from our preoccupation with great power politics but having sat through some very interesting and fascinating sessions of this workshop i must say that i have learned a lot uh from the remarkable similarity between the underlying issues and uh i am beginning to hope that more of my colleagues in political science could have been here at one level we at this workshop have been reflecting on the fragmentation of empire in this case the fragmentation of the language of an empire without making it too explicit we have touched on the international phenomenon of pluralization and the drift towards regionalization and multiplurality there is also an unmistakable ideological dimension to the ostensibly simple question of whether there ought to be a dictionary of singapore english the rhetoric of those who forcibly argue for a change in the ground rules whether ground rules governing the selection of words for inclusion or the ground rules of right pronunciation all that rhetoric is reminiscent of the rhetoric of the north-south debate and having listened to the comment by dr this morning i am intrigued to compare the fate of english with other international languages do other empires strike back to rebind the language that is increasingly regionalized i wonder what would have happened if the french rather than the british were the colonisers of singapore will we now be renovating in style our dominant language the way the vietnamese are renovating their economy a point was made that eight years ago a project such as this would have been quite unthinkable yet others have observed that this effort at corpora building reflects an aspect of national assertiveness greater confidence maybe national identification maybe even a growth uh of a middle-class while agreeing that ideology should not stand in the way of progress i think we should nevertheless be conscious that many of the questions that revolve around the central issue of a dictionary of standard singapore english has political implications or connotations why should we have such a dictionary in the first place perhaps that question has already been overtaken uh by the events of this very workshop but then we shall have to ask who should have a hand in deciding what should be included what is such a dictionary intending to serve is it to be simply a record of regional english within a particular multi-cultural setting at a particular period of time the kind of zoo or supermarket situation that we were reflecting about or is it to be the final arbiter of what is acceptable singapore english here in lies the issues of official status respectability and legitimacy things that political scientists are very fond of talking about then again we can ask what other implications of such an enterprise for those in other disciplines who have the great essays written in english to be sure ideology must not stand in the way of progress but i am also reminded that those who cannot read the writing on the wall must pay for their political illiteracy whichever way we go from here the fact remains that there is a wide spectum of interests in the subject of this workshop and this is clearly indicated by the very strong representation of the government sector in particular the ministry of education the private publishing sector our sister institutions of higher learning ntu nie relc ngee ann poly and so forth  and also of course that bastion or outpost depending on how you look at it of english the british council of course one can say that this is the kind of subject that everyone in the arts and social sciences and beyond should be interested in language afterall is the indispensable currency of social interaction but it takes a specialist and a particular kind of specialist to tell us how to structure dictionary entries for discourse particles like what and lah and lor and nei and in the course of an afternoon we were also exposed to transitivity structures we considered mood adjuncts and delve into the meaning of finite verbal operators side by side by other exotica like theme rheme and mood residue fortunately we were told though in a quite different context don't be concerned by the complicated appearnace of these terms however simple words can also be rendered ambiguous by the social cultural context i think and this can be particularly maddening in the language of intra-asean diplomacy a colleague of mine who was here this morning but uh who is no longer here is fond of recounting a recet incident in which the malaysian prime minister mahathir attempted to solicited to solicit support for his eastasia economic group idea from president suharto the reply from the indonesian president i will look into it which in the javanese cultural context was as good as saying no perhaps we can reflect on this kind of cross-cultural perception in our next dictionary of asean english but whether we go on to bigger things or settle for a dictionary of standard singapore english or one covering malaysian-singapore english the important thing is that with this workshop we have at least taken a tentative first step and here i am pleased that the cas has in some very modest way been able to support a very useful project i should also uh acknowledge in this connection the financial contribution given by john wiley & sons i would like to thank susan butler for sharing her marquarie experiences with uh with us and for her very active contributions uh to the department of english language & literature special thanks uh for its consistent and strong support and also of course i should acknowledge the untiring work uh of our co-ordinator anne pakir i think after this workshop she should at least have the confidence that when she goes back to the cas for furhter support and we say we will look into it she needs only interprst that in the singapore cultural context thank you ladies and gentlemen 
Singapore	basically i'll discuss on two topics the first topic is the use of singapore literature in relation to the singaporean dictionary of english and secondly i'll discuss the top ah uh i'll discuss the topic of the users of the dictionary in relation to singaporean literature in english uh i do not know if i've much time for the second part of it but i'll try my best uh uh say what i want to say uh in regard to both topics there is a long established tradition of using works in of literature as a source for citations in lexicography the arabic lexicographers in the eighth century for instance included citations from literary works in their dictionary and what has been regarded as a first of the big dictionaries of modern standard languages an italian dictionary published in 1612 is based in words of almost exclusively on exception from the foreign time writers of the fourteenth century when it comes to lexicography in english from dr johnson's dictionary with his various quotations from literary works of english and of the oed and its supplement and webster's considering the long established tradition of the inclusion of data from literary works compilation of dictionaries it does seems odd that apart from the panel discussion just now there is only one people out of twenty in this workshop which deals with literary works and lexicography literary works are even more important if one considers the inclusion of quotations from them in the dictionaries' citation files without their actual inclusion in the dictionary itself it would thus be of interest for us to look at some of the general conceptions of principles involved whether explicit or implicit selection of lexicographic data from literary works as looking at these conceptions of principles may help us to gain a clearer understanding of how one may use citations from literary works in the lexicographic files in relations to singapore english and of deep potential problems that one may encounter here towards the end of my talk i will also discuss the needs of the users for dictionary of singaporean english in relations to singapore literature with reference to the use of literary works in lexicography maybe use it may be helpful for us to look at the principles of selection of or attitudes towards data from literary works as it was practised in the compilation of the supplement to the oed robert birchfield who is the general editor of supplement has mentioned about his decision uh to include the vocabulary of our greatest modern writers in the supplement among them ts eliot virginia woolf evelyn waugh wh auden and even dylon thomas and james joyce except for most of i thought the lights would be off but anyway's still on the the quotation from birchfield is interesting in relation to what he implies rather than what he's explicitly stated in my view there are at least three important implications in what birchfield has noted firstly birchfield's decision to include the works of our greatest modern writers indicates the evau the evaluative bent in his selection of literary works from which he collated his citations and touches on the important question on whether the lexicographer should engage in a prior evaluation of the standing of the author or of the quality of his or her literary works before deciding to include quotations from the works in the dictionary citation files although i initially wanted to disagree with birchfield i have come to the realization that this problem is unavoidable even today in 1980 for example noted that the conception of the good authors has come to stay and cannot be neg neglected in any lexicographic file this principle of selection may be especially important if the language or variety of the language uh has a great number of literary works this may not be the case with singaporean literature as yet but some kind of prior evaluation of the works may be necessary so that the lexicographer is not inundated with data of ephemeral significance some highly regarded literary works may continue to be read many years after their publication and the lexicographer has a duty to explain a very high percentage of lexical items found in these works in this relation of a member of the lexicographic team has some prior training in literature and is capable of arriving at an evaluative decision of works to include or exclude in looking for data for the dictionary lexicographic files this principle of selection may be crucial if the lexicographic project one undertakes has a limited scope secondly birchfield's decision to include the works of our greatest modern writers indicates the restriction to economical works from the british isles which reveals that even a premier dictionary of english language such as the oed has has its cheap interest the desire to keep a written record of language and culture which centre on the british isles but there are bound to be less the thus there are bound to be less citations from literary works by american writers when compared to citations from british and irish authors except for an author like ts eliot who lived in britain for a good part of his life and one suspects that there are even less citations from authors writing in english from other countries of the british commonwealth when compared to those from bri british and irish authors this revelation by birchfield makes the decision to embark on a dictionary of other varieties of english uh apart from british standard english including a dictionary of singaporean english even more urgent as the oed and its supplements can never give us a fair picture of english as it is spoken or in this case as it is written outside the british isles thirdly the decision to include even dylon thomas and james joyce when the important exclusion of much of heeningan's wake touches on the extent or limit of the exclusion or otherwise of the creative use of the english language and lexicography the creative use of english may include nonce words or formations which appear only in certain literary works and virtually no where else in this connection some of the neologisms created in the heyday of ying mao chin for instance may have to be excluded as they probably do not appear elsewhere in singaporean english but literary works may have an influence on the language people use and some nonce forma formations especially in popular literary works may eventually find their way to everyday language for example the word taximan can in catherine uh catherine lim's the taximan's story i suspect would be less likely to be included as part of the singaporean english lexicon had lim's story not been published as the lexical item taxi driver or the word taxi as a sus substitute for taxi driver were definitely more common on the other hand arthur yap's use of the verb intercept as a noun in his poem banyan tree and conversion of the noun drought into an adjective by adding the ed suffix as in droughted traveller in his poem the meeting are more likely to be nonce formations not found elsewhere in singapore english one major reason for the inclusion of citations from literary works in the lexicographer's citation files is the fact that many literary works that needs traditionally and as we know them today are examples of or as in the case of poetry and drama have a permanent manifestation in written language the fact remains that the main source of data in lexicography is still the written in the words of the lexicographer sidney landow dictionaries are not based on spoken language there are preeminently records of the written language the situation today has not changed much in 1986 for example benson and noted that the best dictionary houses has citation banks for written english but are just beginning to use spoken citations as lexicographic evidence there has been criticism amongst linguists or more specifically linguists with an interest in lexicography on the practice of including mainly citations from writ written language when when collating lexicographic data we have seen jo foley for example criticising this pro procedure on the first day of this workshop but as susan butler and other lexicographers have pointed out the collation of data from written language has an enormous practical advantage over those from spoken language while not denying the importance of data from spoken language especially when time and generous funds are available citations from written language are not only easier but also cheaper to collate it may be countered that the dependence on written language may be applicable only to the main native varieties of english but the caribbean english dictionary which is a dictionary of a non-native variety of english was according to gustav planned to be based mostly on printed texts and quotations from such texts written texts also have the advantage of giving the lexicographic information from in terms of virtual stem of having arrived as far as the language or dialect is concerned both practically and psychologically spoken words seem to hang in the air so to speak whereas written words have a sense of permanence about them this sense of permanency is even stronger when we are dealing with literary works especially with works which are highly regarded as they are unlike newspapers or magazines which are hardly read a few months after their publication thus birchfield's desire to include the vocabulary of our greatest modern writers is not merely an insupportable preconceived value judgement but has a practical value in giving the lexicographer an idea of lexico items which have premanance or durability in relation to a language or dialect as highly regarded literary works are read several years after their publication although it must be added here that we cannot say for certain at present which works of singaporean english literature will be read fifty years from now or whether a canon of singaporean literature in english which will ensure the survival of some works is being developed or institutionalized associated with the feeling of having arrived in relation to uh to the written language is the fact that written language gives the lexicographer an indication of how words are spelt the problem of spelling colloquial le lexical items which have not been written down has incidentally touched on by rosemary khoo in her talk yesterday in relation to this we must mention here that it is likely that colloquial lexical items which have not been written down will make their first printed appearance in the literary work and thus the use of literary works in lexicography will make the task of including these lexical items in the dictionary easier the lexicographer who insists on including lexical items which have not been written down may have to resort to the international phonetic alphabet or some such phonetic alphabet and he or she may have to resort to this means as the only means of spelling of the dictionary's main entries a practice which is quite odd to say the least or the lexical uh lexicographer could do something worse than this he or she could invent the spelling of these words using the letters of the romanized english alphabet even if these words have not appeared before in a language like english or its varieties and dialects this may not be viable as english spellings not phonetically based the appearance of colloquial words in the written form in literary works would thus be of immense help in giving the lexicographer an indication of how these words are spelt or the actual uses of the language or dialect we may also note that singaporean literature and english has the advantage of being a living literature with a growing number of works this gives the lexicographer more data to work on than a dialect which does not have a written literature  some singaporean literary works in english are also quite popular over the years some local collections of short stories such as catherine lim's little ironies and philip jeyaretnam's first love had 5 figure sales and in the recently concluded annual festival books for examples some of the recently published local literary books sold a few hundred copies per day according to the figures released by the festival organisers in fact some of the books such as rex shelley's shrimp people and gopal baratham's sayang have sold 4000 copies each during the the exhibition and these two books in fact deserve more than just a passing lexicographical mention as shelley's shrimp people has a useful glossary of lo local lexical items at the end of the book and gopal ba uh gopal baratham with his book hoped that the word sayang will not only be part of singaporean english which uh many of you agreed yesterday is uh it is already a part of but uh of international english as well this is a hope inciden inci incidentally which is uh uh perhaps shared by shirley hew uh just now uh due to their popularity local literary works may not only be a reflector of the english used by singaporeans but may possibly have an influence on the use of the language in singapore a factor which i mention earlier in relation to catherine lim's the taximan's story in spite of their advantages literary works may also present problems to the lexicographer these problems however may not be universal lexicographic problems per se as i mean as as i can see it of course when it comes to lexicography i am just a layman or universal problems one encounters whenever one uses data from literary works but i suspect these are theoretical and practical problems which may be either created or solved by the kind of lexicographic work that one wants to compile and i think this has been emphasised by susan butler just now and the time of information that one wants to include in it they there may also be problems in relation to the nature of language in general and the language or dialect that one is dealing with in particular the kind of dictionary that one deals with may hinge on whether one wants to include an encyclopedic information this inci incidentally has been mentioned by dr ban in his opening address it has been discussed uh yesterday by the workshop participants and whether the lexical items should be arranged conceptually as in uh thesaurus and not merely alphabetically the kind of dictionary that one deals with may also hinge on the extent of the dictionaries thoroughness exhaustiveness or scope and on its uh intended readership and i think this is the precise point made by susan butler just now the pre the predetermined scope of the dictionary may determine for instance whether citations from literary works or citations in general should be included or excluded if they're included then they become rather scholarly like the oed or websters intend international version in this connection i have also mentioned earlier that the prior evaluation of literary works may be crucial for dealing with a dictionary of a limited scope i would be dealing with the potential user of the dictionary of singaporean english in relations to singaporean literature later in my talk but we may mention here that the intended readership of the dictionary may be a highly specialised one in this regard the dictionary of english as it is used in singaporean english literature or more general dictionary of singaporean english as it is as it is found in the literature it's an academic likelihood which may possibly be re be realised in the not so distant future the type of information to be put in the dictionary which in turn has been predetermined by the scope of the dictionary may centre on the question of whether one should include information on collocation grammar slang and so on one may also consider whether to indicate if the lexical item belongs to standard or non standard singaporean english usage or whether there is a regional variation on the lexical items used that one should decide whether to include information on regional variation may seem bizarre at first sight but uh uh uh most of you have uh attended some of the earlier sessions and you know that this is uh uh a problem which uh anyone dealing with uh uh singaporean lexical items face the primary difficulty here of course is uh the distinction between english as it is spoken in singapore and english as it as it is spoken in malaysia uh and in fact this problem is in fact compounded and not helped by the fact that singaporean literature in english and malaysian literature in english are quite often taken especially in the past as one literature and not as two separate literatures for example edwin thumboo's three collections of poetry the flowering tree seven poets and the second tongue publishes respectively in 1970 73 and 76 or include poets writing in english from both malaysia and singapore in spite of the fact that all three volumes were published after singapore's separation from malaysia even today the general commonwealth literature still discusses singaporean and malaysian literatures together in its annual review studies of the literatures of the two countries i suspect that the lexicographer of singaporean english cannot simply ignore the earlier works in english by malaysian writers such as mohamed haji salim lord llyod frenando as there did not seem to be a sharp division between both the literatures in english and the english dialects of the two countries until recent years i myself picked an example from the poem by mohamed haji saleh earlier in my talk in order to determine the possibility of his inclusion in the singaporean english lexicon however certain lexical items may mainly occur in malaysian english and not in singaporean english such lexical items should be labelled strictly as malaysian as has been suggested i think yesterday in this workshop and not simply excluded especially when one is dealing with a dictionary which has a wide scope as one cannot entirely preclude the possibility of the occurrence in the english spoken by singaporeans one possible solution to the singapore-malaysia problem as has been sug suggested by susan butler and also by i think uh anthea gupta is to have a dictionary of both singaporean and malaysian english in one volume another linguistic factor which may prove either to be a help or hindrance to the lexicographer oif singaporean english using singaporean literary works in english is the codification of the standard language as far as singaporean english as a non-native variety is concerned now many of the workshop participants have discussed this and many of them agree that the standard for language or variety of the language goes hand in hand with a dictionary of the language or variety 
Singapore	friends this election is not about a mandate for the pap or for even mr goh chok tong the pap have 41 seats they have the mandate and they are the government for another 5 years if you can believe their promises this election is now about whether we the people of singapore will be able to send a few opposition members to parliament to perform the correct role and job the opposition should make the political system that we have in singapore is based on an assumption that there will be always at least two parties in parliament if there is not then checks and balances which the system provides will not work effectively there will be no harmony in parliament there will be no balance it is not enough to have one opposition mp that is like asking one man to hold back the river or the sea by himself he can do nothing but if there are others to help him he can build the wall he can build the dam and stop the water how does an opposition mp do this he does it by getting the support of many singaporeans he explains why a government policy is a bad policy or could be improved if the people support him he can speak on their behalf and with many people behind him the government must listen and they have listened before chiam see tong and j.b. jeyaratnam went to parliament we the people had no voice there was no today in parliament ministers did not explain policies to you and me the government just told us what we had to do and fine us if we did not do it they used to force people to cut their hair in the sixties and seventies they used to tell people what sort of t-shirts to wear they told women who work in the civil service not to wear pants or slacks to work there was no consultation and no feedback they never held dialogue sessions with you in the past those were the dark ages now things have changed they know that they must listen to you because if they do not there are opposition mps who will make your voice heard we now have a slightly more open and freer society it is not a gift from the pap it is a necessity you the people of singapore made them change by putting opposition members in parliament we now in the middle ages of our political development but we must come into the modern world we must have a modern political system to match our modern economy we saw what happened in the sixties and seventies when the pap was the only party in power they did not listen and if there is no opposition the pap will not listen to the voice of the old and the sick who cannot afford the new hospital and medical charges over a year ago the pap introduced a hospital privatisation scheme they said we will the hospital more efficient but they did not tell you that they will the hospital more expensive and their efficiency in the pap bible name pay and pay the opposition members of parliament warned that this will be a great burden on the poor and those people who were chronically ill the pap removed nearly all the c class beds now they have discovered that we were right and in today's straits times the pap say that they are prepared to look again at the health policy the old premises and assumptions can be looked at again why should the policy be reexamined again unless it was wrong in the first place let me give you an example a lot of people who passed away many years ago were of people who are dying now in potong pasir a lady came to me she was unable to pay her conservancy charges her husband was dying of bone cancer she herself was sick her daughter and her son-in-law were working at two jobs just to pay the hospital bills and the husband was only a c class patient i asked her about her medisave she said we have no more medisave they cannot pay their bills i am very sad to say i was not able to help her but this is the position of many people in singapore it is very frightening to get sick if you are the sole bread winner the only earner if you fall sick your family can be thrown out into the streets to poverty and if there is no opposition the pap will not listen to the voice of the non-graduate mother whose children do not have priority for registration to the best primary schools isn't it unfair that the children of better-off families whose parents are more able to afford good tuition and give their children a good study environment should also get priority for schools where is the equality do you realise that if he was 6 six years today goh chok tong would not get priority in primary one registration because his mother was not a graduate if mr goh chok tong really believes people-bonding if he really believes that the well-off and the successful must come back and help those who are not so well-off how can he let such an unfair system continue and if there is no opposition the pap will not listen to the voice of the working mother who is paying a high levy for foreign maids so that she can go out and earn that little bit more to make the family's ends meet there are a whole range of issues where we need an opposition in parliament to bring out the issues to question the pap these are matters like independent schools the independent schools are not necessarily a bad thing but should independent schools be allowed to take the best teachers away from the ordinary schools universities we had a 100% increase in university tuition fees recently and they had 3 increases since 1987 you have of course heard of the half tank rule now called the three-quarter rule watch out it will soon be the full-tank rule and higher hdb parking charges 25 dollars to 50 dollars now all of these things i have just mentioned have something in common they all happened after a general election i think it is very strange that when the pap offers to give you back your own cpf money in medisave or medifund they said wait vote for me first i need your mandate then i will give you your money but they never ask you for your mandate when they take money form you this is a real double standard think about it they never ask you for your endorsement when they take money from your pocket i have said that mr chaim see tong that this election is not a general election because it does not affect who will be the government there is no need for the pap to get a mandate to rule they have it already mr goh had admitted this and changed his tactic he now says he wants the people to endorse him he says that he is the issue in this election not medisave medifund edusave but he goh chok tong he says that it is his open consultative style freer more liberal singapore i don't know about you but i think there are still so many rules and regulations binding us all the time i haven't seen much of this more liberal singapore maybe the only thing we have seen are the r movies that's all and even this they are thinking of changing mr goh hints to us other people have hinted to us that if you do not support goh chok tong then the pap are hardliners might oust him in a coup maybe this is why mr goh has changed his campaign slogan in the middle of a campaign he added a little word for stability mr goh chok tong has been watching too much cnn television he thinks he is president gorbachev maybe he thinks bg lee is going to overthrow him what happened in russia is a lesson for us here it shows that the people were not prepared to allow a return to one-party rule there even when they have to look at tanks and armoured cars in their face it was the democratically elected opposition that saved mr gorbachev and the soviet union from his own party hardliners i am talking about boris yeltsin who for many years has been the strongest critic and the strongest opponent of mr gorbachev but it was this critic and opponent who climbed on to the russian tanks condemned the coup and restored democracy to russia not members of mr gorbachev's own party the lesson for us is that you cannot place all your trust in one man whether he is called goh or gorbachev if there is a one-party monopoly his own party might try to stab him in the back but if you have a parliamentary system with a strong and stable opposition you can reduce the chances that hardline clique inside the ruling party whether it is the communist party or the pap reduce the chances that they have to overthrow the system in other words if somebody powerful in the pap intends to stab mr goh in the back do you think there is any pap back-bencher who has the courage to stop the hand that's holding the knife these pap back-benchers although they appear to speak up against government sometimes always follow the party line when the party whip is applied to them yes you think pap mps say amazing things yesterday dr arthur beng said that the pap needs the party whip otherwise it might get toppled by its own back-benchers yah go read the straits times if there is so much chaos don't you think we have a right to know whether there is so much chaos in the pap that they might be toppled by their own back-benchers and who will find out what is going on except your opposition who ask the embarrassing questions of the pap are you having an internal power struggle to which they only reply weak answers and as mr chiam see tong has said mr goh chok tong himself is not above making foolish statements it was reported in today's papers saying that the opposition might win all 40 contested seats and that this will mean that the pap had no mandate and that he would have to step down as prime minister in favour of someone mr goh has forgotten something let me remind him of basic parliamentary factors in the unlikely situation that mr ramasamy's justice party beats him he won't even be an mp and do you know why mr goh chok tong forgot that because he really doesn't believe that he is going to lose he really doesn't believe that the opposition might win 40 seats the reality is that we may that the pap will win many of these 40 seats what the hope is is that the opposition can win some of them this is what we are talking about the system in singapore we are lucky that we have a political system based on a tried and tested model the british western system the system that has been tested over hundreds of years in russia the old guards tried to introduce a new system based on the dominance of one single party this party controls everything from trade union to public transport and health it took them 70 years before they realise that the system did not work and by then the damage was done here in singapore we do not have 70 years one slip by the pap we might be finished unless there is an opposition to check the excesses of government  an opposition to speak up for all people whom the pap does not listen to an opposition to tell the government when and what it is doing wrong and why and finally it is necessary an opposition to stand up in front of tanks to stand up 
Singapore	 and now we'd like to cross over to the singapore conference hall for a press conference by the prime minister  well the votes are now in and in a short while our prime minister mr goh chok tong will begin a post-election press conference  yes good morning ladies and gentlemen i called this election to seek an endorsement for my leadership my style of government and my program the results showed that while the voters have given the pap the mandate to govern singapore they have not given me the clear endorsement i have hoped for in terms of popular votes the pap has 61% which is 2.2% less than the 63.2 won in 1988 i hoped for a better improvement over the last uh election results in other words i was hoping for a percentage point higher than the 63.2% that did not come about in the process we have also lost 3 good mps including 2 office-holders are ng pock too suraimy and tan guan seng we also lost a promising new candidate andy gan i am proud of them they worked hard they campaigned hard i'm sorry to have lost them in this election in a developed country the results that we had would be considered a landslide victory but we are not a developed country after the solid progress in the last three years that is the last election and having put in quite a lot of effort in terms of policies and programs for the benefit of the people in particular my style of trying to reach out to singaporeans to build a consensus i've hoped for a solid endorsement to strengthen my political position to carry out the changes i have spelt out that solid endorsement did not come i will have to study the detail results reflect over them to understand their meaning and then to decide whether and how to continue with my open consultative style of government personally i'm disappointed that i got to perhaps modify my style of government i'm reluctant to do so cos' that's my personality that's something which i believe in i still would like to pursue the style of government but obviously since i did not get a strong endorsement for this i would have to make modifications to my style besides my leadership the major issue which arose in this election was the use of gut feelings of race and religion in singapore gut feelings of race and religion in singapore jufrie mahmood workers' party candidate for eunos grc made use of communal and religious tools to win malay votes i took a strong stand against him i felt very strongly that that is a wrong way to campaign and that if you allow one candidate to do so other candidates would follow very quickly and this will lead to big trouble the workers' party and sdp decided/united in it became abundantly clear during the election campaign that the eunos results would be seen as i put it during the campaign a test case as to whether the people of singapore or in this case the people of eunos condone a communal approach to politics or reject it well the pap won in eunos but by a very small margin i find it incomprehensible that on this basic issue we should win only by a small margin it shows that many voters in eunos grc have not understood the gravity of communal politics the danger this trend holds for singapore i'm deeply concerned for the implications for the future shape of politics in a multi-racial singapore over several days we argued openly over this fundamental issue that in elections no candidate should use communal religious pulls to work on the gut feel of race and religion i cannot understand the results in eunos grc even though we won and i'm fearful of what it portends for singapore in the future but what is clear is that the strategy of mr chiam see tong has worked mr chiam see tong used a strategy that the pap was given the mandate to govern and that this was a by-election and because he succeeded in focussing voters' minds on the fact that this was a by-election the attitude of the voters changed and that attitude changed on the validity of nomination when you returned back a government he asked them to vote for the opposition and from the results you could that wherever there were plausible or wherever there were credible candidates or even possible ones the voters decided to vote for them there is now a proper opposition in parliament and mr chiam can rightly claim to be its leader he will be the leader of the opposition in parliament the ground rules have changed those who are opposed to the government can now have the official opposition to work through the pap self-imposed opposition role is now over in other words pap mps have no further need to play opposition in parliament this role will be taken over by mr chiam and his opposition members of parliament like government parliamentary parties in other commonwealth countries the pap's role will now be that of a conventional governing party in a two-party political partisan situation this is a new situation i've seen in the cam campaign that if we lose ten seats and our percentage falls below 55% that life will not be as before life cannot go on as before that was what i said during the election campaign we did not lose ten seats we did not lose 8% of the votes from the last time but in my view life cannot be as before certain things have to change now how they will change i do not know tonight but i feel that politics in singapore cannot go on as before it's a new situation now we have to face this i myself am of course personally disappointed but nevertheless it is still quite a relief that the results were what they were it could have been worse now i'll take on some questions will you want to say a few words in uh mandarin uh i think maybe say a few words in mandarin say a few words in mandarin if you want to you're good in chinese i'm not good in chinese put it in chinese uh just one minute i think i would uh ask my colleague to say a few words in mandarin  ong teng cheong spoke in mandarin  the next lap sets out what we want singapore to be in the next generation my government will translate these long-term goals into immediate programs so that singaporeans will be better off by the end of this term of parliament standards of living have risen rapidly in singapore jobs have been plentiful nearly everyone owns his own home complete with telephone and television cpf and posb savings have gone up standards of health care have risen more students are making it to secondary schools and into polytechnics and universities all this has been achieved because sound government policies have created a framework for sustained growth and enable singaporeans to progress and prosper but we are only half-way up to becoming a developed country the more difficult half remains ahead of us we can only get there as one united nation singaporeans naturally compete to do well individually and get ahead but we must also work together to succeed as a group and to strngthen the bonds among us we must encourage the more able to do their best for themselves and for singapore but the more able must also need to show concern for the others and help them to catch up we should level up to progress not level down to stagnate the government will play an essential role it will reward drive and enterprise and give each singaporean the incentive to excel it will invest heavily in educaiton and human resources so that each one can acquire the right knowledge and skill be self-reliant and earn more the government will also to build up the assets of singaporeans by upgrading and increasing the value of their hdb homes this will give every citizen a share of the wealth we have created together and strengthen his stake in singapore however while the government will subsidize investments like education and infrastructure it will not subsidize consumption expenditure to do so is to undermine the traditional virtues of thrift personal responsibility and the will to achieve and to weaken our economy the experience of other countries has proved this again and again education is the foundation of competitiveness it is not eh one of exercise but the life-long process as we acquire new knowledge and skills to keep up with new technology and adapt to new economic changes school results have steadily improved as we raise teaching standards and refine the education system demand for higher education has increased the institute of technical education will be formed this year to train not only fresh school leavers but older workers who want to upgrade their skills and their jobs a fourth polytechnic will be set up this year nus and ntu have increased their intakes and will expand further as more qualified students graduate from schools the singapore open university will admit students starting this year to give adults who missed out on a tertiary education a second chance to work for university degrees education is an investment in our people we must invest more in our most promising students while looking after the needs of the less able in schools we need to give parents a wider range of choices so that their children can receive the education best tailored to their individual needs this is the rationale for the independent schools and the edusave scheme we need to develop the independent schools into outstanding institutions to give the most promising and able students an education matching their promise admission to these schools must be based principally on merit not ability to pay no bright child from a poor home need lose his chance to study in an independent school there'll be scholarships and bursaries for him attention paid to independent schools will not be at the expense of the other schools instead the other schools will benefit from ideas tested out successfully in the independent schools by demonstrating what is possible the independent schools will help other schools to raise standards the government will widen the edusave scheme to achieve these objectives it had previously announced that every year the scheme will contribute a sum to the edusave account of each individual student in addition edusave will now fund two types of scholarships one scholarship will be for top pupils going to independent schools they will be chosen based on academic merit from among the best students in the country regardless of family background one quarter of the pupils in independent schools will receive such scholarships which will cover the school fees the second type of scholarship will be for students going to nonindependent secondary schools this scholarship can be awarded on the constitutuency or school basis to grassroots organizations and school advisory or management committees in this way good students in many schools and not just the outstanding students in independent schools will be recognised and encouraged to put in their best efforts besides awarding scholarships edusave will also make annual grants to government and government-aided secondary schools the schools will have discretion to use these grants for example to hire extra specialist staff for additional equipment like computers or for bursaries to help needy students they can be equipped more like independent schools to fund these new schemes the annual edusave contribution to individual accounts will be correspondingly reduced nearly every singaporean now owns the home he lives in the government will refurbish and upgrade the older hdb estates to approximate the quality of newer estates like pasir ris and bishan  demonstration projects will be launched later this year if they are popular with residents hdb will upgrade other neighbourhoods which want to do so over the next ten to fifteen years meanwhile we can make many improvements to existing estates to spruce up common areas and improve essential facilities for example by water-proofing bathroom floors these investments will enhance the value of hdb homes and increase the assets of singaporeans many singaporeans living in hdb flats wish to upgrade to private housing government will sell more land to private developers for condominiums and landed property developments besides homes hdb has also built many shophouses but so far it has only sold a few of them to the shopkeepers as landlord hdb has periodically needed to raise the rents of these shophouses causing difficulties to some tenants to solve these problems hdb will sell most of these shophouses to the tenants the price will be related to the market values of the properties with an appropriate discounts this will enable the shopowners to paln ahead with certainty one area of concern to singaporeans is health care as incomes rise and the population ages the demand for medical care will inevitably go up as wages of medical staff go up so will costs so will national expenditure on health care this has happened in every country sorry singapore's per capita income is only half that of the united states and japan yet the subsidised wards of government hospitals already offer better medical care than most japanese hospitals lower income singaporeans enjoy medical care than many american families who cannot afford medical insurance and have no access to good hospitals the government will ensure that all singaporeans receive bais medical care it will continue to subsidise b2 and c class wards though it will still have to revise charges for the wards from time to time there is a limit to the level of medical care which the government can guarantee every citizen the state cannot afford unlimited subsidies for high technology medicine especially treatments which are recently discovered and not yet established every dollar spent on these areas is a dollar less for other proven basic and cost-effective procedures patients who want non-standard treatments will have to pay for them at non-subsidised rates or depend on the private sector governments which ahve provided free medical care for their citizens like canada britain spain and other devloped countries more affluent than we are all face serious difficulties sweden after seventy years of state welfare plans to reform its system of governmentfunded free health care even communist china intends to start charging government employees for medical care no state can meet the insatiable demand for health care the burden of the ever increasing expenditures ultimately falls back on the people we must learn from these painful experiences of other countries our medical care system must create maximum incentive for responsibility and minimum temptation to waste the individual has a personal responsibility to keep fit stay healthy minimise the need for medical treatment and save for his own medical expenses the first report from the review committee on national health policies emphasised preventive medicine and healthy living the government has accepted this report and will launch an annual national campaign for healthy lifestyles this year we have restructured government hospitals to provide medical care more efficiently and economically the trend is for the private sector to play a bigger role in providing health care and competing against government hospitals as it haas done in obstetrics more than half the babies in singapore are born in private hospitals singaproeans who have medisave have generally been able to meet their medical expenses especially if they also have medishield but the self-employed are not covered by medisave the government will extend medisave to as many self-employed workers as possible in the long-term the medisave contirbution rate of six percent will be insufficient the government will raise medisave contribution rates progressively especially for older singaporeans who have already got their homes the government will set up a new endowment fund called medifund to complement medisave income from the endowment will be used to help poorer singaporeans whose medisave accounts are insufficient to meet their medical expenses and who need help as a last resort medifund will be an extension of the existing scheme of fee waivers for c and b2 class wards this will provide a safety net for singaporeans help from medifund will not be an entitlement each application to medifund will be assesssed individually by a committee involving community leaders to decide how much help is needed inkeeping with the principle of personal responsibility medifund will give priority to helping those who have consistently contributed to their own medisave accounts this will be an additional incentive for self-employed singaporeans to contribute to medisave for older singaporeans who retired before medisave was fully introduced medifund will be more flexible the changes in singapore society had been rapid sometimes people feel disorientated and have to struggle to keep up but the pace of change is not dictated by singapore alone the entire asia-pacific region is undergoing dramatic change other countries like south korea taiwan malaysia and thailand are advancing even more rapidly than singapore and catching up on us if we choose a more relaxed pace we must be prepared to be overtaken and left behind to stay ahead we must constantly restructure and upgrade sustaining growth depends on pursuing efficient market-oriented economic policies people sometimes these policies for paying inadequate attention to social and human factors but these are the very policies which have created the prosperity we enjoy today the communist countries pursued the opposite policies ignoring market forces and eliminating income differences by government order they created poverty and despair many have collapsed the government cannot hold back change but it will help singaporeans to adapt to change it cannot protect local businesses against foreign competition but it will help them to restructure and compete it cannot preserve redundant jobs where technology or market demand has changed but it can help affected workers to retrain and find new jobs while we constantly upgrade and adjust the changing world conditions we must not unthinkingly cut ourselves off from our cultural roots government policies must always enjoy the broad support of the major social groups including the less vocal non-english speaking part of our society now that the economy is more developed growth is becoming more difficult despite our best efforts the economy will slow down where previously eight percent growth was normal in the next phase five to seven percent growth will be very good while we work harder to upgrade and become more productive so must also moderate our expectations of wage increase in recent years wages have been increased by as much as ten percent per year but this cannot be sustained over the long-term the labour market is still tight but eventually wages will have to slow down to match productivity and economic growth otherwise we'll be we will be chasing our own tails and higher wages will cause higher inflation without improving standards of living implementing policies to carry singapore forward in the next lap depends on an efficient and professional civil service which can attract and challenge some of the most able singaporeans to contribute their best to singapore the present civil service arrangements for recruiting promoting and managing personnel centred on the public service commission and the public service division were inherited from the colonial government the arrangements are over-centralised and too rigid to cope with a rapidly changing labour market they give more weight to internal civil service relativities between unrelated vocations than to fault the market judges the jobs to be worth despite periodic salary revisions the civil service is unable to recruit all the talent it needs and pay them market rates in britain the civil service commission has delegated most of its authority to ministries and departments and retain responsibility for only fifteen percent of recruitment malaysia which inherited similar arrangements as ours has amended its constitution to delegate civil service promotions to ministries the malaysian psc is only responsible for recruitment we must make fundamental changes to the management of the singapore civil service and free up its personnel administration the public sector must become a more responsive and competitive employer without compromising the integrity and impartiality of the civil service and the statutory boards we are entering a new phase of singapore's devlopment we have successfully overcome the basic challenges of the firts twenty-five years of independence schools housing security jobs and basic health care we have built up substantial reserves and created an elected presidency with powers to give some protection to these reserves now we face new challenges how to strengthen national consensus despite the absence of visible danger how to remind singaporeans that the basics have not changed however secure our prosperity may appear how to remain agile and keen even though we are no longer lean and hungry how to be a meritocratic but not an individualistic society how to maintain the pace of upgrading so that singapore will become a developed country and all will be better-off by the end of the century the new generation of singaporeans must find fresh answers to these challenges amidst tumultuous international changes 
Singapore	the year 1990 will long be remembered as a special year by singaporeans the university and of course by you the new graduates for singaporeans it marks the silver jubilee of our nationhood and 25 years of successful unrelenting efforts at nation-building for the university it signifies 10 years of extraordinary growth and development following the merger of our two predecessor universities and for the new graduates it means the crowning glory of 16 years of formal education and launching into the exciting world of work together they call for jubilant celebrations and all three are actually related a prosperous singapore has provided the necessary support for the university galvanised by the merger to offer the quality education which amply prepares graduates to take on the challenges that lie ahead of them and the success of the well-prepared graduates in turn helps to sustain and enhance the prosperity of singapore itself thus completing the circle of happy relationships the success of graduates in the world of work does depend on opportunities which are determined to a large extent by the state of the country's economy as our national economy has remained sound opportunities for work are plentiful for our graduates i expect the great majority if not all of you are already gainfully employed as engineers you are particularly in great demand because industry has become increasingly high-tech and knowledge-intensive as it develops and industrial r&d is fast gathering momentum in fact market forces have conspired to place engineers in the ranks of top earners among the new graduates with the recent upturn in the construction industry there is now even talk of shortage of good civil engineers in the profession these buoyant features of our economy however should not blind us to our vulnerability to rapid unexpected changes in the world at large as recent events in the middle east have again shown graduates while rightly committed to training for their chosen careers should always remain alert and mentally nimble and be prepared to adapt to re-learn and to meet unfamiliar challenges for the latter i am confident your university education will stand you in good stead you have been equipped with an inquiring analytical mind capable of innovation and independent learning and you should be ready to make your mark in society under any condition in the first 10 years of its existence nus itself has successfully met new demands and thrived on fresh challenges to support the targeted ambitious socio-economic growth of our nation the university has had to produce quality manpower in sufficient numbers over this period undergraduate enrolment in the university has increased by some 80 per cent from 8,634 to 15,298 to maintain and enhance the quality of education teaching staff has more than doubled from 602 to 1,389 and various schemes and measures such as student feedback on teaching and courses consultation with faculty advisory committees seminars and workshops on teaching skills adjunct teaching appointments from outside the university compulsory practical training and computer-based learning have been introduced creativity and innovation have been nurtured through challenging projects and open-ended experiments in the laboratories while the recently introduced optional enrichment courses broaden the intellectual horizon the favourable outcome is reflected in the high regard with which nus degrees are held by professional bodies internationally by employers and by other universities the increasing sophistication and the high technology thrust of our economic development have brought about a growing demand for more specialised manpower this has been matched by a four-fold increase in the postgraduate enrolment in the university from 536 to 2,241 over the last 10 years of the 671 postgraduates pursuing masters' or phds by research about three quarters are in engineering medicine and science indicating that a thriving research culture particularly in these disciplines has developed in the context of the increasing importance of r & d to our economy the establishment of iss in 1981 imcb in 1987 and the several research centres for other subjects have markedly reinforced the research culture staff research output has increased more than three-fold with significantly higher percentage of publications appearing in journals included in the science and social sciences citation indices research efforts have focused on certain chosen niches and important break-throughs have been achieved backed by its large body of experts and its comprehensive and up-to-date facilities and equipment the university has in the last 10 years rapidly stepped up collaboration with industry and outside organisations in r & d and commercialisation of research findings as well as in providing consultation services transferring technology and organising specialist up-date courses in addition the faculties have held frequent lectures and seminars on practical topics and issues to which interested parties outside the university were invited these seminars often multidisciplinary in nature and involving several faculties have proved very popular and fruitful the last 10 years have also seen a healthy growth in another aspect of university life regular lunch-time performances of music dance and drama which commenced in 1985 art exhibitions the expanded activities of the centre for musical activities and the recently opened lee kong chian art museum have all contributed to bringing about a culturally vibrant campus another important development in the last decade has been the strengthening of bonds between the alumni and their alma mater enhanced by the establishment of alumni affairs office in 1988 and its programmes of activities the university has grown very fast and clearly made significant gains in the first 10 years as nus it is natural at this juncture to pause and ponder how the university should develop in the next 10 years the mission remains one of supporting the nation's social and economic development by producing the needed high-level manpower and by promoting research and innovation it sets the intellectual tone for the society and serves as a rich resource of information and expertise for nation building there is the need to respond to the changing demands as singapore make its way towards the status of a developed nation undergraduate course structure and content will continue to be reviewed regularly new subjects and courses will be introduced to meet emerging needs for example the science faculty which has introduced two subjects this year namely cell and molecular biology and development & systems biology will offer materials science and computational science next year the faculty of arts & social sciences will introduce mass communication and european studies next year greater flexibility will be incorporated in the degree and course structures such that the best and brightest will be able to realise their full potential growth will take place mainly in postgraduate enrolment to meet the expected demand for more specialist manpower in the economy new postgraduate programmes will be introduced when needed every effort will be made to increase the enrolment of postgraduate research students from whom our nation's r & d manpower are derived the availability of well-trained r & d manpower in sufficient numbers is as we know critical to our further economic growth the postgraduate school of engineering recently established to spearhead the expansion of postgraduate programmes in engineering aims to double the postgraduate research student enrolment to 500 by 1995 comparable rates of expansion in the enrolment of research students are expected in other disciplines particularly in science and medicine there will be a corresponding increase in research activities on the campus this will be reflected in the establishment of the clinical research centre the institute of microelectronics and the centre for advanced legal studies within the next two years collaboration with industry will be further intensified especially in joint r & d programmes and in the economic exploitation of the fruits of research information technology and biotechnology have been identified as two important pillars of our economic development the university will continue to play a key role in these areas the bioprocessing technology unit recently established in the department of chemical engineering converts laboratory results in molecular biology into commercial entities the national supercomputing resource centre soon to be set up by the university combined with the campus-wide state-of-the-art computing network which is optical-fibre based and the largest in the asia pacific region will provide the optimal environment for r&d in information technology implicit in the above plans and measures is the objective of making nus a world class university building on the sound foundation already laid down this will complement singapore's march towards being a developed nation the existing campus facilities planned and constructed mainly in the 70's will be upgraded and extended so that they are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and bearing a distinctive character that reflects the history and heritage of the university a concert hall theatre of international standard will be built incorporating a museum and a visual art centre to provide a centre for performing and fine art on the campus this will further enrich the cultural life of the university and ensure a more rounded education three additional halls of residence will also be built to provide for at least one year of on-campus residence for every undergraduate a master planner for this major campus-wide project has been appointed and a concept plan is expected to be ready by the end of the year the physical facilities should ultimately be of a standard befitting a world-class university for the graduates there is much about your alma mater that you can be proud of and there is more to expect in the offing a proud alumnus is one who feels he has a stake in the future of his alma mater and the best universities in the world for example the ivy league universities are those which receive strong regular support from their proud alumni as the saying goes 'a university is only as great as its alumni want it to be' nus is no exception as it moves up the scale of excellence the need for support from its alumni will become increasingly obvious we have therefore got to start to work on providing this support setting up an endowment fund as suggested by our minister dr tony tan would be a good start this is being seriously looked into the alumni affairs office will liaise with you on this matter in due course meanwhile your ideas and suggestions are most welcome i am confident that the alumni of which you are already a part are now ready to do their utmost for their alma mater their loyalty and attachment to the university coupled with their sense of gratitude will move them to help make their alma mater even better than what they themselves had known it to be in conclusion i would like to take this opportunity to wish all of you the very best in the pursuit of your careers ahead of you you may have left the campus but you are still very much a part of the greater nus community do visit the campus and take part in the wide variety of alumni activities if only to remind yourselves that learning should not cease with graduation from the university learning is a life-long adventure to be courted and relished always to those who are receiving their first degree scrolls this year the job market continues to beckon with many exciting opportunities the demand for graduates in the economy remains strong and new graduates of the university are known to be keen capable and hardworking they will have the opportunity to put to good use what they have learnt in the university it will soon become apparent to the new graduates that except for colleagues from the professional faculties working in professional firms or institutions not all the knowledge and skills learnt as undergraduates will find direct application in the workplace one skill however stands out without exception it makes all the difference to the effectiveness of the new graduate at his new job this is the skill of independent learning the ability to acquire on one's own new knowledge and skills needed for one's job 
Singapore	 address by mr lim soon hock, managing director, asia compaq computer asia pte ltd  mr pro-chancellor graduates ladies and gentlemen it is a privilege for me to address you all today congratulations graduates for many of you today marks the end of your academic careers and i'm sure you have looked forward to this moment with great expectations the degrees you collect today are recognition of what you have accomplished through hard work perseverance and dedication they will prove to the world that you are all trained engineers they look backward at the life you have lead until today and praise you for your accomplishments but they represent something far more important something which looks ahead they prove that you have learned how to learn that in the final analysis is education's greatest gift because in the world outside the comfortable halls of academia it is not what you know but rather what you are able to learn which will make all the difference what lies ahead of you all today is a world which is changing faster and more profoundly than it ever has before it is a world that just a few short years ago was unimaginable who could have imagined a united germany the fall of communism in country after country in eastern europe manned space travel being only page three news or the soviet union looking to the united states and other countries for the financing necessary to move toward a free market economy so if the degrees you receive today are tickets for your journey through this daunting and unpredictable landscape what advice can i lend to help you on your way i think i would start with a strange request i would ask each and every one of you to be unreasonable this must sound strange after you have spent so much time in these halls learning the value of reason honing your skills to become reasoned thinkers and after countless requests from parents and teachers to just be reasonable let me explain george bernard shaw once said the reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man if shaw had been writing today he undoubtedly would have said that progress depends on the unreasonable man or woman and that raises another point about changes in the world around us changing the world is no longer the province of just men what was once patronisingly called the fairer sex has proven that it is often also the smarter and more capable one the proverbial battle of the sexes has broken free of the confines of moonlit nights and candle-lit dinners now it is as frequently waged in boardrooms or from political platforms so why do i ask you men and women to be unreasonable what do i mean by being unreasonable if i place my request in its historical context perhaps it will become clearer the 19th century saw the rapid advancement of civilization first start on a modern scale of pace reach and impact it brought the industrial revolution great strides forward in medicine and the ascendance of science as man's principal tool for unlocking the mysteries of the world around him it was called the age of reason in the 20th century the world first took full advantage of all of these new found tools of reason the pace of change took a huge stride forward two world wars and the terrifying technology of nuclear weapons created a bi-polar political structure which has brought relative stability to world politics for the past 50 years man began the exploration of space information became instantly accessible around the globe when japan declared war against the united states it took two and a half days for the declaration to be formally presented i am told that george bush informed mikhail gorbachev of the us invasion of kuwait within twenty minutes and coverage of that war was seen live on televisions in london living rooms and sarawak longhouses simultaneously we truly have become the products of the information age this overwhelming abundance of and access to information will have a major impact in further shaping the century to come it will be a century which one london business school professor has dubbed the age of unreason this is the century that you inherit the century you will help shape what will it be like i'm sure my imagination could not do it credit but some parts of it are clear technology will bring changes at a faster and faster rate traditional structures and processes of business and society will be replaced over and over again within a decade it has been predicted that eighty percent of all jobs in industrialised nations will call for mental rather than manual skills that seems extremely encouraging for a group of new degree holders but what mental skills will be needed hopefully many of those same skills which you have worked so hard at learning during your years here at university education will have given you the tools you need to confront the change which lies ahead as graduates you represent the top 18% of all students in singapore but your specific training as engineers is only one part of what you will need primary among the broader skills your education has given you will be the ability to adapt and learn to master and in fact help shape change that statement brings me back to my original premise about being unreasonable in this context then being unreasonable means not being content to accept change but rather taking the initiative to shape it as you enter the working world you become a part of the process of change more importantly the significance of the part you play is entirely up to you einstein had three rules of work one out of clutter find simplicity two from discord make harmony three in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity these are simple rules from a very complex man but it is important to note that these rules place the burden squarely on the shoulders of the individual it will be your job to find simplicity and make harmony to rise above difficulty and take advantage of every opportunity you must find it unreasonable to resist change to do it as it has always been done you must find it unreasonable to approach challenges with conventional thought to play conventional roles to be content with the status quo many of you, statistics show that as many as 20 to 30 per cent of you may find your careers leading you away from your training in engineering on the other hand many of you will prosper in your chosen field for years to come either course is fine as long as you refuse to either hide behind complacency or run from adversity the changing future has equal need for the strength and discipline of focused experts and the creativity and daring of entrepreneurs the key is to continue to adapt the world around you on whatever path you choose in the past that world has been adapted by two forces more than any others technology and economics each feeding on and spurring growth in the other the individuals who have made a difference have always understood this link and exploited it to the fullest many of them started as engineers it was reasonable to think that the telegraph transported information quickly and effectively but not to alexander graham bell it was reasonable to be content with gas lighting but not to thomas edison it was reasonable to think that conventional manufacturing techniques produced adequate amounts of goods but not to henry ford the list is a familiar one individuals with vision and an unreasonable desire to reinvent the world around themselves so how do these well-known examples have relevance in today's singapore each of these unreasonable men changed their world they combined technical engineering skills with vision to propel their societies forward and their ideas helped spur enormous economic growth in their countries if we look at today's leading nations each built economic might on the back of technological excellence the united states germany japan engineering and engineers with vision led the way today's singapore provides unlimited opportunities for tomorrow's edisons fords and bells singapore has worked hard to provide an environment which is not limited by its small geographic boundaries our country has succeeded in creating the landscape of a technopolis with worldwide relevance foresight perseverance and hard work have given singapore its much envied infrastructure the hard structures facilities and technologies needed to provide for growth in the 20th century today's great global companies have recognised singapore's importance by establishing themselves here you must match and indeed take advantage of their global vision the opportunities for each and every one of you to expand both your visionary and physical horizons are better than they have ever been before it is not unreasonable to think that any of you could find work in one of the world's largest corporations it is not unreasonable to think that the work you do for such a company can effect and change the world for the better it is not unreasonable to expect you to build the soft infrastructure by which i mean the creativity innovativeness technical expertise r&d know how financial acumen marketing prowess and managerial talents which will be needed to continually attract investments into singapore as we grow into the 21st century it may seem unreasonable however for me to make my next request currently only four singapore companies are counted among the worlds top 1,000 i put it to you that you can play a role in seeing that number greatly increase during your lifetimes some among you may become entrepreneurs it will take courage and perseverance to see your personal visions grow and prosper but you must always remember that growth and prosperity are only limited by your ideas by successfully combining your technical training with the business skills which you will develop and hone in your professional careers you can add to that list with a global vision and the opportunities which singapore's technopolis holds out to you you can become masters of change but does this mean you must master change alone does it mean you must discard everything from the past thankfully it does not to face change and become its master you will need firm foundations and anchors your parents the families you yourselves will start your school your cultural traditions and the society around you all will serve as your reservoirs of strength and continuity in the changing world but as much as these represent strength and support you will now begin to see the responsibility they bring with them as well throughout your education you have been able to concentrate on yourselves your test scores your performance and your growing abilities have been your first priority but today represents as much as anything the beginning of a shift in that scale of priorities now begins the process of looking outward of giving back to those people institutions and structures which have given so much to you as you adapt the future never discard the past instead build on it keep up your ties with the university i would urge you all to become active members of the engineering alumni today you have been transformed from your status as students to membership in a much broader fellowship that of graduates as members of this fellowship you have new resources on which to draw and new responsibilities to fulfil if recent statements by our government are anything to go by the alumni will play a greater role in the future development of our university that role is not merely limited to financial support you can contribute by sharing your expertise and the new areas of specialisation which you will find in the professional world with the undergraduates graduates and fellow alumni this type of shared fellowship can foster professionalism create business opportunities and most importantly help the university to become a richer and more lively environment for learning  now you get to change the world it is your job to give shape and meaning to the age of unreason do it with a sense of expectation and possibility do it with enthusiasm do it for both yourself and others and i am confident you will do it well i think, all in all, that is a pretty reasonable request
