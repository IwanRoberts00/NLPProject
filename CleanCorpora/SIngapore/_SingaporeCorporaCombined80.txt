have have you all watched sleepless in seattle yah i caught it last week i think what do you think of it uhm it is too fairy tale yah it is a bit of realistic too fairy tale you suspend believe for about uh one hour forty-five minutes and then yah and you know at the end of the day meg ryan is gonna be with tom hanks she did ah you haven't watched at all no i haven't because no no no be because the thing is my guy friends went there and then they said i didn't miss a thing yah actually you won't miss a thing lah it was more of a lady's show would you consider that a lady's show it came out in newspaper right that was a woman woman show or uh man show and they talking about difference like men like action and women like romance women like action men like action ah men like action play back this one ah okay did you hear women or men women right women i said men no i said that i heard women men like okay okay we all go back to the beginning and listen to what i say thank god it's taped right written prove thank you no no recorded proof anyway yah i caught it it is nice lah it is ta lah lah you know yah you wait for that magic thing to happen and so was there star dust and all you know then after that that soft focus effect no there was no soft focus but there was star dust but i don't really think it was that romantic it's like they are raving about it being a girl's show i think i prefer things like some kind of wonderful or pretty women the message was better aye no pretty women was quite okay right i like freely willy oh you watched it already don't think of it slowly lah i haven't i haven't watched it either fish word  freely willy listen aye i went to watch uhm i wanted to watch a show yesterday i just wanted to watch oh the trailers ah no i just wanted to watch a show yesterday so i i went down to town and uhm i was going to watch wedding banquet but a friend wanted to watch it with me so i decided okay i'll go and watch free willy instead when i got there at one twenty the tickets were sold out for what time one twen one one fifteen show no no because the the the kids are out just by five minutes off yah but the it is sold out and normally and all the time when i go watch these afternoon shows which i always have a whole theatre to myself and about five other people scattered no because it's holidays now the only people that are missing are the o levels and the a level people why are holidays word  i i like all these one o'clock shows where it is empty that time that time i watched wedding banquet yah so yesterday i went yah you went to watch wedding banquet yesterday no not yesterday oh teacher's day wow so the students no on teacher's day the students can't go in it is r a yah yah so the students were out apparently it wasn't a holiday i didn't know it was r a but but then a lot of people with ties were there quite nice quite nice i went to watch yesterday i missed five minutes of it because i was late it was a one-twenty show wedding banquet wedding banquet first five minutes i know nothing happen i i asked a friend of mine nothing much lah i came in at the point where he was promising i think he's i went in late also i think i went in at the point where was promising simon is it his name uhm simon yah that i will bring you to paris had to make up for it as your birthday present or someone forgot someone's birthday did you watch that show uhm the first five minutes was nothing he was at the gym oh yes yes okay that means i didn't missing anything did you like the show i i thought the concept was good yah one of the few nice concepts but it was the first thing that i i saw men being intimate and they look so natural you should see savage nights then oh okay no i didn't want to see that that one is best it is a french show ah hah men are actually natural kissing no but they the thing is first came across as not usually you would you know you you would cringe and like like yah but this one is like they are meant to be together in fact word  but i didn't see much bonding between the two guys actually because they cut a lot of parts everytime they are about to say something or something they snip they or they do something every time they are like close to hugging on the bed they snip they snip oh that is why i didn't see any relationship between those two you know so i i was wondering how come it was so difficult for that chinese guy what's his name simon ah simon is that no no simon is the ang moh caucasian right yah what's the chinese guy's name wei tung oh yes yah yes so so i didn't see what what he was missing by marrying the girl it's that is why in this kind of show it was the censorship was too heavy actually because you don't see the relationship between the two yah lor then so heartbroken but i think the the simon was very uhm very generous i mean if you're in a relationship and when you get smart and word  sex here i mean gender i mean gender and then uh somebody else comes he was like very generous to okay come join our family lah that kind he has to show oh very and the father oh my goodness he understood the whole thing yap he knew everything but he looked so blur from the start he didn't look as though he knew anything no i felt no as soon as went to the back yard and he saw the two chairs i felt that he was already you know they had a lingering shot shot on the two chairs and the back yard oh didn't notice it oh i didn't see that okay lah no they cut ten minutes of this this scene you see whereby simon and wei tung were on the bed and the father came in he saw it he actually saw them no wonder he knew in action and he closed the door oh in action ah how did you get all this oh because my friend watched the seen uncensored uncensored version where i don't know i don't know they were just telling us actually ah they would they show this somewhere else where not in malaysia not in malaysia not in malaysia i guess states lah in thailand they would yah probably wondering how i know i didn't see word  where was the last time you were at thailand last year i am going again this year you are going again this year yah in december what are your plans for the holidays nothing because at the end of this week i am going for ipoh going for what for a congress congress yah which one and then i'll be back the lasalle congress say louder you know okay then after that i'll i will be back on the twenty-eighth and then after that that music ministry presentation at world trade centre you are not going to be a priest or anything right priest not yet i i don't know i i don't know think but whatever it is i think you make a good father yah a good father what kind of father is that biological or yah or a good priest whichever yah that that is what somebody told me too so because kelly always relate well to students oh really kelly i want to catch the firm tonight maybe which one which firm which one the firm oh the firm i heard the film yes i heard the film too yah the firm the firm aye it's a long show you know really another one of those like uh what john denver end at two quite boring the book is better eleven o'clock show then the next show is at two-thirty oh the next one the next one is oh the next one is at five or six or something okay got to go back and get my friend now but even in the line of fire was quite long right i didn't watch that i didn't feel like the show yah too long it it ended late it ended real late i watched fugitive oh which one fugitive 1 or 2 fugitive 1 lah that is nice harrison ford then then someone someone else in it who is the other guy jamie lee jones oh yah yes he was the best that that cool guy oh oh yah real cool someone i was right it it's it is my job he was really cool he stole the limelight you know even though he's not of of i don't know but quite heartless uh you you could no you could you could hate the guy but you eventually ended up liking him at the end of the show yah ah because he actually basically was just doing his job yah i think he was yah and he was a thinking man too he didn't just take everything he did ask questions like what do you want to be a hero when he was running away you know the hospital yah but after that he just pushed that aside and carry on with his job right suppose to lah yah true but it was just i run away you come after me i run you come so so i i didn't find that show that interesting compared did you watch in in line of fire yah you find that interesting yah i found that oh did you watch that show clint clint eastwood yah nope haven't watched it yet i i i think it will be more interesting than this because usually when we say when we mention crink clint crink clint eastwood you would think of someone who's really tough right actually i just think of someone real old no yah so so so yah so in this show you will see him old and frightened oh i don't want a woman in a man which i i didn't expect him to be able to portray i remember him in the make my day make my day yah yah that that is the image we have right but in this show he he came across as someone who's afraid of death i mean just frighten lah more human my favourite actor is sean connery oh oh is it why sean connery oh who isn't who doesn't like you i didn't like him you know before when he was younger as he got older only then i started to like him now any show he is in in then i will then my mother was like asking me how come you like bearded bald men balding already right isn't he balding but he looks good i think his prime show where he started yah like he started maturing was name of the rose i think that was that was that was when i was converted
