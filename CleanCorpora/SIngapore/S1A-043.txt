""
you can get to know people  word 
""
""
 word  it is gonna be just great from the
house
""
""
 word  in a good sense haadyai is the place
where you go for massages
""
""

""
but of course you know what i mean orlando
""
""

""
""

""
i think this is a good programme
""
what do you think
""
i am sure we will get to know some people
""
definitely
""
""
hope there will be a lot people
""
thirty over people in our whole trip lah
""
if there is just three of us then uh
""
""
when  word 
""
""
there will be a group
""
""
in a group they they will be more careful
""
we come from agencies  word 
""
""
three three
""
""
wait three guys another three guys come in how
""
triple sharing ah
""
ya room three ah
""
cancel and go bangkok
""
""
never mind it is only four days
""
""
the lady told me that the chances of getting the confirmed
flight back to singapore is are good whenever they are
""
but if
""
""
no uncertainty also ah ya
""
she may be worried
""
""
that is the problem
""
i don't know how her definite  word  come back
gone
""
""
it is quite true some people use this to make money using this
kind of thing
""
and then we won't go around to make again
""
creatures of the night thing
""
""
if that falls through then we have nowhere to go
""
that means we have to opt for the three day one
""
""
no no
""
why don't actually we can actually call them and ask them
""
if they pull through we can make other arrangement
""
but they can't just keep on offer when you promise us that
 word  right
""
now they keep us on hold then we can't go to other agency
""
it is not fair you see
""
""
so it is not that
""
if that is the case then we opt for a three day two night by then
hundred dollar cheaper
""
two nine nine
""
""
oh they don't have that
""
""
i think they don't have
""
""
oh
""
""
wait wait i ask
""
""
oh
""
""
oh room service  word 
""
you didn't tell me about  word 
""
""
 word  fuss over this issue whereby they
delaying delaying us
""
""
his cheapness is revealing
""
""
what
""
he is getting cheaper by the hour
""
""
 word  problem is just like we just be
going just one day
""
""
well if we find a seat early the morning
""
we come up come back late at night
""
""
i ask ronald when i was  word  three day
four night lah  word 
""
""
exactly if he wants to laze around lah
""
i think he needs that roughly
""
""
if you want to laze around three days is more than sufficient
""
two full days of time one full day of night
""
""
of course the night life there is quite great
""
a lot of basically you can see the international people
""
""
they have disco over there
""
""
ya it is at the hard the rock hard not hard rock cafe
""
if you know what i mean
""
""
they have those pasar malam there right just like in pattaya
""
""
right
""
""
it is all lined up along the road along the street
""
""
then it is very much like pattaya i suppose
""
""
ya but more cosmopolitan in the sense that you have a
 word 
""
""
what do you mean by cosmopolitan
""
""
well different type of different type of people there
different types of people mainly caucasians
""
""
 word 
""
""
how much do you think we have we need to change
""
""
up to you if you are impulsive spender then you will have to
change more
""
but i think hundred sing is sufficient
""
""
for four days
""
""
you have to bear in mind we have to pay airport tax over that
side
""
it is two hundred baht if i am not mistaken unless they have revise
the charges
""
any case oh ya if you want to go for the cabaret show 
word  it is two hundred and fifty baht
""
so it is about uh twenty twenty dollars uh eighteen twenty dollars
""
the ratio baht to sing one to fifteen
""
one sing to fifteen baht
""
last time i went ten years ago was one to eight
""
now it is one to fifteen
""
so good
""
""
one to fifteen uh
""
""
one singapore is equivalent to fifteen baht
""
""
so one baht is about uh seven
""
""
one divide by fifteen
""
""
one hundred baht seven seven sing dollars
""
""
one hundred baht will be seven sing dollars
""
""
so when was the last time you went
""
""
early april may
""
""
when
""
""
my time was around the same ya
""
""
one fifteen also
""
""
no ya one fifteen
""
i went in nineteen eighty eight
""
""
one fifteen ah
""
""
ya
""
""
 word 
""
""
quite close to taiwanese tai pi
""
""
ninety dollars
""
""
i think also
""
i don't think i will be spending much five hundred four hundred
and fifty baht  word 
""
""
how much do you intend to bring
""
""
hundred
""
""
but why you bring one hundred
""
""
i am cheap man
""
cheaper better
""
cannot  word 
""
""
i am not going to buy anything much there because got there
enough already
""
""
t shirts all these are in what
""
""
i  word  to t shirts and then with the
""
""
 word 
""
""
of course you can go the top take a tut tut or you want to
hire a train
""
or you can spend the whole day at town or just
""
""
do they have durians there
""
""
oh yes
""
i don't know whether the season is on too
""
""
cashews nuts i heard
""
""
yeah lay boon view
""
we are passing by a cashew nut factory
""
hopefully that is the itinerary by our agency
""
we have not visited our agency at all you know
""
don't know what is going on
""
so call blind lead blind
""
""
how do you how do you come across this
""
""
pardon
""
""
how did you get to know about this
""
""
your friendly newspaper man
""
""
oh
""
""
newspaper
""
only two or three agencies having this promotion four days three
night right
""
but of course it is the accommodation that is the diff different
""
four star and you know five
""
""
miles ahead programme
""
""
miles ahead programme
""
what is it about
""
""
every hundred dollars you charge to your your card uhvisa
card you will be given one travel point
""
so all you need is to just clear this travel point
""
the least is seven travel points
""
that gives you an whole list of discount you know
""
uh the one that i am very interested is the one at do you
pronounce as bifort or what
""
""
sentosa bifort hotel
""
""
so beaufort hotel is it
""
""
ya for me seventy odd dollars hundred
""
can't remember the actual but it was more than seventy per cent
discount
""
""
ah ha
""
""
if you were to go the market you are paying something like
three hundred plus
""
but with thirty points first thing you pay hundred and seven
seventy odd
""
""
so it is similar to the frequent fly programme on the airline
""
""
uh
""
""
but i thought you can exchange it for an air ticket
""
""
but in the hotel i will make it  word 
""
""
fifty per cent
""
""
fifty per cent
""
""
according to him is
""
""
seven
""
""
seventy per cent you know
""
it is a suite ah
""
""
ah a suite
""
""
good
""
""
and the just look at they are going to advertise very
aggressively because this is this is a very good programme i think personally
""
you can also get the one of free return ticket to klat seventy
seventy nine dollar or so at qantas airline with seven dollars pointers in it
""
only for six months this programme
""
that is within this six months you must charge lah but you can
redeem the gift travel till till nineteen ninety four
""
