okay okay i think we'll start unconsciously okay what i'm trying to say is that do you know that ha do you know i've got this scba thing you know this this is to inform ya saying about this uhm scba on june you're applying for it uh you're applying for it i've already got it and guess what's the date june the sixteen my birthday what luck! just nice lor they can celebrate your birthday there what please lah i mean isn't it i can't even celebrate my birthday properly you know in this case  interruption from a lady colleague  no i didn't i didn't i didn't switch it on no i didn't switch it off i've not been touching it for a long time okay ya and do you know there's a eight it's they give you eight minutes to present my slides i thought yours is a poster it's not slide presentation you still must do isn't it right ya ya ya i think so that means yours will be a a talk lah oh that's why i say i'm so anxious eight minutes you know right i thought it's a i thought it's submitting a poster you know 'a' never mind what that time i when i do my final year uh ya ya ya ya presentation it's also my birthday you know and then just give lah you know what to do uhm lt 25 you know i see big lt you know whoa this one is this' a very big one uh about six hundred people you know no no no no that's at lt 27 this is about three hundred four hundred you know where's lt 27 uhm uhm uhm lt 25 is a medium word so that's a great experience for you huh great experience for you what great experience i don't want it before you start you can announce what ladies and gentlemen today is my birthday today is my birthday can you please observe five minutes' silence i'm frightened please don't ask me too tough questions ya but it's quite bad you know don't you think so see how surprised i thought it's just a poster so you don't have to make poster lah for your case but i have to make slides uh ya look that means slide presentation sor i've to make slides but 'a' you got some experience or not you got some experience or not making slides 'a' that time you have already what those slides that you have ya but they're totally different this time you have to make slides for for gels stuff like that with the results and so on i think there's a lot of work involved uh ya but can i make it less than eight minutes uh but even now i say down here at eight minutes i think seven six minutes should be quite alright lah five minutes five minutes maybe too short you know five minutes is only about sixty percent of the time only if seven eight minutes i think should be alright uh no i think you definitely got more things to talk about isn't it i don't want to talk too much because i've told you i've got  word in august you got slides and so on you've got another one in august i've got another one in august so i don't want i don't want to talk too much because  word  i thought that time you submitted a poster session so you just put posters and then just stand around you know the thing is i think they are the ones who decide oh they decide so that is most ya lah good lah maybe they find that it's very interesting isn't please lah i am not it's probably very new so they are quite eager to find out more i think it's because of alan potter what do you think is he in the committee what do you think uh it's im it's organized by imcb ya provided he's sitting in the committee uh no he's not i don't think so then i don't think so i ask i'll ask this who uh keng chong uh first can we change ask him to change to posters seriously change it to poster uh ya what about that ya maybe you can try you can try is it you can try uh i all along i assume it's a poster you know ya i thought it's a poster too that's what you said isn't it it's outside that lt down there the canteen there ya ya ya ya and then just put your poster there and then just stand around lah ya ya ya ya ya word  and then ah ah ya i'll ask keng chong about it uh how's that uhm oh another thing how about keng chong did he receive this already he receive i don't know i'm going to ask him then oh maybe his is a a poster or so i can swop with him you mean you can swop with him uh or if his is a talk then too bad lah you know i think it maybe quite difficult you know because they already allocated the time everything for you already so it's quite difficult for you to withdraw like that why aiyah stupid me lah then but the good thing is a talk you just go there and then finish up the whole thing eight minutes you see because poster i think you have to stand there for the whole day and so on right you never know whether come on a talk i would have known word  i word  i'll stutter all the way well imagine kenneth mark down there can already what please he won't be back that's why i hope he'll back before then no give you moral support uh but then i don't think so really what do you think whoa dr helen chai alright man what do you really think please i didn't see this uh uhm you just like to slime me right who is this person uh joseph lee uh the one who who send this is actually this guy i think it's a china man you know singapore word  oh uh uh 'a' don't be surprised you know one of my uhm relative brother-in-law actually uh huh somebody wrote from him uh ya ya  word from uh london to singapore you know uh huh it actually en route to india before i come back to singapore really really no kid they actually got a chop 'india' down there you know no i don't believe you zhen de zhen de in mandarin) it's quite long ago lah how come last time he went there to study for his masters you see uh huh then he got some friends there then when they wrote back singapore actually went to india you know before he get he got to receive the letter but i can see uh from this person this person is a never mind i'll ask keng chong about it anyway oh good lah interesting what good experience 'a' ask you something uh but the thing is then you have to do duplicate uhm more work uh because if this is a slide you have to do slides huh and then over in us word would be a poster then you have to do another poster ya that's why because if this' poster then you just do one for both uh who says so cannot you know is it change a bit lah change a bit even change a bit also cannot they say according to ken you must have additional information where you approach someone for conference and papers uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm he makes it so difficult for me you know wherever we discuss something he he wants it to be perfect  word  aiyah don't know he's a perfectionist what what to do right he's only a perfectionist when it comes to work okay when it comes to his house his room it's different why very untidy uh i tell you everything is all over you know where he's to search then he's got to take out this and so you're you're must settle down fast i'm not going to do his laundry or tidy up his room for him and anyway he says he's the kind who wants word  not to be tidied so he he knows where is it in his untidy position no different uh before he get married probably he said this after he get married he want everything to be spick and span lah are you sure ya i think so uh that's you okay that's because serene has been word   word  i don't care ni wen da lor okay wo hui wen da lor nah ni qu wen da uh i see i'll see i'll see i'll see the time limit of the presentation is eight minutes oh there are some that are twelve ten minutes uh does it probably they say there's a limit lah you know maybe you can go definitely below eight minutes uh okay five minutes will do lah hor okay right hor five six five minutes is a bit too short lah probably can uh you see you give an introduc you see you give an introduction of uh tna beta give an introduction of uh i don't need to why must you give introduction all i do is present results right why not but not necessary what i mean depending on the audience uh some may not know what is tna beta and so on give a very brief introduction say twenty seconds i'm very scared you know frankly and then expression and secretion uh inside cells then after this thirty seconds then after that your results and so on maybe should be no problem what eight minutes i don't know i'm very scared huh ya seriously sixteen of june whoa double celebration for you then after this i've to go for that aiyah washington one is another one uh uhm and i haven't even done anything on it yet you know washington one i also haven't do anything what i mean i don't even have results to tell yet leh oh results uh haven't done anything haven't got results haven't got my clones for that one yet you know so how very worried you know left how many more month but you submitted that abstract already right so how did you write that abstract ya we just assume that it's going to be like this the because i got two clones uh one is with the signal sequence one is innate sequence uh huh so assume that not me okay dr yap says just assume that the signal sequence is comparatively the same lah for uhm i see i see well like that lor i'll ask kee cheng about it lor so ask kee cheng so you're supposed to carry out experiments and then uh prove that lah ya ya  two ladies from china came in - spoke in mandarin  anyway by the way they have some codes you see signals you know where nobody will understand no we don't is that right anyway actually i was thinking of sending him the newspaper article i've already cut but i don't know whether they will say anything or not fax to him uh you mean ya i don't know word  i mean down here should be alright but i don't know about the other side because i i pay why you mean they are very stern and strict about i really do not know i thought you were there before i mean i never go through faxes and so on you know but when i was in germany i word  they're quite alright you mean they were alright  what do you mean by they were alright in the sense that whatever that was faxed under my name they just give it to me lah they don't really question or anything like that you see but i don't know about taxes we are we are doing a a a mini-project testing our voice we're sending this to kenneth ya ya really we'll send this to kenneth then he'll play and then hopefully he'll remember her sweet voice you see you mean her ugly voice maybe they selected all the papers first no they already tell you that it's officially selected already ya meaybe the the posters that one they send later the talks probably they give you word  ya don't try and flatter me okay i don't count this probably but this' a to prc lady) the point is that i was asking for a poster they gave me a talk i'm supposed to present a talk and it's so nerve-racking that i don't want that with talk by the way they have upgraded her to uh dr helen chai please lah i mean i mean serious you know i don't want to have a talk you know how come this company this company is a very famous company you know is it ya word company i think one of the first big brother company in singapore to produce word
