""
""
you know what i feel like
""
""

""
""
i feel like my students' doing the the interaction in the lab
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
you say what now uh
""
you say or i say uh
""
okay lah you say lah
""
""
okay lah
""
so how uh today what time you're going to cut your hair
""
""
i thought it's five o'clock
""
""
okay
""
""
and i thought you're the one with the problem
""
""
actually uh i need to go down because uhm i need to go down
earlier because i need to drop my brother's uhm
""
""
mug shot
""
""
cid stuff you know with all his fingerprints
""
so maybe i don't know
""
do you do you feel like going down earlier too
""
""
can no problem
""
""
cos it's at it's at maxwell road
""
it's pretty near i think
""
""
uhm what do you you
""
you just have to drop it or you have to go just see the guy
""
""
just drop it ya but i've to call them first because the last
time they gave me such a hard time
""
""
why
""
""
he wanted to know if it was male or female and then if i when
i asked him for another one he said oh what do you want it for
""
you know
""
so i said oh just in case i lose it
""
""
ya but why do you have to call them
""
i mean
""
""
because it says on the form ninth to twelfth
""
""
ah
""
""
but when i called earlier at about one something she said the
office opens again at two
""
so if they close at five then maybe i can drop it there you see
""
""
oh
""
""
ya
""
""
nine to twelve
""
""
and the officer is quite handsome also

""
""
i think we should write to ahrya
""
""
ya i think so too
""
""
and i think we should uhm
""
""
but you see all that depends uh on whether uh we can extend
our stay
""
""
ya
""
""
and that's what we need to know first
""
i mean you know but i don't know
""
i mean he seems so unsure about it
""
""
ya and preoccupied too i think
""
""
half of the time i don't understand what's you know what the
whole thing is about
""
so and anyway there's trouble in paradise
""
trouble in paradise ya
""
""
ya
""
""
but uhm ya i i think i really i'd like to see ahrya and annu
and uh
""
""

""
""
uhm
""
""

""
""
i wish we could stay longer
""
that's the problem when you have so many things to do
""
""
bo lui leh
""
""
oops no money
""
""
no ya the problem is not the leave
""
yesterday you know uhm annet annet kath and she goes
""
""
where
""
""
kath
""
downstairs
""
""
oh i thought maybe at the concert
""
""

""
ooh
""
""
uhm
""
""

no no no
""
i met her down you know in the canteen and then she was saying
that uhm it's going to take ten thousand dollars for five weeks
""
i nearly died
""
""
what do you mean
""
""
she says you need ten thousand dollars to stay there five
weeks
""
""
that's a lot of money
""
""
ya she asked me you know how long i'll stay before i go work
""
can't really afford to stay very you know for a very long time
""
""
ya
""
what's your budget nuh
""
""
i don't know i haven't worked it out yet
""
""
i think you should sit down and do it you know
""
""
ya and then she goes oh you know she thought
""
i didn't have the leave and then  word  that
""
i've plenty of like five weeks
""
i think she almost died
""
""
ya i've got about the same too
""
got about i think it's slightly less than you
""
about five weeks hor
""
""
ya i'll probably take a couple of days here and there you
know
""
""
uhm
""
""
and then the rest it's open
""
but i don't know i mean aiyah
""
i don't know i don't know whether i should take it all there
""
i don't think i can afford to much as i would like to
""
""
uhm ya
""
okay
""
""
but the thing is we really have to find out you know whether
uhm it can be extended because then we can think about whether we want to buy
the eurail or the britrail or what rail
""
""
ya ya
""
""
or just cycle around the whole place
""
""
i'd like to cycle in amsterdam
""
""
you know your bikes will get stolen
""
""
i know
""
they only have a six-month lifespan
""
""
probably less now
""
""
before it changes owners
""
""
and uhm yesterday utta told me it takes six hours to drive
from uh just outside hanover to calais
""
no not six hours
""
""
ah where's calais
""
""
france
""
""
is that france
""
france
""
""
france
""
""
french town
""
""
uh ya
""
you know the where you get the uhm ferry to go across to dover
""
""
is that why they say calais  word 
""
""
i don't know
""
ya so it'll be kind of fun
""
""
uh ya
""
""
if we could do it that way but
""
""
ya you know what
""
i was i meant to tell you this uh
""
do you think uh i should knuckle down and learn how to drive a
stit- shift car
""
""
oh it's not six hours jacky
""
it's longer
""
huh stit-shift
""
""
uh
""
""
uh
""
""
because is it cheaper to rent a stit-shift there uh
""
""
i don't know
""
never rented any thing others
""
""
because if it is then i'm going to learn now
""
""
really
""
""
ya
""
""
which car are you going to bash up jacky
""
""
any one nuh
""
""
oh ya
""
""
i'm not picky
""
what do you think uh
""
""
ya go ahead
""
""
or maybe i should uhm just rent an automatic
""
""
the thing is i i i don't know
""
you know i haven't
""
maybe we should go down and get some brochures from the course
""
""
ya
""
""
because i can't remember whether it's cheaper to to take a
train and then you know grab a bus or something
""
""
i like to take train because you meet all sorts of people in
them
""
""
ya or to  word  drive
""
""
 word  you know you can share food and get
to know them and who knows what might happen
""
""
ya true true
""
""
ya
""
so we need to work it out lah
""
rail versus car
""
""
ya but the but i think the the good thing about the car is
you know you just you have your bags in your car and your  word
 you know everything with you
""
you don't
""
you don't really have to dump them anywhere and i i mean the uk is
no problem driving so
""
""
ya and then we can send like postcard to brenda
""
""
maybe
""
ya ya you know say hi how are you
""
wish you were here
""
we'd like to converse with the tape-recorder
""
ya maybe we should go and get uhm you know the brochures from avis
""
""
ya
""
""
and  word  and all those places
""
""
 word  how does the tune go uh
""
""
keep on trying
""
""
what is that
""
""
trying we try harder avis ya
""
""

""
""

""
""
