for a goal kick then to uh trengganu in this the twenty-six minutes of this second-half no scores then singapore nil and trengganu nil but we witnessed at least three golden opportunities to have scored singapore at least with one clear shot by trengganu that even that that didn't materialise certainly been a night of misses so trengganu going for that uh one point against singapore here happily in a second position up there right on top uh second only to johor then trengganu then sabah and selangor singapore fighting very very hard to get into the uh quarter finals and of course not to be uh relegated even in the penalty area one uh is leah trying one went over the goal line david lee asking for the ball to be brought back and as the minutes tick away the fifty thousand here getting a little impatience we've seen a good match an extremely good match but nothing to uh to count for sudiah dali on the left getting way pass the randasander still with it now singapore's uh uh haslim a lovely ball there effectively right across the field down to zukifli now singapore for triads with uh jocky john falling down getting himself up again but trengganu now ledging themselves to this ball and crossing it into the singapore half singapore rushing down to defend still with the ball a long try this must come from this man uh zabric i think it is now the near side number fifteen rosli ishak the man we saw coming in just now nodi word of singapore managing to swat that attack down to haskin harun haslim from the centre he streams word off the ball extremely well down to wing onn on that very far side wing onn trying to beat one man that man is hasnan ahmad he doesn't quite get way pass that man and so trengganu now retaliate from their own half trying to get away referee saw that bit of pushing there uh by uh let's see now it was uh zukifli and he has awarded a free kick for trengganu uh in their own half just just about centre of their own half ball quickly taken ball goes down to tusma hosmak and hosmak uh due to word  sends it back to his skipper zubit ibrahim with great force uh challenging him in the process zubit drops tracks and drops gets off the head of uh eusoff now it's saishuno and shuko in a clash there with uh trengganu boy tempers flaring and my goodness gracious me that was a bit  word going around here we have malin randa and there seem to be a little fight here roklin with steven daivd lee coming in the thick of it all malin vandasanda getting a little bit hot behind the collar growing in the word there but i think the referee has got the situation well in control the police are coming and bar them on the track the referee will certainly have to give the red card at least to at least one or two one singaporean i think also but uh well let's see how the referee handle this situation he's got malin vandasanda pulled into the side and he's also got said shuko now said shuko was also instrumental in that little bit of flare up said shuko was brought down and now they've got their names taken in the infamous book of the referee let's see the colour of the card that comes off well you know looking from that angle they're now shifting my eyes to the left we see drinks coming in and both the teams sharing a cup or two we have temas hosmak a yellow card uh awarded to both malin vandasanda and sye said shuko that's pretty mild i would say because uh it was uh almost bordering on uh a fist fights here at the national stadium and i think a yellow card to uh malin vandasanda and singapore's said shuko i guess is a fair a fair decision but nevertheless having said that we still have that man in trengganu still on the ground he's been there for the past three or four minutes and he is uh rosli ishak right the man we saw coming in just will word  replacing arifin osman he was a man uh uh well i wouldn't say instrumental but at least he was in the thick of it all the cause of little uh fracas here at the national stadium now he's been uh uh place on a stretcher and uh carried off by four i think they must be from saint saint john's ambulance brian uh one of the reasons uh malin vandasanda lost his uh cool for a moment was because uh said shoko the man who uh inflicted that uh injury on rosli ishak and hadn't scratched it out but oh but he's up and he's back into the field of play once again so it makes you wonder whether that was serious enough to warrant that incident you know brian that is the epitome of play acting as i was saying uh malin vandasanda is very very frustrated because said shuko has been doing an extremely good job of shackling him and uh this of course uh gave him the opportunity of uh pushing said shuko and trying to take the law into his own hands you know uh it is very very humourous because there was rosli ishak in the thick of it all he was trying to gain the sympathy of the referee he was lying motionless on the field of play for about three minutes he even had the stretcher transported from the field of play out of the field of play and when he looked around he had found that everyone a yellow card he bounced back got himself off the stretcher and ran back and took up position now that is i think uh warrants a contract a contract probably with sbc i've seen a lot of things in these past years brian but that i think i must really take my hat off to him on the you you gonna say something are you well anyway well he didn't want to see his team down uh to ten men and uh in fact he sees a replacement for arifin osmund so he had to get back into the thick of action well now it's trengganu then one uh is uh well have ball is got the ball shot right across the head of uh zulkifi it still uh uh little bit of dangerous situation for singapore because the action was dated back now greg foster greg foster for letting a true ball on the far side of the field can jocky john get himself to the ball no he can't greg was in for the for second attempt then he gets himself to the ball then a very side is that uh uh ushami lock wing onn now on the near side here this is word  the long ball coming to the sidelines here grim slightly uh uh trengganu half hasni trying to get it back into play again a push out to touch and hasim will just have to content with just a throw in well the pace of this uh match is really fast and furious as both teams go for one another singapore desperately needing to win trengganu trying to hold on to at least a goal as draw and come away with a point share points here with singapore in singapore's home tie in this semi-pro cup tie against trengganu and there's still no score at the moment trengganu in attack a long ball word the top of the singapore penalty area to the head of malin vandasandan who knocks it down to wan izila keeps it in play and he sends it to rosli ishak back to wan izila izila's his ball across the ball to malin vandasandan and it's the boys sulia dali into the middle of the pitch it goes it's anybody ball as the ball uh keeps on word  and leaving and haslim harun picks it up and he went straight into the trengganu defence defeats one two three but not the third man he was beaten there by the trengganu defender zabri mohammud nor doing very well rosli ishak picks it up in mid-field right now but he couldn't keep control of the ball it goes to touch corner throw in to singapore to be taken by singapore's left quarter-back sudia dali dali very quickly down to foster foster juggling the ball looking for a teammate he finds zulkifli zulkifli sending it back to foster the goal-keeper was out of position that's the reason why the crowd word  foster to get on with the game and uh apparently the defender who stopped haslim from uh going through on his own was zabri mohammud nor he's flat on the ground and the goal-keeper zubir ibrahim wanted to bring the referee's attention to this injured player zabri mohammud nor and he was completely out of position whereas the referee allowed play to continue and he was in a situation where he would have been out of position had uh foster crossed the ball earlier and singapore would have scored and he was very very upset he wanted to go for the referee but one of his defenders stopped him from doing so and attention now that play has been halted ttention has been given to this injured player zabri mohammud nor and he's been taken care of right now the stretcher boys are on the pitcher play and they've got him on a stretcher and he's got to go to the far side of the field in the meantime uh i think a goal kick is gonna be given to trengganu we've got something like uh thirty-five thirty-six minutes of play gone by thirty-six minutes of play gone by in this second-half trengganu nil singapore nil goal kick taken by their keepers zabir ibrahim right into the middle of the pitch it goes singapore picking it up haslim harun with the ball relays it to foster foster down to wing onn yes and a shot here a golden opportunity for singapore to score and wing onn turned around very quickly with his left leg he putted towards his trengganu goal the goal-keeper was out of position but uh fortunately for trengganu the ball went high and wide for a goal kick so they live again to fight and they intend to do just that as they match singapore in pace and determination keeping their score lying clean no score at the moment singapore desperately needing to win as trengganu come back right now malin vandasanda with the ball in the singapore half he comes at the top of the bucks he crosses only for boran ahdusamad to clear over to haslim haslim bringing the ball forward playing the fetch and carry role he crosses the ball to the far side over to wing onn wing onn is free he's got one man to beat now he beats the man crosses the ball yes and it's clear the way by zagariah musah and he's clearing to touch for a touch in to singapore what exciting moments here in the national stadium as the fifty thousand fans rise and cheer all these exciting moments they're enjoying it but what they really want is a goal from the home team are they gonna get it and we don't have very much time left trengganu i'm sure will be very very happy very pleased with themselves if they can come away with a draw singapore in the mean time putting the pressure on trengganu as they get another corner haslim swings the ball in zubir got his uh hands behind that ball there was a bit of a push on zubir ibrahim and the referee's awarded the free kick to trengganu zubri
