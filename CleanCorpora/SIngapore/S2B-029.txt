""
i'm lisa and welcome to hey singapore
""
tonight our story is more of curiosity rather than a mystery
""
it's about inventions local inventions
""
inventions that were patented as early as the nineteen sixties
""
many of these inventions can be found in the files of cesa
""
today singaporeans continue to put down their patents
""
unfortunately due to the high costs of producing a prototype and
mass production many of them remained just patent inventions
""
today we go in search for the inventive singaporean
""
tonight we dig into the little known world of local inventors and
their inventions starting with this strange gadget
""
what is it
""
well it's used on something close to many of us
""
in fact it was invented to deal with a very thorny issue
""
we asked some people what they thought it was
""
no one seems to have any idea
""
what is it
""
well the answer lies here at the ngee ann polytechnic
""
you see the strange device is the work of these students who are
about to reveal to us what it does
""
watch closely
""
a durian opener
""
these final year students took about three months to think up of
the idea and to make the device from scratch
""
this unusual opener can soon be available for a mere twenty dollars
""
our producer decided to try her hand on the durian opener after a
few false starts she finally gets the hang of it
""
and she does find it quite effective
""
but this is just our amateur opinion would the experts agree
""
we brought the durian opener here at the junction of albert and
queen street to put it to the test
""
seems no one is willing to give our strange looking tool a try
until we come across mr chong with many years behind him selling durians
""
he was not impressed
""
not satisfied we sought a second opinion mr ong is another long
time durian seller maybe he has a different opinion
""
but he didn't have an easy time of it
""
after much sweating and swearing he managed to open a durian
""
so all's not lost
""
the durian sellers we spoke to were somewhat encouraging they felt
that the durian opener might be more useful for housewives than for the
professionals
""
but the idea is a good one and with some modifications perhaps this
durian opener might be more effective
""
our next invention is one that starts here where we came across an
unusual phenomenon
""
locked letterboxes what good are locked letterboxes
""
how will the postman deliver the mail
""
we traced these unusual letterboxes to a local inventor mr henry
tan
""
henry an ex-police constable of many years started working on an
idea to keep junk mail out of our letter boxes
""
an anti-junk mail letter box
""
the path to the final product did not come easily
""
it began with sketches and drawings followed by many prototypes the
earliest which is this one
""
how did henry come on the idea for an anti-junk mail letter box
""
he told us he was once nearly arrested for littering when clearing
his junk mail
""
so for all of us in hdb units maybe an end to junk mail
""
hdb and a bright sunny day
""
perfect for housewives to hang out their freshly washed clothes to
dry
""
or is it
""
living in high-rise flats we all encounter the problem of
inconsiderate neighbours who let their wet clothes drip all the way down
""
down to our carefully washed laundry and what happens
""
our clothes become soiled of course
""
is there a solution
""
yes there is
""
at the temasek polytechnic school of engineering
""
we asked mr ? ? teo and his students what they have come up with
""
a retractable clothes shelter
""
this device is unique because it lets heat rays in through the
transparent shelter to dry the clothes but protects the clothes from being
soiled
""
the invention can be commercialised though it cost the students
three hundred dollars to build it
""
mass production should bring the price down
""
so now there's no need to get frustrated or irritated
""
just go get retractable clothes shelter
""
and all this dripping and soiling of our freshly washed clothes
will be a thing of the past
""
well although some of you may find that a rather strange invention
it's actually quite a practical idea
""
we are now here at the national archives retro-spin
""
an exhibition of sounds in singapore from the fifties to the
nineties and it is here at this exhibition that we were to make an amazing
discovery
""
this man here jay shotam he was the lead singer of one of the most
popular groups in singapore called the october cherries back in the nineteen
seventies
""
jay and his brother claimed that they patented the first portable
cassette player and filed it in london in nineteen seventy-six
""
unfortunately due to lack of funds for mass production the patent
lapsed
""
when we come back we speak to jay shotam and we take a look at some
other amazing inventions by singaporeans
""
early this year the national archives was planning an exhibition of
the sounds of singapore from the fifties
""
the exhibition is on at the national museum to the twenty second of
september and it was here that we were to uncover a most unusual story
""
the story of a man named jay shotam lead singer the group october
cherries who claimed he patented the portable cassette player now more
commonly called the walkman
""
it's here that we meet mr jay shotam he has an amazing story to
tell us
""
a story so fantastic that we won't have believed it if not for the
evidence
""
if you think that the concept behind the portable cassette player
came from japan you may well be mistaken
""
about twenty years ago four years before the launched product jay
had invented a combined portable cassette player and headphone set
""
in the old days if you wanted to listen to music on the move well
you had to lurk one of these around
""
this is the story of mr jay shotam the rest as they say is history
""
we move on to the other end of singapore to find our next local
inventor
""
he's mr pang lian seng and he's been dabbling in inventions for the
past twenty years
""
we asked him what he had come up with and he pulled this out of his
bag
""
a self-cleaning duster
""
the duster works with a cleaning material mounted on rollers a
device inside removes chalk dust and other particles that collect in a
reservoir
""
mr pang had patented his invention not only in singapore but also
as far away as uk
""
why so many patents
""
he tells us there isn't a body for world-wide patents and if
inventors wanted to protect their ideas world-wide they must take up
individual patents issued i each country
""
back in the ngee ann polytechnic we had come across a durian opener
""
well here another local culinary dish caught the attention of
another group of students
""
? ? satay grilling machine
""
electric heaters inside this contraption cooks satay as the satay
swirls around inside
""
but the most important question is does the satay still taste as
good as those grilled over glowing charcoal
""
and here are more wacky inventions from our ngee ann polytechnic
students
""
when we come back after the break we take a look at how one man
invented a product which is currently used by penguins and others who are
still trying to make their inventive dream a reality
""
our search for local inventions has led us to the singapore bird
park more specifically to the penguin display
""
amazingly we learned that the health and well-being of these
penguins are partly dependent on a singaporean invention
""
the germitrol what is the germitrol
""
to find out we tracked down mr derek seah owner of air search
technology
""
and the germitrol an air cleaner that kills germs
""
this idea crew from a unique experience
""
but how do you measure whether germs air-borne germs emphasises
derek are effectively killed
""
this device does it
""
armed now with a better idea of the germitrol we decided to check
it out in action
""
here inside the penguin enclosure
""
a rare opportunity to be on the other side of the glass
""
amidst these curious and nosy penguins we saw the installed units
working away to keep the air germ-free for these birds
""
although the germitrol works invisibly dr wong from the bird park
ensures us the units work
""
the penguins are not the only ones benefiting from the invention
these little puffins who also live in enclosed artificially maintained
environments also benefit from the germitrol
""
we're pretty sure that when derek first drew up his sketches and
prototypes he wasn't thinking of penguins and puffins but the invention has a
way of ending up in the most unexpected places
""
we leave our feathered friends and head east to eunos
""
he had wind of another local inventor frequently around the area
""
he's mr gan chiu liang and his invention
""
a strange looking crate
""
what is it
""
well we have to curb our curiosity as mr gan can only demonstrate
his invention elsewhere
""
our destination here at the marina square
""
we stopped at this half hour photo lab and waited patiently for mr
gan to arrive which he soon did
""
putting together his invention was a puzzle as mr gan started with
this camera
""
then this a special laser printer
""
in minutes mr gan finally had his invention up and running
""
what does it do
""
this is mr gan's visual card system a system that creates and
prints cards lie these or this
""
our crew tried mr gan's visual card system and we learned a unique
feature of the system
""
have your own photo on your name card so that's what the camera's
for
""
how does it all work
""
well it uses ordinary photographic film
""
we watched as the designs we had created appeared in this photo
processing machine
""
and as the pictures appear we saw our camera man a photo of
himself on his very own personalised name card all in about half an hour
""
name cards are not the only things you can create with mr gan's
system
""
how about giving away a unique birthday invitation like this one
""
so singaporeans especially teenagers can look forward to creating
anything
""
these samples should give you an idea of what to expect
""
though still in a prototype stage we were impressed that only with
this but also the other inventions of singapore you have seen today
""
though some inventions may not be that practical we did come
across a few very enthusiastic inventors with rather brilliant ideas
""
some of which have been taken up on by manufacturers and are
currently out in the market
""
others remain in their planning stages
""
and for anyone that makes it in the market hundreds remain
untouched
""
but inventors being inventors never give up
""
i'm lisa goodnight

""
the body's need for fluid is often neglected until one feels
thirsty
""
by the time you feel thirsty enough to reach for a drink you are
already dehydrated
""
next to oxygen water is a silent nutrient that is most needed for
life
""
besides keeping body temperatures stable water carries nutrients
eliminates toxins and waste products maintains blood volume and provides the
medium in which self-chemical reactions occur
""
if too much fluid is lost blood pressure falls and less oxygen
gets to the brain
""
in addition blood thickens and can't reach small blood vessels
""
each person needs at least two litres of water a day
""
even if you are inactive your body loses up to two litres of water
a day
""
believe it or not that's six to eight glasses so it's important to
drink regularly even if you are not thirsty
""
just watch out for caffeine laden beverage and alcohol
""
though they are fluid sources they actually dehydrate the body
after consumption
""
for pure drinking water is good
""
liquid intake not only comes from beverages or the water we drink
it's also in foods so they too can count towards your daily intake
