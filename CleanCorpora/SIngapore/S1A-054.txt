""
""
after making uh

once ah my uhm went out  word  the the whole
family was making this popiah you know make and eat make and eat
""
i ate about four or five you know

that that was early in the morning and then after that tea time

""
i just couldn't eat lah
""
""
and the worse is that when i cook my own dinner our our i
won't eat it
""
i won't eat definitely
""
like that day last night i was cooking spaghetti for a meal the the
the mouth  word  forty-five minutes already right
""
after i've done it put on the table
""
i just don't want to eat
""
""
ha
""
""
i don't like to cook because i cannot enjoy my meal after that
""
""
oh is it
""
i don't mind like i can still eat
""
""
is it
""
i can i don't i lose my appetite
""
""
ha
""
don't know maybe because i don't cook very often
""
""
i don't cook at all
""
""
i mean back in perth i cook twice a week
""
""
oh is it
""
then the other
""
""
i think i was the only one who do the cooking in the household
""
""
the rest of them you all take turns is it
""
""
ya we take turns lah
""
two twice a week then
""
""
 word 
""
""
one day we rotate lah
""
every sunday ya
""
sometimes we don't want to cook
""
""
cook two meals right
""
""
uhm no only cook dinner
""
lunch we all settle by ourselves
""
""
cook for the whole three of you is it
""
""
three of us only lor
""
""
then what do you cook
""
rice the basic uh rice soup
""
""
rice
""
usually we just cook two dishes one meat one vegie
""
then maybe sometimes we have soup
""
but usually if we cook soup we put the meat inside so we still
have about two dishes
""
""
oh then chin chye eat lah
""
""
ya lor chin chye lor
""
what can you do
""
""
it's not like wah four five dishes no need uh
""
""
cannot ah
""
how to afford
""
we are trying to save money
""
""
not only that a lot of time you have to you know
""
""
ya
""
""
actually you don't need that much
""
for me uh i i just fry an egg
""
""
ah
""
""
i can i can eat whatever like that know
""
""
ya
""
my household they don't really like to eat eggs
""
""
oh i love eggs
""
""
ah for me also second year i always cook eggs
""
""
i love egg you know
""
""
ya
""
""
half-boil half-boil fry scramble
""
""
ya ya i love eggs
""
ya omelette
""
""
anyway when nobody's at home right i just make egg
""
so easy
""
it's the easiest dish
""
anyway when you cook noodle you throw an egg inside
""
""
ya ya i throw an egg inside
""
""
eat with bread
""
you you get me hard boil egg as well
""
""
aye i like i like egg sandwiches
""
""
i like i like too
""
aye one day we make ah
""
""
egg
""
""
i think we should do it because every breakfast is you gotta
spend a lot of money
""
or you say that once in a while we eat it's okay but having here
and there i think
""
""
quickly makes up
""
""
and in and we remove it high it can be quite expensive
""
""
ya that is true
""
""
then you order a drink everyday
""
so i think when he ask me about stationery as you were saying up
we should we both should do it together because then i won't leave or
anything
""
i think we should have a pantry
""
pantry most important
""
""
we need a fridge
""
no get those small fridge
""
""
ya lah small fridge
""
but even so i don't know okay
""
i think we should agree not in any need of fridge
""
i think we need a little bit of  word  not oven
""
""
oven-toaster
""
toaster
""
""
not toaster
""
bread-toaster
""
that type you know just heat up a little bit of food
""
""
ya bread-toaster lor
""
""
don't you think not not bread-toaster
""
bread-toaster
""
""
oven-toaster lah
""
""
is just for bread
""
""
ya ya ya those oven-toaster
""
""
ah oven-toaster
""
i think we should you know
""
it's very practical
""
""
but i think we we don't yet slowly lah
""
we get the more essential things first
""
""
fridge is it
""
""
fridge
""
""
fridge is important
""
we can store things inside
""
""
ya but
""
""
like you put your fruits you bring from home
""
you put your fruits
""
you throw inside then then
""
""
but not in a hurry
""
yet we get the other things first like the desk and all that first
""
""
we need only one more desk
""
""
one desk
""
""
then chair
""
""
what chair
""
""
chair
""
we don't need a chair
""
""
don't need ah
""
""
there can
""
you see we got four chairs here already what
""
""
okay lor
""
""
okay this desk is boon
""
that one is for me
""
yours will be the same one
""
all three of ours three of us should get the same chairs and
tables
""
of course he will have this big chair
""
if he wants to get another table he should get a bigger one for
himself
""
at least both of us share the kind of table
""
then there won't be some kind of discrepancy
""
this one will be for this computer like when you are not at your
desk working you want to go to the computer you move the computer
""
okay so we need another desk we need
""
i think we need two cupboards
""
ah how many cupboards do you think we need
""
""
i think at the moment we don't need more than one cabinet
because he hasn't finished using this one you see
""
""
he has quite a lot of things already
""
""
really
""
i think he needs to clear because he has a lot of repeated and all
those brochures and everything
""
all repeated
""
""
i'm never dare to touch
""
i i mean at least jason help him to
""
""
maybe he has uh ya some kind of cabinet lah
""
""
just now do you realise he was looking around for something
""
""
is it
""
""
you won't believe it
""
""
no
""
he need something for storing his film
""
""
i don't know what kind of
""
you need a special cabinet
""
""
but how long does the film last ha
""
does it expire after a while
""
""
you keep it properly it can last
""
""
it can last ah
""
""
look at the way he has kept
""
it's it's expose to light most of the time and this thing rub up
and down
""
i i think it's personally that he need a big cabinet
""
""
oh
""
""
so we need a film cabinet
""
even we don't have a cabinet
""
we can buy those kind of bags
""
""
bags
""
""
big bag then you just put inside
""
""
i thought of buying boxes
""
""
box can lah
""
box can
""
""
boxes
""
ikea boxes
""
""
okay okay
""
okay then we get another of this cabinet
""
do you want to get this type
""
this looks very ugly
""
""
but it's basic
""
this is the standard office cabinet
""
""
i think for both of us we need some kind of cupboard also
right
""
""
for our own
""
""
do we
""
""
no lah we
""
""
come out ah
""
our thing will start piling out on the table already
""
""
ya you need files
""
""
we need some kind of files filing system for our own lah
""
no
""
when you start carrying a lot of things like you send your
graphics everything instead of having like maybe yours we have a carrier and
the other one the thing is you need to systematically keep
""
you can't just store up here know
""
look at mine
""
i mean i've been trying my best to keep it clean then he comes and
he meddle up all over again
""
""
ya that's true
""
my previous office we have a lot of files one on the table
""
""
i think we should
""
but here no file no no ta
""
""
no files
""
""
what i mean files on the table
""
""
oh files on the table  word 
""
""
i think we should get those types of shelf
""
""
shelves ah
""
""
we should
""
we can maximise space that way you know
""
think that shelf you can you put a few file
""
then put one on top there so it looks really it looks like it's
part of the desk
""
""
that looks like your bedroom
""
""
no you can
""
i don't know whether he'll allow if we put shelves
""
shelves maximise space
""
""
but for us it's very unoffice like you know
""
""
really
""
if we can make it very cosy
""
when do we have to be office like
""
""
ya
""
""
what's more
""
we're advertising agency you know
""
so it must be as creative as possible
""
when i went to weli ads right it was so cute you know
""
""
ya is it
""
""
the receptionist sits at this little room where you first go
in right
""
then they have this banana tree
""
fake banana tree and a monkey
""
big look quite big
""
""
so cute
""
""
the monkey's quite quite tall lah
""
up to here
""
then they have a little treasure box
""
you open up right then they throw their stuff there
""
but it's like a treasure box so it's very cute
""
then it's a shophouse so you walk up
""
""
oh that's cute
""
""
walk up right with a winding
""
then you walk up
""
""
alright
""
""
then they have this lounge not they call it a lounge right
""
you sit around and they have meeting there and the table uh is
cane you know
""
it's not those type of office table you know
""
it's cane
""
""
actually i think we should standardise all cane
""
""
and and the chair
""
we require all cane you know
""
it's all very nice
""
and then it's quite cosy
""
and then you have a little bar counter
""
don't know why
""
""
wah
""
""
it's their it's their pantry but they make it like a bar
counter so it's high pi  word  high chair you know
""
high stool and a little thing and then
