i would like to uh welcome all of you uh to this uh fourth biotech workshop for teachers can i just for a show of hand in case somebody here has last year for this workshop if you have come here before you don't have to come again i can give you the certificate take the book and go somewhere don't tell anybody in anyway somebody has just realised that she has come twice no okay so this is your first time here right uhm i'll just fill you in with some background of the workshop that we have uh done so far for the past three years we've been running uh this workshop in 1990 uh we ran and 1991 we ran the workshop for cover the junior college teachers and when we finished uhm the whole lot of junior college teachers we have to go on now to the secondary school teachers and last year second uh some of half or probably a third of secondary school teachers came and this year we are doing the rest uh i'm not sure if we have covered all but uh if we have not then uhm next year we might have to run another one so uhm unless there is a change in policy anywhere whether it's from science centre or from ministry of education then we will uh adjust the curriculum of this workshop accordingly right so uh this could well be the last in the series so i hope you'll uh find this uh uh workshop uh a profitable one our head of department sends uh uh professor kon oi lian sends her apologies for not being able to word word  you address you uh she's taken away for uh an important meeting so she asked me to say uh a few words of welcome on her behalf uh we are very pleased to be involved in this uh project uh in joint collaboration with science centre the singapore society for biochemistry and molecular biology uh then the sponsorship of the economic development board uh to hold this uh kind of workshop as we all know that the uh biotechnology is an important industry in uh there is growth of importance in uh western nations is therefore essential for singapore to have some kind of uh economic some kind of in growth into this very type of industry and to do that we need to raise the general awareness of uh biotechnology among the populous that is why uhm one reason why uh the edb is sponsoring this uhm workshop under its education and public awareness scheme under the umbrella of the national biotechnology programme was uh started in 1990 but uh at this point they are many new word to this in biotechnology and that is why our students of today would become the workforce of tomorrow and uh they should at least have some understanding of biotechnology all we reach students we need to be school and we are educators that is why we have this workshop uhm here today uh because uh we may face some uh the uh rush later on maybe it'll be easier if i were to give you your certificate word  i i i trust you all completely i noticed that uh ex uh there are no uh miss mrs anne dhanaraj is not here yes mrs mary toh is also not here miss yeo is also not here so i think it's okay i can give it to you alright uhm the first few sections are the introduction and word  word uhm followed by uhm the green notes of the the introductory notes of the lecture followed by the laboratory schedule there are four practicals that we will be doing in an hour and uh plus you'll be amazed that how many things you could do in four hours uh four in in in a short span of one hour plus and that would be followed by uh several demonstrations which we'll divide you into several groups and then we'll go in a circus word if you don't want you can uh uh uh you can move along to the next one if you're not interested in whatever station it is okay it's not a case of uh do not pass go or do not collect two hundred dollars straight to jail word word  well if you're not interested in a particular section just move on okay so it's uh very easy going i hope you have uh relaxing afternoon in view of the stress that we face as educators of our administrators all the time uh that is uh off the off the record uhm so uh do refer to these notes that are when we come to that section now okay uh there are some supplementary notes to accompany these demonstrations and uh word  i would like now to introduce uh mrs anne dhanaraj who has been working very hard behind the scenes to make sure that uh this project gets proper funding and uh she's done a lot of work in uh getting our booklet ready for us and uh we in the past few uhm past three years she's been working also very hard making sure that our provide that continuity in the four workshops that we've conducted so far and she's of course aided by many of her able assistants who are here with her today and they are seated at the back we acknowledge their their uhm very enthusiastic support for this biotech workshop in fact i might would like to ask her in fact to say a few words with regard to uh to the uh the new uh exhibits that will be in stored in science centre soon in the pipeline secret at the moment so what's this phase okay so uhm there will be a brief break where you can have some refreshments uh in the middle i am sorry it's a bit modest one uhm in view of the fact that we want to save avoid being too much of a consumer so i shall not uhm move on quickly to uh first part of our today's uh uh word  did you all a word outline of the the the programme they are so word  got a couple of lectures until about three o'clock and these will be very short ones announcement that we have to cater to a wide spectrum of people coming from uh diverse back from diverse background and you we have uhm assume certain target words that uhm you should know uhm and you know and this will give us our later word  stop us uhm stop me in the in the middle of my talk to ask me questions okay otherwise follow me later on and uh squeeze out definitions from me later uhm for use in practicals you can catch hold of me there are some people who came in just came in right did i miss out you certificates now we begin by uh uh discussing some ideas about what biotechnology is uh what better way than to begin in singapore the minister of state has identified biotechnology as one of the twin pillars of singapore's future economy the other being information technology and which is why uh in the nine early part of this decade the national biotechnology plans was formulated in order to spearhead singapore's entry into this new start rise so called start rise industry which has uh caused a great move in the western countries of course a lot of these uh media uh hype about hype about biotechnology was uhm overplayed up uh but we are slowly beginning to see the fruits of uhm biotechnology for instance uh recombinant human insulin is now uh in the market we have recombinant some of us may have received uh jabs of a vaccine jabs of uh uh hepatitis b vaccine previously we have to uh round up all the uh homosexuals to uh extract syrum word from them and uh try to purify these thin word particles and then try to formulate the vaccine out of them and of course that is extremely hazardous both for the for the people who prepare it as well as the recipients of this plasma based vaccine but with biotechnological approaches uh is able we are able now to produce safe vaccines for the general uh use by the population so you can see that some of these material and and later on in the practical you will see some of these biotechnology products that are hitting the consumer market that is why all the more reason we should have some basic awareness of it's all about because of the biotechnology has been word  identified as important way back in the 19 in the middle of the last decade in 1985 i remember as a a young student word to say that but student in the in the in university word in university college i i drop by at uh professor uh louie lim and chris tan  word place down in london and they were so enthusiastic about this particular new venture goh keng swee has uh mr goh keng swee has dr goh keng swee apparently had called up professor chris tan uh assigned him this task of setting up the institute of molecular and cell biology and they were so keen and word in the east end of london professor louie lim was spreading out the plans of this particular institute on his uh beautiful floor and then telling me how nice it was and uh i was hoping that i've got a place there of course i didn't uh this institute has been set up built in 1987 bring in quite a lot of uh outside talent as well as homegrown talent uh to spearhead research basic research into molecular biology and cell biology and you can see this blue building as you approach uh  word the university you can see the building set behind the uh uh greenery of uh kent ridge reserve this building with its cutting edge word at the cutting edge of research even the architecture reflects its uh role in uh spearheading singapore bi bioscience of course this research has been going on kind of research has been basic research has been going on in our de departments for a long time and some of you may identify your former mentors but we have progress a long way since these old equip type of equipments uh to sophisticated equipments such as uh this instruments uh halc type of performance or high pressured liquid chomotography uh uh equipment and not only that we have uh the research as spilled out from the laboratories to the uh to the field and you can see here a map of singapore with marked ingredients marked in green the agrotechnology word  parks uh that has been set up by the primary production department uh some of these sites are already uh ready and uh some uh agrotechnology farms have been set up so if you do have a chance to uh drive around the outskirts of singapore city do feel free to turn off the beating word  track and visit some of them word  have a look at some of these agrotechnology parks uhm some some of these uh are employing new techniques to culture or to grow orchids or hydrofornics word culture of uh all sorts of uhm vegetables and so on so again we are just not confining our our inroads into biotechnology within the laboratory but also uh in more diverse over diversified front i noticed word from yesterday that this was blocking the view yah fine i will lower this slightly now bio word allow me to focus uhm now the word biotechnology actually is a very loose term and uh many disciplines contribute to the this uh multi-disciplinary subject ranging from genetics biochemistry chemistry microbiology even across to uh the hard sciences and engineering  and uh as i describe biotechnology later on you will see why because of this multi-disciplinary approach towards biotechnology it is not surprising that there are many definitions
