 word i want you to tell me how much to change okay but have you decided roughly what word  amount i don't know how much you want what is the estimate have you all decided or not have not decided because eight hundred you all were saying for the food and the no for accommodation and entrance fees right ya but then you got the breakdown or not maybe you can ask uh beng what is the best best op do you know how much currency we need to bring how much are you estimating for food let's say per meal i don't know just bringing two thousand dollars oh two thousand uh ya then from there word  but how much are you going to change for each country five hundred when i go there then i know what oh you're just bringing all cheques is it ya word owes me two hundred and forty six dollars but it's not in currency ya ha so beng how how much do you think we should estimate per meals forty twenty forty for accommodation twenty per day but our accommodation is all fostered in right now in your latest ya but i don't see i don't think you should count it that way what i gave you was an estimate i mean are you going to take take all the money out and then separate out this is uh what moving money and that is word that means right so your two thousand includes what you have costed in your itinerary plus food and souvenirs ya ya the whole thing so that is about what we have calculated  two thousand two thousand so which means it's correct you see it's about five hundred to word  five hundred per country is it ya so if you go by her estimate in the write-up then that one each country is about two hundred fifty so we left about two hundred fifty for our own food and souvenirs then if want to bring some more cheques hor we only have four countries so word  two thousand uh ya it's enough so that's why we were intending to ask him to  word can you pass me your cash cheque cheque cheques and your name in my name uh oh okay lor okay okay in my name in my name then i write a cash cheque for them oh to the because uh the money people prefers cash cheques oh i see are you going to bring traveller's cheques ya traveller's cheques but are you going to bring cash as well ya as well mag leh you i'm intending to bring all cash you know but make it a bit of traveller's cheques all cash huh you know what i'm afraid of losing it you know you don't know whether i'll lose it or not two hundred and fifty just in case anyway we are we are sharing you know so each one of us will be only be carrying two thousand dollars two thousand for two currencies what you mean you are sharing she's going to hold two countries' currency i'm going to hold two currencies oh then if you need is that better huh i think just handling less currency that is all lah but oh the amount of the amount spent is the same so you're just going to contribute into the pool lah or something like that actually we're not even contributing i'll just buy for ya lah ya lah you know how much for the currency come back then word whatever that's the receipt for vicky for the europass so the europass is four 0 nine right ya word another four one ya i'm going to write the cheque so how so can write me a cheque will it be you have already okay i have the cheque here no but the amount is not specified  word calculator anybody got calculator i think i have i have a calculator do you know the exchange rates no i don't know the exchange rates exactly speaking roughly then based on this one right student ya roughly but usually word sing dollar two thousand and then i'll change it for you five hundred per currency ya or what but that means you will have very loose change right you may come up to the last cent and all that oh uh i thought maybe we could do it the other way like five hundred guilders or five thousand guilders then how much sing dollars per guilder word  but that means four hundred and something sing dollars  word  ah oh isn't it easier but the exchange you might not know the exchange rates or you can roughly word  just a rough rough estimate or is it easier to say i want uh five hundred worth of five hundred sing dollars worth of guilders ya then they just give you the amount right so you have come up with a few cents all the loose word is it easier this way or you're going to change but loose change is alright what they might not have loose change in fact then they might want word sing dollars from you then they might ask you to buy less sing dollar uh ya lor doesn't matter lor ya lah but roughly you would say okay about five hundred for this currency but maximum two thousand right ya because if we if we calculate now we can roughly gauge like the closest to five hundred like okay amsterdam is what ah this is already three zero one this is one currency right ya okay this is about two seventy you know three about two seven something uh 'a' but this per person right per person okay so if two persons you need three 'a' how does it work there the numbers are here oh okay three zero zero where is zero here here where's on and off three zero zero times aiyuh so confusing looking at the alphabets wrong already wrong already three zero hey i'm going to bring this along you know ya i think this is useful three zero one are you sure you can use point five point aiyah multiply okay about six zero word  for food right point two why multiply by two oh i see i see two person two person will be six hundred and three okay time three uhm then times point nine oh no for food only ya this is only for food aiyah don't need don't need i'll just do it in singapore's singapore currency uh ya then ya okay two seven two seven one two seven one point three nine three nine one word is two five word : t then my ya terrible it's too close it's too close aiyah come uh come uh two seven one point three five times two times two this and then so bring up to a thousand dollars uh the closest times times two again why times two again okay can you uhm oh minus one thousand this okay this amount would be just why don't you just calculate one thousand then you times word  you might not have enough no this one is just for accommodation and entrance fees right oh okay okay okay we need for meals and for so how ya ya ya so this is times two then you can times two again right only it's going to be another double of the amount of of accommodation so got paper or not write down the  four that's a lot ha whatever name we word  can write behind right three how much of the 'a' this one is very rough you know about this is about sing ya one zero eight five point four sing dollars right then how do you convert to guilders eight five point divide by multiply by divide by 0 nine about there lor thousand two 0 one two zero six guilders so either you can get one two 0 0 guilders or just a round up figure or a thousand guilders but i can't tell you how much they have you know huh only they will know how much they have right small change no need that means you give me a round figure one thousand guilders but she cannot get all big notes right i don't know i don't know what they have you must try and get oh it doesn't matter ya lor it it could be ya lah in word  ten smaller word  okay but it's not not too much small ones uh okay okay actually small ones also okay actually small ones are word okay what no but too much of it uh you can imagine how much you're going to carry inside can we get one thousand two hundred guilders two tens how much in sing dollars one thousand two hundred one two zero zero divide uh word point point nine dutch word right thousand eight one zero eight zero sing dollars huh one zero eight no this one is small you know we want to round up to this uh so it's one zero eight zero zero just an estimate you know okay and but did you work out like the number of days you know twenty nine ya this is four days three nights uh one zero four one zero six point five four how come uh you're not executives uh still union members uh ya lor not like you lor one four plus three four three four four plus ninety one point seven per thousand sharks! what did you do hey help oh must get it right one point point austria austria how many days uh do you know how many days ya i told you it's not how many days will we will we be in austria how many days are we in austria miss p 'a' how come cannot equal one miss p how many days are we in austria aiyah how to use your calculator how many days are we in austria count lah itinerary is there what okay two four one point six four how about sing dol rough estimate sing dollars currency see i told you it's about two hundred something in each country per estimate ya so so if i times two four one two person nah that's for one person okay four eight three point two eight this is in sing dollar ah ya you want to write down huh ya very rough one you know okay you see your paper very untidy no uh i write the rough one then later you write the proper one four eight this is only on this uh for two person okay then uhm plus this one is just times two uh times two again see how many days you know one two three four five six six days hor but then the thing is that because austria we'll be there for six days some place are cheaper some place are more expensive actually austria is expensive you know austria so maybe we should put more there but seems like it's less than this is it ya the amount is less than this actually because of all the entrances uh two four something it's all the tours that we are joining oh then don't forget mag added one more the that pleasure palace or what oh ya ya ya the funny one ya don't know what sort of where water will shoot at you from did you know there's one one watery watery fun of those tapes which are called pleasure palace is it ya what yes eeeee palace ah ya ya no halbrune pleasure castle for watery fun for wet fun
