may it please the court your honour since there is no dispute that the respondent plaintiff was incapacitated between fifth march seventy-nine and fifteenth july eight from working i won't be going into the facts relating to that the first issue here is whether he was entitled as of right to his salaries prior to the accident your honour the respondent was both a director and shareholder of seagull marine and he was also the chairman of both companies but at the same time he was also a working director of that company and his source of income would be salaries received as a working director director's fees and dividends and these are all shown on his income tax returns your honour from page one hundred and forty-five of the record of appeal in civil appeal one hundred and seventeen of eighty-seven and in fact there on occasions he has received dividends and occasions he has received directors fees on page one hundred and fifty of the record of appeal there are payments also for director's fees from another company and from page one hundred and fifty-one there were dividends paid in respect of pan asia services but this appeal only concerns his salaries which he was drawing a sum of two thousand dollars from pan asia and five hundred dollars from seagull marine and he was earning these sums even prior to the accident his income tax returns show that these were not amounts which he just decided after the accident to take as such your honour my submission is that he is an employee of the company both the companies and in this respect i would like to refer to the appellant's bundle of authorities that's the blue bundle in one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven mr benedict chan's appeal my lord bundle of authorities number eighteen of the case marked number eighteen your honour which was taken from palmer's on company law and at the bottom it's a general statement that directors are not as such employees for the company or employed by the company nor are they servants of the company or members of the staff this becomes important in three way of instances then it goes on on the next page but i would like to start on the second paragraph of the next page at page eight hundred and seventy-six where it says a director can however pull a salary employment or an office in addition to that of his directorship which way for these purposes making an employee or a servant and in such a case he would enjoy any rights given to the employees as such on the facts of our case my lord it's quite clear that he was not just a director but he was more than a director and there is no evidence your honour that he was running the company improperly so long as the companies have complied with the requirements of the company's act i do not see how one can say that it is not a separate legal entity and that actually he was paid himself and his loss was not or rather suggested that his loss was actually what the monies which he received was actually an entitlement he could be an agent on behalf of the company and at the same time he could also contract himself when he becomes an employee and one other fact is that this were not companies which were solely owned by him as your honour has pointed out in seagull marine he only owned fifty per cent his son owned fifty per cent and in pan asia he owned thirty per cent of the shares the rest were owned by his son now the court found your honour that on the evidence presented that though he continued drawing the salaries it was not paid to him as an entitlement though the court presumed that there was an employment since he was working but there was no evidence to suggest that it was an entitlement and his reasons why he drew the salaries was that because otherwise he could not survive he needed these monies and one has to apply a very practical approach to this kind of situation your honour because in singapore especially there are very many of such companies and most people who when an incident like this occurs where they are injured they don't think of the legalities involved at that point of time the more pressing needs are raised what do they need for their medical expenses what they need for daily needs not whether he is entitled to draw the salary or not they just carry on they only apply the legalities are only addressed when they subsequently go and consult their solicitors and on that basis your honour my submission is that it cannot be accepted that what he drew as salaries was because he was entitled to now the points have been raised by my learned friend was that because they were family companies he was entitled to draw his salary my submission on that is my lord it should not make any difference whether it was family company or companies which were not owned by him what difference is therefore in such a situation to another situation where he is also a shareholder with several of his friends as shareholders and a similar situation arises and his other directors allow him to continue drawing the salary what are the principles should that situation be distinguished from this situation or they didn't where he just said we are employee where the employer says where he has been a long standing employee and he is injured seriously injured and incapacitated and the employer says never mind we will pay you your salary in the meantime and if and when you get it then we decide whether to repay it back thus i don't see why anybody should discriminate in any of these instances and in fact your honour one of the cases which was cited by the appellants was the case of esso petroleum which is in support of the fact that it is the same company and so that the plaintiff and the company are one and the same that's in the same bundle which one of the issues here was the sum of six thousand two hundred and seventy pounds which was utilized by a family company by the defendant here who was counter-claiming for his loss and the arguments put forward against this claim was that it was not his loss but his private family company's loss because the source of the funds were from that and since the company was not claiming he should not succeed the court found that it was his loss but i would like to refer your honour to all the judgments and the first judgment it should be on page eight hundred and twenty of lord denning sorry not eight hundred and twenty eight hundred and twenty-one your honour at para f in page eight hundred and twenty-one of the report paragraph f where lord denning deals with the loss if i may just read the initial capital of six thousand two hundred and seventy pounds was not provided by mr mathan personally out of his bank account it is no concern of esso where it came from your honour both the court seems to imply that it was his loss at the same time the court also seemed to imply the judge lord denning that he treated it as if that it was the loan from his own private company to him and similarly omrod l j at page eight hundred and thirty of the same report after going into the facts that both mister mathan and the company never kept a proper records and if i may just come to the last line just after paragraph c it would be for mister mathan and the company to arrange their own affairs hereafter implying that though mister mathan may have create treated the company as his own he should put the affairs in order and i would think what he meant was that these monies should go back to the company so they are actually treating these monies which mister mathan received as a loan and that is precisely what the learned trial judge in this case in our case did he treated it as voluntary payments and that is supported on the facts and it is a general rule your honour that voluntary ex gratia payments need not be taken into consideration when the court is assessing loss of earnings and i would like to refer monkmen which is on page nine of my bundle for the general principles it's a white bundle of authorities and if i may just read the three situations which are relevant here if wages of an employee have been made up by the employer the possibility of recovering the full amount without regard to this various according to the circumstance and in english law three cases have to be distinguished and voluntary payment is not to be concept of his loss of earnings cunningham versus harrison and that is exactly the situation here my lord so long as the salaries received or the monies received by the respondent were not as a result of an entitlement under his contracts for service then a court has to need or rather need not take into account these payments for assessing his loss of earnings and in cunningham versus harrison the court there ignored the fact that which is on page ninety-eight of my bundle that the court ignored the fact that the employers had paid the employee an ex gratia payment for life then again in dennis versus london passenger transport board which is on page seventy-six of my bundle here again the plaintiff received as a result of the accident he was not paid the salaries but he received equivalent to the same firm the minister of pensions and from his employers but pension in sick pay which equivalents which amounts together which equaled to his wages and he sued the tort freezer and the court held that the fact that employers or others that paid him should or quite voluntarily paid him should be naught and if i may just quote from paragraph g of the report the cardinal point to remember is that it is the defendants who are responsible for what has occurred in my opinion a wrong doer is not to be allowed to reduce damages by the extend that the other persons have made up to the plaintiff his wages like the london county council versus the ministry of pensions in this case shall be paid back to these bodies out of the sums recovered and this is what the learned trial judge also indicated in his judgment that the plaintiff was under a duty to repay his monies and on the next page in the same bundle your honour is a malaysian case of lim kiat boon which is more in line with the fact situation in our case the plaintiff also my lord your honour in this case was a director of a company on the facts it's not shown whether if he was a shareholder and he was injured and his employers paid him during his incapacity paid the medical bills and also his salary and commissions which he would have earned and in fact the evidence there also was that the employers did not expect the payment at the time they paid the salaries but subsequently they gave evidence that if the court ordered the tort freezer damages then they expect a repayment and similarly at the trial the plaintiff himself give an undertaking to the court to repay these monies if he received it back to the company and on that basis your honour the court held that he was entitled to claim his monies which even though he has been paid by his employers  then if i may referred to page seventy-eight of the bundle your honour on the righthand side sorry not seventy-eight seventy-nine on the lefthand side paragraph f that the court draws a distinction between payment received as of right and voluntary payments earlier on in paragraph e the court cites negregor on damages and says the courts appear never to have taken into account in their assessment of damages for loss of earning capacity monies gratuitously conferred from private sources upon the plaintiff as a mark of sympathy and assistant and this approach is fully supported in barry versus cleaver by the majority and minority alike reads) as of right from their employer either under a tort statutory or contractual obligation the money received is deductible
