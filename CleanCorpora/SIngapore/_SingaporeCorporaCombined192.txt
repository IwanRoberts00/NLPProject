and uh welcome sports fans to the toa payoh swimming the venue of the platform diving for women you're watching magdeline wong doing a her seventh dive uh she's already done uh four this morning and this afternoon they are doing four more dives and uh she took it off from the five metre platform magdeline wong coming in uh in the eighth position uh out of eight girls so far in this platform competition for diving and uh not a very good round of scores for magdeline unfortunately and she may uh still remain in that eighth position and uh with me here is uh toto my co-commentator and perhaps he'd like to give you a run down on this indonesian diver coming up well the ten metre platform is a long way up and uh you're heading the water uh at the probably maximum velocity coming in perhaps around well fifty kilometres per hour and uh it could uh do quite a bit of damage if you don't have a proper entry and next we have a a thai diver bumbrunrob an annong uh she is ranked number four at the moment uh she slipped tow position she ranked second coming in for this afternoon's uh round of dives and now she has dropped two positions to fourth position ann onarnong of thailand on the five metre platform oh not a very good dive and uh i think she's not going to be able to even hold her fourth position with dives like that it's a bit unfortunate if you watch from the slow mo replay uh she didn't really make uh the dive completely and uh she was uh rather sloppy coming in into the entry the uh judging has improved tremendously uh from yesterday i was told that two of the judges that judged yesterday have been removed because of inconsistency in their scoring and as a result of which uh we have a better scoring uh at least better consistency among the diving judges and this is uh masophie of the philippines on the ten metre platform back one and a half somersault and uh that's unfortunately an over spun you know in the straight position it's a bit difficult to do your uh uh spins around and uh the control is vital there and uh it's a bit unfortunate but for masophie scoring only threes and threes and a halves and now we have uh the leader of the pack sowani of thailand back two and a half in a pipe position with a rather high degree of difficulty two point nine from the ten metre platform she nailed that one very very nicely and uh that was the most difficult on her repertoire with the two point nine degree of difficulty and and a little bit problem with the focus with overhead camera but nevertheless you could see that uh she did fairly well and uh she will probably win the gold medal in this uh round of uh platform diving for women very good dive from the myanmar diver and now this is the that all singaporeans uh should uh look out for little pearl wee diving from for singapore uh pearl is a newcomer where diving is concerned she's only started training about a year ago and she's already showing great promise pearl wee from the five metre platform with a handstand dive she's suppose hold it uh well there's no really specific rule but you must hold it in a reasonable time and i suppose the judges uh have agreed that uh it is reasonable and uh a very scores there for pearl wee of singapore that's one name all singaporeans should look out for in the uh diving calendar for the next uh few years and i hope pearl will continue with her diving training and next we have another uh up and coming diver representing singapore magdeline wong and she should do very very well in years to come given proper encouragement magdeline from the five metre platform also doing a handstand dive similar to the one that pearl did and as you watch that replay technically they must hold that handstand for a reasonable period of time to show proper control and uh a fairly good round for magdeline wong another name to watch out for in diving and bonwonroc of thailand in the ten metre board ten metre platform going through her motions in her mind takes a great deal of concentration here inward dive two and a half somersault not a very good entry execution was okay it's only towards a masked?? uh half somersault but uh she quit on the dive and coming up now we have uh obiater masophie of the philippines another arms tand dive with a double somersault in the pipe position masophiw obiater of the philippines yes she should get a six and half there five and a half six and a half points here's that replay there yes about five and a half and six and a half point and now coming up uh i think she'll most probably win the gold medal uh sawani of thailand yes uh unless she's a complete fail dive uh she would uh definitely walk away with the gold medal for thailand another armstand dive double somersault this time in the pipe position good control good entry and uh that definitely will win her the gold medal watch the control there very nicely control and uh jubilation in the thai camp and that was the gold medal dive from uh chuck awana sawani from thailand congratulated by her teammates and officials and overall uh that completes the concludes the platform diving for women the winner as we have said earlier on was uh chuck awana sawani of thailand with uh three hundred and sixty-six point zero five point in second position we have dwee marestuti of indonesia with uh three hundred and forty-seven point eight points and in third position we have uh mikchrome myer solisito of indonesia with three hundred and thirty-one point one five points and uh there is a lull now in the diving uh complex uh as we get ready for the next event and that is the men's platform diving and uh i think this will probably uh start in about uh twenty minutes' time you have the results there uhm the thai girl doing very very well uh leading by easily twenty twenty points from second place uh yes pearl uh finished sixth in her first sea games and uh actually the two girls pearl wee and magdeline wong have done very very well uh considering that uh it's been a long long time since we've had uh uh divers especially lady divers in our diving competition and uh let's hope pearl wee and magdeline wong will continue will their efforts and perhaps in the next sea games they should hopefully win at least a medal in the diving competition and uh as we get ready now for uh the men's uh platform event uhm the divers are uh starting to warm up uh for the event uhm there was a tremendous downpour the heavens opened up over here at toa payoh and uh there's a very very happy diver there and with that we hand you back to caldecott hill for more reports on the seventeenth sea games  yes uh unfortunately for eric boheng uh he was expected to win this race and uh i must say desmond swam a good race unfortunately he could not uh master enough uh power to get a lead in the breaststroke it's very important in the individual medley to get a lead in the breaststroke leg because as you finish your breaststroke and you go on to your freestyle leg your opponent is still swimming a slower breaststroke leg and therefore you can get uh uh an easy lead in him but uh uh unfortunately for desmond he just could not uh get ahead of uh of uh rattapong in in the uh breaststroke leg and rattapong is very strong swimmer uh we watch him swim yesterday and uh rattapong is just far too strong for desmond in the freestyle leg and as you can see rattapong just pull ahead uhm in any case uh it was a good swim for desmond and not to take anything away from rattapong who won the event in two minutes zero six point nine zero seconds uh just barely uh breaking the record by uh four hundredth of a second uhm good swim nevertheless uh desmond has to be content with a silver medal in two minutes eight point nine eight seconds and uh sutanto of indonesia in uh two minutes ten point eight four seconds and there you have the official results flashed on your screen i'm very surprised uh with eric boheng uh expected him to do better and uh coming in last when you're defending champion uh a really uh there's no excuse i i i really don't think there's an excuse for that uh i really don't know what happen but uh for a defending champion to end up uh a wooden spoon in the event is uh uh really i really don't know there there could be uh uh more acceptable reason he just gave up yea but that's not until after tomorrow or day after and now uh as we wait for the uh relay event for the women let's uh go for a commercial break welcome back to toa payoh and uh we now have the start of the four by hundred metres freestyle uh for women singapore is featured in lane number four and the first swimmer for singapore is adeline lim and singapore is in the lead adeline now uh you can see in the middle of your screen there's adeline lim swimming for singapore leading the pack uh coming into the first turn and uh adeline has turned in twenty-eight point six nine seconds following uh closely by indonesia and uh thailand indonesia is represented by katherine masulia and uh thailand is represented by johati terongsawat and even and ng chiang ling is taking off the second position for singapore ng chiang ling has gone up and this is going to be a very exciting race the uh record holder for this event is the team from indonesia established in nineteen ninety-one in the time of four minutes zero point nine zero seconds what a race this is very very close race between the three countries indonesia singapore and thailand and they're neck to neck and it looks like it's thailand slightly singapore with uh singapore in second position and indonesia lying third for the moment and uh taking over for the third leg is may wee for singapore actually it's a very good uh best kept secret so far we didn't even know that jos joscelin is gonna swim the anchor until just a few minutes ago they would not release the uh position of the swimmers and now it's uh may wee who has taken the lead over for singapore singapore in the lead uh with uh indonesia it's thailand in second position and indonesia in third position may wee leading for singapore and it's joscelin yeo singapore's heroine taking on the anchor leg swimming the last one hundred metres in this four by hundred metres freestyle relay for women unless something dreadful happen nobody is gonna catch up with joscelin joscelin is easily leading by

a great race by the four girls uh the four girls represented singapore adeline lim uh ng chiang ling may wee and joscelin yeo yes may wee swam a very very good race and uh that's not taking away from the rest of the girls all of them swam exceedingly well and may wee was the one who uh uh extending the lead for the singapore and uh look at that it's just so happy and uh adeline uh and uh and may
