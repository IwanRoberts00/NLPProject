okay lah you know mondays what's wrong mondays oh well it's after the weekend and ya and i've there's so much work to do i'm doing some word-processing ah what is is all about oh no i'm just typing some you know some work and things like that and then this morning i saw prof in the corridor and i waved to him and i said good morning prof you know in my usual cheerful fashion and then he looked at me at first he didn't recognise me because i'm wearing shorts and then he saw my shorts and he said his eyes open big and he said shorts not allowed not allowed what did you say aw i said but these are bermudas and it's less than eight inches above your knee no i didn't measure isn't it silly oh then you you owe him an explanation then oh i shall i should when i see him i shall now hide behind pillars and not avoid him i'll avoid him when i'm wearing shorts don't worry he's leaving he's leaving in december oh no november that's early i think so but then i mean it will be a nice break for him he said uh that he would be going to china and the i think britain china and britain two opposite ends six months for each countries isn't that nice ya isn't that wonderful i wish we could go away too and envy him ya ya ya ya well you must have some grey hair before you can go for that oh okay i'll go home and take my dye right then who who who do you think is gonna to take over no i think doctor tan doctor tan it's it's not confirmed yet ya usual last time he was acting head when prof was away ya ya talking about china have you been to china oh i went to china in june this year it was quite a good experience and the you know you could tell that china is still fifty years behind time and they have a lot to learn and to you know develop to make the country really uhm what shall i say modern in that sense and the with better facilities particularly their toilets are they using the bucket system no no no they have toilets which are not uh with good facilities for example they have doors which are too low and some of them are without even doors they're just like stables for horses oh did you feel like a mare after sometime we didn't bother we just did it like everybody else but there's segregated toileting i mean toilet facilities for men and women for male and females so you know we didn't feel anything after that you get used to it i think it's a matter of adaptation so we really it it was really an eye-opener and when we came back to singapore we said wow we really appreciate singapore it's a country i want to live that's right ya i suppose a country's ya when you visit it's a different thing if you were to live in it i think you know there'd be a difference there sort of visiting is different but living there is another thing so which parts of china did you go to oh we went to beijing xian wuxi kweilin guangzhou shanghai guangtong and then back to singapore is a dam gonna be built at you know oh yes i think they have already started and this would take about ten years and the beautiful tree goddess might be a bit spoilt because part of it would be spoilt with the you know the big dam there but they think it's necessary because they need the hydroelectric power there are people for and also against it i think it's a national decision ya that's sad ya it's it's supposed to be very beautiful so why don't you go before they build the dam that's true that's true so which which was the part of china you liked best i love kweilin ha kweilin the remote parts i don't like shanghai and guangzhou because they're too crowded and cramped and the air is polluted and oh it's just like a it's it's another concrete jungle uhm ya i suppose too similar to singapore uh and hong kong now and people are there people there are very materialistic they just make money money money money regardless this it's getting quite bad in shanghai and the there're heads and heads and heads everywhere you go just you see people people people everywhere ya i was in hong kong last year oh you did so uh ya it was very uh interesting i like the street activity i walked a lot you know along the streets and the architecture is quite dynamic went into the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation very exciting space oh how long were you in hong kong oh only a week about a week is that all ya did your family or the family went no no i went on a conference kind of thing oh did you present a paper there no no last year i didn't i just attended a conference i'm sure you enjoyed it oh yes i enjoyed it and then the people i met at the conference were very kind and welcoming and then i met this lady an english woman who lived in macau and when she invited me to stay with her and i did good good good did you speak cantonese while you were there no i didn't i you spoke english i'm afraid lei sek kong kong fu wah ker ma ng sek ker bai yen lau ker lor wor ya i i i used my cantonese and then i tried to direct this driver to this you know this place and uh i mispronounce and then he couldn't understand the hong kong people can be very sharp with their tongues ya i was quite fortunate those people i met i you know i'd you know were quite kind really ya the hong kong people i met were quite kind well you you must have met the the good people yes i didn't go on shopping sprees 'cause shopping isn't my  word so but there was some huge shopping centres you know and i i don't like to go to shopping centres really so macau was very charming i went to the maritime museum spent a lot of hours there you know it was beautiful so beautiful exhibits and lovely location you can see macau you can see china from macau i heard that but did you see no i didn't i heard there's this hill ya that you can see just right into chinese village you know just look across the sea and that's china you have been to macau yes i went sometime ago it was many years ago i still have a auntie there do you know what happen to her she she really ran away from china to macau when it was hard you know in china so it was uh a time when many people were trying to run away and some succeeded and some did not succeed some were killed some died while escaping you know that was very terrible so what's she how old is she now oh she's about sixty plus her children are all grown-up her husband is about seventy plus well he's a painter she married an artist she married in in in in in macau no she met him or she they were married they were in singapore you know in those days they were so they were chi they are chinese-educated and they were so pro china that time so they wanted to get to china so they left singapore to go to china i'm sure they regretted but then what to do they made a decision but it was hard life it was a time when mao tsi-tung just took over can you imagine the time where they took over was harsh and the country was poor and it was just work work work work work and no play so oh she had a hard life but she does come back once in a while to see her sisters and brothers here ya that's pretty unusual ya ya so when i see people doing that you know it makes you think that you're really lucky to be in singapore you have everything you need and it's peaceful here and you have at least we don't have hundred per cent freedom you know but you you still do a lot of things the things that you love to do you can do right ya i think ya basic safety is quite important yes well i suppose you know people the basic right to be able to walk safely on the streets at night yes i met a number of foreigners and they said oh singapore is just beautiful you can you feel so safe on the road even at eleven p m and they say i won't dare to do this in my own country and this is not a normal they say it's not normal to feel so safe in a country singapore is really extraordinary you can go to cairo saudi arabia and any part of europe you know you don't feel so safe especially america and new york even in have you been to new york ya i didn't go to new york but i just went there to catch a plane but i was all the time with friends so i was very sort of looked after but on my own i won't i don't think i would dare to travel you know in of course there're certain alleys and places you should not go to yes you must know where to go so you must know the places that's right nothing like your home home sweet home ah well yes yes so do you think you would be travelling uh this long vacation which is in october ya i hope to take vacation because i got a lot of leave to clear you have forty-two days have you taken any days leave oh i took a little bit last year just a few days but i i have a lot to clear before next year so i should maximise you know the holiday and really take a break i think i need it then you can't accumulate for too long no you can't carry forward for one or two years i think two years maximum i did ask christine and said not two years i think it's fair otherwise if you accumulate you get uh practical eighty-four days what are you gonna do with eighty-four days i don't want to carry oh i would love to go away for eighty-four days eighty-four days but i don't think university can spare well run will be maybe two months three two and a half three months ya i would rather have more frequent breaks and i can relax my mind rather than have a long you know break and you feel sometimes it can feel bored with too long a break don't you i don't know i'm i always find things to do oh because your children are there waiting for mummy to take her leave yes during their vacation time yesterday i went to a wedding dinner at the changi golf club oh beautiful area you know and apparently this restaurant is opened to the public i didn't know that i thought was only was it was it an open air restaurant no no but it had lovely high ceilings and it was facing the sea and the islands and then my my my friend i mean it was his wedding dinner and then he had only two tables of close friends you know and then he said oh look at that island  have you been to this island it's called wuming island island without a name i said no i haven't been wuming oh have you heard of it is it pulau tekong in singapore is it pulau tekong cause i said i i pulau pulau tekong is still pulau tekong ya he said wuming and then i said wuming sounds so chinese ya maybe then i said no i haven't been to that island i didn't know it had that name that means it had no name anyway i i had i tried to excuse myself by saying i had always been bad in geography blame your geography teacher oh yes i have nightmares about my geography test still do you know what happen to me when i was sitting for an o level i never liked history because of the teacher she really killed my interest in history and as a result i had f nine for history but i could afford to fail in that in that subject because i had extra subjects so i concentrated in my other subjects and i just didn't bother about history i just hated it so a teacher is so important in the sense that they can motivate you or really kill your interest that's true that's why i mean we as teachers here too you know it's it's really important how we how we teach the student and you know it's not so much well what we say is important too but really how we transmit that knowledge yes my students my science students are telling me that some of the now i know the teachers that they have are not the excellent teachers you know they they are good in their own field but they they don't know how to to communicate their knowledge to their students and to to be a you know to be a good researcher for example it's quite different from being a good teacher and most of them they say are boring in the sense that they only know how to explain how to get the solution or the answer on the blackboard and nothing else because it they they won't bother to crack a joke with you or say anything more besides how to get the answer or a formula ya and i think and the the technique the pedagogy you know the the teaching technique is quite weak they are they're over using transparencies the overhead projector and they're making love to the transparencies you know they really look you know they don't there's no eye contact with the students no question or answer time and it's you know it's a some of them mumble to themselves and are really bad i know and uh i i think i read somewhere that there are workshops organised for uh lecturers or tutors who have had no teaching skills as such no we have something here in the university the you know we have a pre you know before we start i went did you go for that i attended one on uh tutorial strategies just you know a few weeks ago it was quite good not that one i think all new expatriate staff who come in they are supposed to go for this briefing i mean this uh brief course and how to cope with students you know in the singapore context because in tutorials i think you know our students are very quiet here they they they very shy they feel very inadequate and rather intimidated so they tend not to speak not to ask questions and you know it becomes more like a class session whether they they expect the lecturer to speak and to give them answers to questions i think most of them are very passive even the when our students go abroad you see the the the difference between our asian students compared to those you know caucasians they would talk talk talk but sometime it can be empty talk but they will still talk ya that's what they call hogging air space
