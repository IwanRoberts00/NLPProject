okay now in the previous many lectures and we concern ourselves with the the
movement of solute in a single phase only
""
we say how would the solute be transported from the bulk solution or
bulk  word  to the interface or to the place where it ends
""
we never said anything about what happen after that so we only
concentrate ourselves with one single phase but mass transfer processes
always involve some you know significant changes to the solute that you have
so actually we have normally in in chemical  word  system
multiphases and we can only consider a cup a two phases at a time how the
solute move from one place to the other
""
now for each phase involved there is what we have assumed the film
theory and this film theory imply that the transport of molecule from the
bulk into the uh to the interface or to the place where the two phases
separate and we assume by the film theory that the major draught
concentration draught or the major change in the concentration within the
phase is confined to a single film and that's why we call it the film theory
right
""
and uh we relate this to our diffusivility and from there we relate
to what we call a term call mass transfer coefficient
""
now today we are going to continue with this and say how when this
solute is then is brought to the interface separating the two phases what
happen after that
""
will the solute go into the second phase and if it goes into a
second phase what happen
""
that's one thing second thing is what happen at the interface okay
""
now for this interface mass transfer it relates to as i said to many
many different chemical engineering processes
""
let's take for example the gas liquid system now here we are
concerned with a particular solute in this gas and in the liquid mixture
""
now we have a gas containing a solute which we want to remove using
a solution in other words we want to the solute from the gas to go into the
solution
""
we have what we call absorption a-p okay a-b
""
now here the ab and ad are two different thing and this actually is
is subscripts of not subscript what the word called pre prefix of a english
word stemmed from latin roots uh
""
ab means by ad means two so here ab absorption is the solute from
the gas is absorbed by the liquid by the liquid whereas in the third case
where liquid-solid we have adsorption gas-solid too i forgot to put the one
""
i should not put the liquid there i should put a uh fluid fluid
solid system will be an adsorption
""
adsorption means the solute is being taken onto the surface of the
solids okay
""
now this gas liquid if we have a liquid and we boil it up or even
not boiling we if the uh if the gas phase that is in contact with the content
less solute at equilibrium with the liquid then the solute in the liquid will
then come out we transfer from the bulk uh liquid into the to the interphase
and from interphase out into the gas phase
""
now liquid liquid liquid liquid here we if we have to have a
interface we must have immissible liquid in other words the liquid cannot mix
each other so they become two phases and they are both in liquid state
""
now here we have what we call in motion invisible liquid solid a
movement
""
now here we have relate to our processes call the extractive
processes solvent extraction which i think i don't think you have done any
experiment in that that will be in third year so solvent extraction
""
so liquid solid we have absorption dissolution in other word the
solid the solute in the solid will then dissolve in a liquid okay
""
now very important concept here is mass transfer will only occur if
that is a departure from equilibrium whether it is in a singlephase or
cross-phases okay
""
now in a gas phase or in a vapour phase we can describe our
composition in terms of y-a which is the the uh ratio of the partial pressure
of a divided by the total pressure that is given by dalton dalton's law and
he says summation of this partial pressure is equal to total pressure that's
what we can find the composition in that way and this will be molar
composition
""
and dalton russ which rasult says that it is a simple relationship
to the solute concentration in the other  word  in a
liquid phase
""
so in p-a partial pressure is equal to y-a-p over x-a
""
now this is ideal system
""
now non-ideal system of course we have i think in term of dynamics
you already study about this activities
""
you cannot use x-a you must use activities and activities of course
related to the activity coefficient and so on
""
now henry's law henry's law is strictly is a very special case is
strictly apply to only dilute solution or to solution which contains very
sparingly soluble solute so so that the partial pressure is directly
proportional to the concentration of the solute
""
now this the second two relationship with dalton raoult's and
henry's law describes the equilibrium relationship between the solute in a
liquid and a solid in a gas phase okay
""
now this is for the gas liquid
""
now for the liquid liquid i just put the example for the gas liquid
here for the liquid liquid same thing happens except that x-a and y-a are now
referring to the two liquid phases okay and this is what we call liquid
liquid equilibrium relationship but they are not governed by the same law
""
now the solid liquid the solid fluid now you have heard about
adsorption you have heard about adsorption isotherm
""
the adsorption isotherm is a equilibrium relating the solute in a
fluid and a solute absorbed onto the solid okay so that is the demure
""
you have done that haven't you in your thermodynamics
""
no
""
demure fixed law
""
so those are the fluid solid equilibrium
""
don't be so stern
""
don't worry about  word 
""
now that part when you translate you have to remove this
""
they look they look so tense normally they are not like that your
influence
""
normally they were laughing and smiling okay anyway
""
so now we've come back to this the relationship now you must have
wonder why did i talk about equilibrium
""
now if you have a transfer from one place to another definitely
there must be some relationship between the two phases and since you have a
interface that equilibrium relationship most probably i say first most
probably occur at the interface
""
now through research and all it has establish that no matter what
happen at interface at interface the composition of one phase is invariably
in equilibrium with the second phase at the interface
""
now there's some work long time ago regarding this phenomena and
there's one research worker claim that there's certain departure
""
he call it the kinetic molecular departure but then the departure
is so small that for all purpose and intention we say that it is at
equilibrium and this make life very easy for design engineers okay
""
now with that let's look at the composition diagram for the
different model
""
now we join the liquid the the film theory for one single phase and
since now we have two phases
""
we have two film so we call this as two film model and this is
first proposed by lewis and whitman
""
each film is describe by the film theory regarding the transport of
the solute from the bulk to the interface
""
this is the  word  separating the two phases and
the other one the phase two is sort of described by similar ways and this is
our concentration profile
""
now here we find that the diagram there depicts the movement of a
from the gas phase to the liquid phase and c-a-i p-a-i are the composition
relating to the two phases at the interface and  word 
that they are related through the equilibrium relationship no matter whether
it's liquid liquid system solid fluid system or gas liquid system okay each
one has its own type of equilibrium relationship
""
now this conceptually p-a-i is not exactly sitting on the interface
okay it's a little bit removed from interface it is the partial pressure of a
at the interface just floating above the interface and the concentration
c-a-i is just immediately in the liquid phase at the boundary condition at
the boundary itself and together they maintain that relationship
""
so the the uh rate of transfer from the bulk of the of phase one to
the interface is then described by this concentration jug within the film
itself and it moves into the liquid phase after it has gone into the liquid
phase or into the phase two
""
now if phase two is liquid a when get from the gas into the liquid
phase has to become a liquid state  word 
""
now that becomes that join into the a in the liquid phase or in the
phase two and then you move into the bulk solution
""
now if the gas phase and the liquid phase are in motion and in
constant motion and if p-a-g and c-a-l are constant in other word it is a
dynamic system if they are constant then there will be a steady state whereby
the rate of movement in the gas phase will then be equal to the rate of
movement in the liquid phase
""
now which is not a dynamic system
""
if it is just a batch system let's say you bubble gas into a liquid
station and uh liquid which is stirred but then the liquid is not moving nor
out of the system itself then the bulk concentration of the gas will decrease
because more and more being absorbed into the liquid and then the liquid
concentration through this absorption will then increases and there will come
a time when the bulk solution will then appear together at the equilibrium
concentration and the gas phase we were saying decrease to a concentration
and this will then be at equilibrium in other words the whole system is at
equilibrium there is no net transfer that is only for a batch system
""
so a batch system that movement is transient state
""
at steady state it is at equilibrium okay the gas concentration the
solid concentration the gas phase because now there's no movement the bulk
and interface and the film will be the same so that concentration will then
be at equilibrium with the liquid concentration
""
now in chemical engineering processes we are dealing mostly with
steady state phenomena so this particular case illustrated here is of imp of
importance
""
so here now we say n-a-z that's the amount of a transfer in phase
one is related to k-g times p-a-g minus p-a-i
""
now this k-g as we said it is a mass transfer coefficient
""
now the unit n-a will depends on how you define k-g alright
""
if you define k-g based on the unit per square area then n-a will
be  word  per second per metre square in s-i unit
""
okay p-a of course it is impartial pressure so your k-a must
convert that partial pressure into the  word  of places
right
""
so here your units are very important
""
now for phase two similarly we have k-l c-a-i minus c-a-l
""
now k-l is the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase
""
now sometime we use the word film on top of it partly to identify
that this relates to a special phase itself to phase one to phase two so
usually we says film mass transfer coefficient
""
later on you know why we have to use the word film to differentiate
from what we call the overall mass transfer coefficient 
""
now this is no different from your heat transfer lecture given by
dr neo right we have our individual film transfer coefficient and later on we
have our overall film transfer coefficent now this diagram here illustrate
the equilibrium relationship between the two phases relating to this
particular solute a and this eq the equilibrium curve this arbitrary it can
be described by a given equilibrium relationship if it is described by
henry's law then that is not a  word  relationship it is a
linear relationship okay now here we can see that at the interface the
composition is represented on the equilibrium curve and if you look at this
the slope of this line joining the p-a-g and c-a-l that particular point in
other word it describe the bulk concentration to the interface composition
that slope is given by minus k-l over k-g it's a ratio of the two mass
transfer coefficient now this are not dimensionless ah the slope is not
dimensionless because k-l and k-g has different dimension depending on how
you what is the concentration uh composition you are using here we are using
partial pressure and molar concentration now if you change both of this
relationship to molar composition then it is dimensionless otherwise it is
not okay
