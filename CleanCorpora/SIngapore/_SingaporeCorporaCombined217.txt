good afternoon everyone uhm you will have seen quite a few things on that video and if you noticed you know as you listen to to me and if you even look at the little advertising brochure there's a lot of focus about doing something worthwhile to your lives and you sort of look at it and you can go my god am i suppose to be a saint you know is this some sort of a profession where you have to have a little lobe to your head and you got to be into a calling uhm from one point of view you know that's often a way teaching is considered you sort of look at it and you sort of think that uhm from a very altruistic point of view you're taking care of other people and well i work with seventeen and eighteen year olds uhm which is not far away from your age i suppose and really it is that because you know when you first start out when i started out and in nie you don't really think that you're going to be doing much except imparting knowledge that you're going to tell someone about something else and that's that but you know once start you find to your horror really and you're not just doing that you become in the course of time a lot of other little surrogate things you become a surrogate you know you sort of get all the problems nobody wants to tell their par parents so they sort of bring it along to you or you get you know surrogate girlfriend or boyfriend as well they sort of use you as his prop they try out their lines before they go and attempt to engage with other people so you know it's a lot of things which focus your attention on other people so from that point of view where is it you know word  uses the catch phrase about doing something worthwhile with your life yes there is a relevance to it there is a meaning to it because you are forever working with other people and that's where i like to start with by telling you if you want to ask yourself why teach ask yourself this question do you like people can you stand noise would you like your life to be in a state of turmoil at times and would you like difference if your answers to this sort of things are yes then you're on your way to finding out what is there in the teaching profession now you know the sort of images you had there on the video screen about you know where you can do all sorts of little different things it's perfectly true yes i'm not denying the fact that no one will be a teacher and anyone who sat in a classroom can't deny the fact there's the boring mundane stuff to do there's the timetable that everybody follows and everybody hates there's marking that the teacher does look at at anyone of us straight in the eye and ask us whether we like the marking we'll look at you and say is the moon made up of blue cheese no we all made the stuff so we do it anyway but i can look at you and say from a counter perspective are you really thinking that anywhere in any job in any country that there is not going to be something which is routine routines are there it's part of life but i'm telling you that while the paper work routine might be there in the teaching profession there is one thing that will always change now if you're a banker your central consideration is not so much at least from my point of view it's not so much the person in front of you it's that sheet of figures in front of you it's that thing the figures and whether or not it's going to balance whether or not at the end of the day everything is going to come out in picture perfect on paper so you're working with people but only as a by-product not as a direct and in front of you let me take another example now let's say you were a doctor you could say that just as altruistic as being a teacher is it worthwhile staying away you can't look at anyone and deny it's not worthwhile but again you know people are there but you're more interested in their in their insides the bits that you want to cut out not living and they're not looking at them at least from my point of view i think you're looking more in them for things again they're there but they're a by-product because you're focussed on something else but when you're teaching there's no way you're going to avoid one thing there's is going to be a person in fact if you teach in a secondary school up to thirty-five of them you teach in a junior college fifteen to twenty-five they're going to be there they're going to be staring at you and they're be all looking at you wondering so what you you're going to do with us today but we don't want to do anything that's the hard realities of life and you'll never run away with the fact there is a person there and you would have to communicate with that person now that to me is the call of teaching because you're a people and no one person is the same as the next and that makes it so highly flexible so highly different now you will find out most of us especially those of us who teach english chatter on forever simply because we collect stories of students and it gets terribly boring because we have stories about who to go up to whom and who did where to what but that's our problem you see we are with people all the time and you know if you look around and ask some people why they stay in the profession when they're been in it for thirty forty years they'll tell you because of people and because the fact when you're with someone else you can't be selfish you got to forever look out look at other people and in looking at them i can tell you you learn something by yourself as well you'll learn to grow because from another point of view i could say this teaching is not just a noble profession the highly self-indulgent profession cause you could sit there now if you ever wanted to be power crazy this is your ideal chance you have people at your mercy and there are many new things that can be done and only things that limit you are your imagination so you know i can i can take a really humerous point of view and say that many teachers me included we're all probably self-indulgent you know that's the truth of it but from another point of view it's also self word  i beg your pardon it's in your self-interest because you are never going to be static as a teacher you just can't be there's no two situation which is the same yes the books for instance in my in my particular area the books i teach might be the same but no two people react to the same thing in the same manner so you know in that way it's different i can give you an example now in the college i work in we do what's call the fun-o-rama or a fun fair every two years it's great fun and we all say yes you know yes this year there won't be trouble we will have good fun uh but if we get every year there is a new set of people so one year we have a peaceful time everything gets set up and you sort of walk around you'll be like a middle manager you know the real professional type all you have to do is walk around and check and say oh it's going well isn't that nice that was fine and the next year went round screw up the gas canister real fire going so you see it's just of variety all the time and that kind of variety carries over into the way you teach someone now i would think what uhm what the speaker said on the video is very very accurate this is the one profession where your mind will continue to grow intellectually you can't just say well i was train as a heart i train in psychology or something else or history but now i work somewhere else doing something which is nothing to do with my degree god word i really like teaching it's always to be something directly relevant to a degree in front of you i bet that you're going to grow as well so from one point of view teaching's ideal for anybody doesn't want a quiet back word who wants that to have a little bit more of excitement but not the kind of excitement that revolves only around making money it you know i'm not saying that you can't get rich in teaching it's a stable job honest and you know the pay scales are good comparative to some place in in the private sector right can't deny but even if you found your own doe you don't keep up you do the other things because you gain in a personal way which you may not do if you just push paper now if you ask me which is the part i like the most about the teaching i would say the people i would meet i'm always meet the people and the fact that they keep coming back to you you know if they start out as your students especially when you were seventeen and eighteen and that age group they start as your students if you're lucky they become your friends and that's the best part of it so you think about it in this point of view would you really want to turn down a job where one you can grow intellectually two there's always difference three you're constantly meeting new people and making friends if these three things are going to be important as a matter of your life have this with the profession that should have your vision so please think about it  good evening again good afternoon rather still afternoon okay right let me first go through the course that you would be doing in nie dr chen has mentioned to you and has given you the core structure just to familiarise yourself with terminologies i like to go through the types of the course and the duration and what you need to have the basic requirements okay firstly you have the postgraduate diploma in education in secondary whenever the term secondary is mentioned it includes jc okay this course is for equips you to put all the skills pedagogical skills to teach in secondary jc levels okay the first programme which is academic only it's a nine-month okay and you enter into july and you finish off in the following march with your exams then you go to schools to teach okay and for this you need to have a degree from a university in at least two teaching subjects this is what miss charlotte beck has been telling you two teaching subjects is essential and you know in secondary schools most of the teachers would teach two okay in jc you may specialise in one subject okay and most of our jc teachers are people with honours degree so if you want just trying word to teach at jc and nothing you must have honours there are some without honours degree but that's the exception rather than the rule alright  now the next type of programme for secondary is pgde postgraduate diploma in education with pe specialisation okay some of you are very sports incline you're very sporty uhm some of the men are as well okay you can apply to teach too for this course to be trained in the pgde secondary with pe it's one year and nine months an extra year this is because at the moment in nus we do not have nus or ntu we do not have a degree in pe
