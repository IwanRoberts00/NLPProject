anymore people coming in uhm where should we start today now from the from novel to stage uh from novel to stage uhm uh let me just say first that i have i've had only one experience of doing this so you know i'm an authority as such uh because i don't spend my whole uh theatre career translating or tra transforming i use the word the term translating books into plays alright uh very often uh i i i start my work from a from a playwright's work or uh just from the actors uh in fact i very seldom uh uh write stuff myself even when i translate from a novel to to stage from book to a stage the one experience i had i worked primarily with actors to create this experience okay uhm what do you all think is the primarily difference between a novel or a book and a stage any volunteers because once we understand the difference we'll be able to zero in on what exactly uhm we have to do in in this translation right let's look at those uh points uhm i think that straight away one of the one of the uh the the first speaker talked about uh the fact that in uh uh in a in a performance okay i would say that the novel the primary difference first of all is that novel is a written piece of work it's text while stage of course is performance uh we're we're not talking about about translating from a a novel into a into a play we're trans for trans for talking about translation from novel into the stage which which means performance and uh immediately it involves an audience i mean you don't get a situation of of three hundred and sixty people reading from one giant book right i mean reading is a very private experience in a sense that it's a one-to-one relationship with the with the book uh while in a in a theatre you have to think about the audience uhm and about the communion between what's happening on stage and what's happening in the audience okay the the the the the reason why i use the word communion is that it's important to relate to the audience it's not it's not going to be uh enough of a threatrical experience if the actor son stage uh uh uh only relating to themselves and there's nothing no no energy flowing out towards the audience while in a sense for a book it's very different i mean the novelist writes the book and he doesn't have to have any potent energy jumping up from the book uh into into the reader's uh uh uh uh into into the reader's feel/field as such so immediately we come to one main difference in that theatre has to have a dynamism okay the stage has to have a dynamism that means that it cannot be a a a uhm a an experience of just of just uh uh imbibing the atmosphere it has to be a three dimensional experience uh which is immediately another difference between the book which is two dimensional and theatre which is three dimensional because you have uh uh the actors you have the three dimensional sets etcetera etcetera uhm one of you brought up also that it's about it's not just not about thoughts it's also about action okay a primary definition of theatre uh in the olden times okay uh the the uh uh from the greek times is that it only needs three elements fro theatre one is that you need a a a a space okay and uh by a space what is define as space you can just use a chalk to draw up a square on a floor and that is your performance space two you need actors uh uh uh with finally three a conflict okay so you need actors uh relating in terms of actions and number three you need a conflict between the actors okay that's all you need to create a play so you can just have a situation where man a meets man b in a space and uh uh they have uh uh different views about life and from there the clash you know develops and then a piece of theatre can happen okay uh and so in a sense theatre is about action and not just about thoughts theatre is a is a is a playing out of thoughts uhm and the the the the key word the third key word there conflict also relates to dynamism because you can only by dynamic when there is a conflict right okay uh do you understand what i mean by dynamism meaning that uh you can't really have a a a play in which nothing happens i mean you can of course i mean that's that's an experimental well because i myself have done something like that where where nothing really happens backette?? for example okay where nothing really happens uh but within that silence or within the emptiness something is happening that means that you're you're you're you're looking at at uh uh an action happening within space zero or time zero okay uhm and going back to the the the term dynamism and conflict uhm we cannot simply in a sense have people sitting on stage unless you're interested in looking at spatial arrangements and lights and bodies moving in the light that means it becomes a kind of kind of dance ritual or movement ritual okay right while in a book like in thomas hardy famous for pages and pages of scenic description appear on the countryside but you can't really do that in uh uh uh on stage because there isn't any dynamism alright you can you you you can create that panorama of scenery in a film for example and word with with music you know it can be a a a a a a wondrous experience like for example uh uh merchant  word ivory's word films uh it's it's very much that he always rolls as to pan his camera through the the countryside and then there is music and you and you and the au the the the the film goer is left to the sense of what just happen in that last scene in a sense you you you have time to to view the scenery and almost look at the last scene happening between vanessa redgrave and uh uh and whoever uh in a diff different perspective okay but in in theatre it's very very difficult because it's life and so if you actually do uh uh uh moments like that you're going to start to have a restless audience or pockets of restlessness uh happening okay so uh we're talking about dynamism we're talking about conflict we're talking about action uhm and uh in relation to what some of you some of the rest of you brought about soliloquies uh well in in film also you can also have a soliloquy you can have a voice over like in uh uh the translation of tennesse william's uh play into the movie i think john malkerwech?? was talking all the time as the as the brother and he was he was having a solliloquy while uh uh the the movie was moving on okay uhm and also in a in in a book you you also have solliloquies happening because it's a personal uh it's a personal impression of let's say what happened in in cornwall alright or in the uh in in the devonshire alright and he's writing the whole chapter so that's already a kind of solliloquy uhm it's that clear up to this point okay now the theatre being a visual experience okay that's that's uh uh uh extremely important because in yesterday's session with with the the the secondary students i talked about the uh uh uh key words of immediacy the magic of the moment okay that theatre is all about immediacy you must have something happening there and then the emotion must be real the emotion must be true and it cannot be it cannot be something which you can cut and refilm alright so you must have the immediacy and the magic of the moment and hence theatre must be vivid it it's a whole immediate moment where as the audience who sit there and you you either washed over with emotions which are so powferable?? because of what's happening on stage between two characters or you're washed over by the visual experience okay it's so theatre or stage is an experiential uh uh uh experience it's it's it's exactly that you see while in a sense and is of all senses it's it's the play touching all senses sight sound uh sometimes you may have incense in a in a small black box smell uh uh uh uh uh uh all your senses all being stimulated while in a in a book it's different okay uhm we walked some of you talked as well about how uh between a book uh and also a a stage experience there is personal space for the for the audience member what do i mean by personal space meaning that when you read the book you can make your you you can sort of stop reading for a while and just close your eyes and imagine what's happening in a chapter uh but you can also do that in a theatre experience in a sense that you make up your mind as to what's happening on stage uh but there are many plays like some of the plays that i do which are extremely aggressive that means there's no time for you to for you the audience to uh to stop and uh and reflect but you're you're constantly pounded by what's happening on stage but a theatre experience can also be such that the director designs it such that there is space for the audience to breathe and to think about what has happen okay alright uh anyone else brought up points which is not address yes of course that if you're a writer who's very concerned that your every word every feeling must be exact then i recommend that you write a novel instead of a play because uh the the primary creation okay this is a this is a a a an old view okay and i'm i'm just talking about the the the old view the primary creative of drama comes from the writer and the secondary creativity comes from the director and actor alright so that if you are very very uh uh jealous about your work you mustn't write a play because finally the play goes to a group of people who work on your text as a basic starting point so what you may have intented is transformed uh into something else alright okay because there are many ways of uh of of of looking at it i mean a director and a group of actors can say that yes i am keeping to the playwright's intention but within this specific moment i can interpret action a instead of action b and still be within the playwright's intention okay alright do you all understand what i am saying that once you write a play you have other elements coming in because the the actors are not machines they're not robots they're not programmed to think like you you may have intended a a a certain motivation to result in a certain action but uh the actor can reach that action with a different motivation because they're not robots and they're not programmed by you while in a novel you can do exactly that because no one else is going touch your your your your book once it's printed as a novel everyone reads it as it is right while once a play is printed that's only part of the process
