oath oh under oath those wear black one is it yanamamo word  how much are you selling for a bottle three fifty uhm three fifty i think quite reasonable price at least for fifteen fifteen bottles onwards word uhm so you should be making hundred percent hundred percent ya what five bottles get the your margin is oh fifty percent uh  uhm that's that is if we that is if you no margin is more hit the target my cost price is only a dollar oh the margin for a dollar is 'a' but you're talking about my margin is two fifty you're selling thirty odd thirty bottles right ya fifteen is breakeven ya that means the other fifteen is pure profit what ya lah word  so fifty percent what ya lah fifty percent nuh fifty percent margin nuh have you calculated your bottles and your rental those uh ya ya everything hah come on lah bizad how would i know i was raking my brains how to call it how to calculate a breakeven point 'a' go use your contribution margin and calculate that's the right way you know ya then put in the fixed cost plus the variable cost ya and plus the x-factor which is all my you know those uh label lah time time and all the gas your labour must be very expensive costed in also i'm sure not right huh i costed in labour too ya about twenty twenty twenty cents extra lah that means the actual raw material is only about eighty cents only
