to rafi back to malek good play by singapore here they're knocking the ball around very quickly very well rafi oh he's right through it almost everybody rafi ali a brilliant solo run there by rafi and he just shocked us by  word  could have been a striking goal tonight the sabah defender just stood there and allowed rafi to run up there and while he did so well to bring in the ball all the way to the penalty box before losing it that came in the third minute of play almost an early lead for singapore oh with me tonight is garetth nicolee and uh garetth your views on tonight's game and singapore's recent slump abdul malek his first touch of the ball and his counterpart in the sabah goal natalika hasn't had one yet but the singapore boys are dominating the early proceedings in the national stadium good ball once again by malek nazri kannan measured that one perfectly and a beautiful pass as well to rafi and he almost repeated his performance last week in sabah where he got his first goal for the national team good cross by k kannan just a word from header from this guy rafi ali and going by the early proceedings here it's all systems go from this man he's instructed his boys to go all the way out for victory tonight and that's what they're doing at the moment the singapore players certainly piling on the pressure good jump by abdul bohan he won that one perfectly well devaraj poor first touch almost let him down but he's still in possession of the ball he gets it back just as quickly as he lost it down to nazri good ball by v devaraj and it took a good tackling job there by uh number eighteen charles tindy to deny nazri nasir a closer look at the byline and an easier cross into the penalty box so the first corner of the match going to singapore with only five minutes of play gone by garusla nicolich or natolika that's right natolika he's got some work to do now a short one a good one too between devaraj and nazri the cross not very good it's definitely yaruslav's ball decides to give it up pump up front devaraj offside vikay s nair from johore a familiar face right here at the national stadium he's officiated so many matches and uh it's abdullah bohan probably an early casualty here these early moments of the match can prove to be so very crucial as the last few home matches have shown singapore have conceded the early goal they've gone on to concede another one and uh a little later on gone on to lose their last two home matches as well against johore and kuala lumpur respectively sabah on the attack now a look at goal for abdullah ardi but he was too hasty in taking the shot and it goes out for a goal kick to singapore good header only as far as papanathan though and here come the singapore team obstruction on the path of abdullah bohan that's rozali zilin the skipper in the sabah team tonight he's a very hardworking mid-fielder in fact it's from him that all the passes come from for their goals this season so far and mind you sabah have been uh having a good streak in the league they've had four victories and they're somewhere in mid-table planning to add to the victories again tonight at the national stadium they have a chance here norhalis shafik he had nowhere to go vitaslav once again closely marked by amin nazsir poor ball control there it's uh charles tindy throw in quickly taken by nazri nasir a different atmosphere and a different ground surely from the one they played last week in uh kota kinabalu kannan oh look quick play by k kannan wonderful stop here by kannan gochiramun oh he decided to be a little bit too unselfish there he should have taken a putt shot at goal k kannan but he decided to give it a cross and it's offside on the path of d devaraj nine minutes of play gone by singapore dominating but once again leaving their scoring boots at leaving at the early stages of this match so far they're playing with some intensity at least and some vigour that's what the fans have come here to see abdullah bohan getting to the ball before his opponents but he uh he has fails to keep it in play pushing it out for a throw in for sabah and we can see the sabah players creeping in slowly but surely into the game now that's where the danger lies because the singapore players are allowing the sabah players too many too much time to settle on the ball good ball once again by k kannan well shut out that time matu simbowi abdullah ardi henry anjun abdullah ardi this is good football by sabah well broken up to by nazri nasir he put his foot in at the right time once again the strikers from not getting their services and uh that's what we've been witnessing in our last two matches the strikers not getting the services from their mid-fielders it is not allowed to be freed around the uh touch line there abdullah boran who uh hastily came back and had to kick the ball out for a throw in to sabah they're getting nearer and nearer and uh everybody in the league this season knows that the singapore defence have been suspect all season round a lot of teams have been finding loopholes again and again can sabah find another one good job by amin nasir good ball up by nazri to rafi good header down well head well kicked out though by matu simbowi once again matu sim to the ball before devaraj malek superb header by malek kawak you wouldn't expect him to win that one but he was way up before his opponent matu simbowi looking once again for vitaslav upfront but he was denied the ball so it's still goaless between singapore and sabah twelve minutes of play gone by singapore have had one good effort at goal where rafi ali just missed time his header after a good cross from uh k kannan in fact from the early proceedings we see that k kannan is certainly suited for this attacking mid-fielder's role oh a slip up there early morning rain at the national stadium doing some uh a little bit hazardous on the player's part then matu sim this is yanu midle midleslav they've retained him from last season yanu in fact they've retained almost all of last season's foreigners except for michael vana who has come over to singapore mutu sim once again the build up very sure very steady very easy from the back they get a free kick from a very dangerous position now norhalis shafik the offender and sabah have a chance now to take the early lead yuroslav midleslav and razali zilin behind this ball and it looks like it's midleslav to take it no it's vitaslav who steps up oh he cracks the crossbar and sabah had scored so as the old word goes soccer is no use without their goals and sabah have prove it again bobby chua has repeated his one goal performance in kota kinabalu by being the first to latch onto that rebounds of the cross bar after a brilliant free kick tuma vitaslav and after dominating for long periods in the opening thirteen minutes singapore have conceded another goal at the national stadium this time to bobby chua there he is lerking and pouncing it must certainly be depressing for the singapore players but that's the way it goes we need the goals not the domination to win matches once again the sabah defence is so very well marshalled tonight by yanu midleslav he's taking the free kick now he's doing a very good job in uh controlling his players and they've caught singapore offside for the fourth time already in the opening stages vitaslav almost setting it up for henry anjun and uh it's from this guy norhalis shafik where the first goal came from of course gave away the free kick nazri kannan back to nazri good ball inside by nazri nasir abdullah bohan haslim a chance for singapore to draw level haslim harun the opportunity was there but haslim took it a little bit too quickly and the ball just went higher and higher over the crossbar amin rafi good play by rafi ali abdullah bohan oh doing very well in a very unfamiliar role up front this is good play by singapore but in the end the players got into each other's way well done norhalis shafik could he make up for that mistake it's a good cross good jump though by yanu midleslav malek kawak superb play but not a very good cross to match it rafi almost did it look like an inch perfect cross good effort under such circumstances so he's settling down very nicely this uh twenty year old rafi ali and it's uh very nice to see uh two players from the goh chok tong development scheme nazri and uh rafi they've graduated from that scheme playing along each other tonight the fans still very hopeful that singapore would back from this one goal deficit and remember the carrot dangling in front of them now is a thousand dollars per goal if they win that came from a manufacturing company oh poor defending once again by the singapore team but papanathan coming all the way back to do a good defensive job then and a very poor ball up front there but k kannan he should have released it much much earlier razali zilin amin good play by amin nasir malek to nazri well done k kannan to nazri almost getting round this player but still fail oh good play by nazri nasir work so hard to get the ball back and charles tindy had no choice but to put it up for a throw in to singapore devaraj closely policed by matu simbowi good turn though by devaraj a little bit late on the cross but it was nazri who finally crossed it and uh and a strange decision then by the goalkeeper yarusla he came all the way out for it it's certainly wasn't his ball kannan with a corner the fans urging the singapore players on good play this is haslim oh chips back again by abdullah bohan but nobody was there except for gerard pogileo who headed the ball out good one though by haslim harun and we saw flashes of his uh nineteen ninety season brilliance should i say we haven't seen much of it he's had two goals to his credit though this season so far the ball inside to rafi kannan once again he just didn't want to shoot and now here comes a counterattack where the danger lies definitely a foul on bobby chua papanathan now once again let us remind you that the uh sabah offensive force is a very very fast lot and it's so very crucial to counter their speed yanu midloslav they're definitely looking for the head of uh witaslav now but it's abdul malek's ball he comes up playing this very well so hard to counterattack very quickly as well v devaraj good play by devaraj to haslim good ball control oh lost out wonderful covering by yanu midloslav though he came back all the way from his uh position but he took the free kick to cover that malek superb play by malek kawak down to abdullah bohan doing some very hard running abdullah bohan and uh causing he's called in a few problems on the other side of the field the sabah defensive third devaraj to abdullah  deciding to take his defender on defender running defender and we have an offender the form of uh sabah's checkason word  kilan the sabah team just up soaking up the pressure now depending on their defensive qualities to shut out this singapore side rafi oh they're in sixes and sevens at the moment though the sabah team the singapore boys just fail to capitalise on that
