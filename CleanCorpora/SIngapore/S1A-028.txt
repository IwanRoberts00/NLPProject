""
""
being down with illness for a while
""
""
good break ha
""
""
i don't know
""
haven't tasted like pain
""
""
aiyaks
""
""
and illness
""
""
 word  ya
""
""
for some time you know
""
""
uh huh good experience
""
""

""
""
ah i'm i won't be awfully upset lah
""
""

""
""
i'll just be sick that's all
""
""
so long as you know that it's not like life or death
""
you know
""
i mean you know that you're going to pull through it that's alright
""
if you know you're  word 
""
""
even deaf also i don't know
""
uh i mean if if if i'm the one who's going to die it's not so bad
you know
""
""
uh huh
""
""
if someone i love or or
""
""
uh huh
""
""
someone i know is dying that's more painful
""
""

""
but if you are going to die yourself it's it's alright lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
it's not so bad
""
""
uhm
""
""
so that's why
""
""
i see i see
""
""
actually uh so i i wondered why i brought it up as a prayer
item

""
""
uhm it's not like i'm very frightened you know

i am very frightened because of the marks that leaves behind
""
vainpot
""
""
ya ya lah
""
that's it lah
""
""
cos' i am vainpot
""
""
for me for me dying would be like uhm tsk terribly
self-centred but i don't think they'll be able to manage without me
""
""
uhm
""
""
my family
""
""
uhm
""
""
you know i mean it's like that so i
""
people have asked me you know whether you prefer uhm your husband
to die or you to die first and all that and i've always said better he die
first
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
because i think i can take it
""
""
oh
""
""
but i think if i die i don't think he can take it
""
""
oh
""
""
you know you know what i mean
""
""
wow
""
""
ya you know so that that kind of a thing
""
so i i i don't understand this thing when you were saying
""
i mean i don't see it the same way
""
""
oh
""
""
like in the sense that it's okay if i die you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
to me it is not quite okay if i die
""
""
oh it is so different uh
""
""
ya
""
""
maybe
""
i don't know mine is more like an escape you see
""
""
uh huh
""
""
if i die tsk aiyah
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
you know i mean
""
okay lah
""
life is okay you know
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
but i'm not crazy about life you know what i mean
""
""
 laughs  ya ya ya
""
""
uh i mean
""
""
i think ya okay
""
""
there are a lot there is a lot of emptiness although there's a
lot of fun and and meaning
""
""
uhm
""
""
meaning in it as well lah but you know
""
""
ya
""
""
quite bad lah actually
""
""
ya i don't know
""
maybe you'd have to go through that you know  word
""
""
""
ya
""
don't know
""
but i'm very frightened when people hor i i like i love
""
""
uhm
""
""
in the family and things like that if they should die uh i
find that harder to take
""
""
oh
""
""
than if i myself find that i'm terminally ill
""
""
ah but i i don't know
""
i dread to see their ah their their their suffering like that you
know  word 
""
""
ng ya
""
that is why because you can't do anything
""
oh you mean their suffering if you die
""
""
ya ya ya ya
""
that that no no not not only when i die but to for them to see the
pain that i'm going through
""
""
ya ya ya
""
""
that's to me even more painful than probably what i'm you
know
""
""
ya
""
""
experiencing
""
that is how i see it lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
at this point in time lah
""
""
actually actually for me uh pain is not so bad you know
""
i hate it when it's it is scars
""
""
you got a high threshold uh
""
huh
""
""
and itchiness uh
""
""
is it
""
""
itch you know i can't stand the itch
""
""
uh huh uh huh
""
""
but i can take pain
""
""
is it
""
""
uhm i can't take itch
""
""
you have experience like you know a  word 
""
""
ya very bad pain
""
""
oh
""
""
i have uh or sometimes i've got this abdominal hernia
""
sometimes the pull is very bad
""
""
oh
""
""
but uhm but somehow pain is better than itch
""
i hate itch
""
""
ya it's unbearable and it's it is embarrassing to have to
scratch
""
""
ya i know
""
""
ya i think that is because
""
""
i think i am very vain
""
""
ya
""
""
i hope to live through life classily lah you know
""
""
ya
""
""
even if it is short uh
""
""
ya lah ya
""
""
at least if you are if you can live through it quite
stylishly uh
""
""
uhm uh huh
""
""
it is okay you know
""
""
and die with classy also
""
uh ya sort of
""
""
ya
""
i mean don't like
""
""
ya
""
""
ya
""
""
ya so that the last memory of you is still
""
""
ya that's right
""
""
this you know
""
""
that's right
""
""
such a talk
""
""
so frivolous uh
""
i'm so terrible i'm so frivolous rachael
""
i can't help being frivolous
""
""
you're being honest
""
""
aiyoh so frivolous
""
""
 word 
""
i don't know whether i'll be able to admit that okay if it were
true
""
ya but i guess i do want the good things in life too uh
""
""
ya
""
""
but not so concerned about what people think of me 
word 
""
""
uhm so
""
maybe it's
""
""
it's alright to scratch for me
""
""
for me it's not what people think uhm
""
""
uhm
""
""
of course that sometimes is important
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
""
""
but it's how i like to look at myself you see
""
""
my own self ya
""
""
i don't like to see myself as
""
like sometimes you sit at home and then the old habits come up
""
""
uh oh dear
""
""
the the like like you know you you pick your nose or you or
you dig into your toe nails
""
""
 word 
""
""
you know you dig into your toe nails when you watch tv
""
""
uh
""
""
aiyoh then i suddenly look at myself from outside sort of
like distance myself from
""
""
uh huh
""
and you don't accept that
""
""
my existence
""
and i just despise myself you see
""
""
don't like that  word 
""
""
ya
""
""
it's it's reminding me of hui li before she had chicken pox
""
she was rather vain you know
""
but then she had chicken pox that which left the scar in the
middle of her nose
""
""
i know
""
""
hey you know she sort of came back and and had to laugh about
it
""
""
ya
""
""
no choice
""
""
no choice
""
""
ya
""
""
quite terok uh
""
""
ya quite terok lah if you are that kind
""
""
ya
""
""
 sighs  so much  word  the
 word  the  word 
""
uh ya
""
""
 word  it's quite a funny conversation
right
""
""
right ya
""
ah there was an article today in the papers about uhm this guy his
surgeon who uhm had a pain himself in his abdominal area and he went to all
the tests
""
and uhm you know they really put him through  word
 plenty of tests and then he had to diagnose himself
""
and it was like you know uhm appendicitis lah but i don't know
""
i don't know what point i'm getting to actually
""
got no point uh
""
just talk about pain and death lah  word 
""
real pain he says
""
appendicitis is real pain
""
""
ya ya ya
""
""
ruptured appendicitis
""
""
ya that will
""
""
real pain
""
""
no uh some pain some type of pain are very scary because you
don't know where you're going
""
""
ya i think that's it
""
you don't see an end to it
""
""
ya
""
""
you know
""
""
that's right
""
""
that's why it's scary
""
""
that's right
""
""
ya
""
""
you don't know what the outcome would be
""
""
uhm
""
""
otherwise if you expect it
""
uh it's not so bad
""
it's no good
""
i mean you don't feel good but
""
""
eeee i wonder if i would
""
""
but it's not as bad as you know some
""
just like when you're when i was on the air-plane
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and the the my ears were very painful
""
""
uh huh ya
""
""
ah you don't know
""
it it's okay it was it was there for like five to ten minutes but
it lasted for about twenty minutes
""
""
oh
""
""
but during the time i couldn't i i begin to wonder whether it
would  word  any you know actually go off at all
""
""
ah
""
""
so that was quite frightening because
""
""
ah
""
""
you wonder if it's going to build up into a
""
""
boom ya
""
""
explosion then your your ear-drum bursts you know
""
""
ya
""
""
that kind of thing
""
""
ya
""
""
but toothache is fine headaches are fine
""
""
eee headaches are terrible
""
to me headaches are terrible
""
it's like whoa i i i really rather die
""
""
migraines are terrible
""
""
ya
""
""
ya when i have them it's like
""
""
what's the difference
""
""
oh there's a big difference you know
""
""
i never know
""
no i i never know the difference you know and i mean i don't know
whether what i'm having is migraine
""
""
migraine
""
""
migraine
""
""
or
""
uhm headache is i don't know headache is not so bad
""
it's just the pain in a certain part of the head
""
""
ya ya
""
""
but migraine uh is like
""
""
you see rashes you you that kind of thing
""
""
you want to
""
ya it's like something pulling my hair like that you know and then
i want to throw up as well
""
""
ya ya but i get that very often
""
""
maybe it's migraine
""
""
hey but i don't know what it is but a panadol solves it all
""
""
should go and see a doctor
""
oh mine came to a point when the panadol didn't solve it
""
""
ah
""
""
so i had to go and see him
""
""
ya
""
""
then now i'm on this uh medication called migral 
word 
""
""
no lah
""
is it
""
""
it's very good
""
it takes away instantly
""
""
is it
""
""
uh
""
""
oh maybe i'm not having migraine then
""
""
maybe
""
""
because a panadol works
""
""
more women get it you know than men it seems
""
stress uh
""
""
stress and maybe like being out in the sun for you know
really  word 
""
""
uhm oh i get it after the rain you know

""
""
strange ha ya
""
""
uhm
""
""

""
""
it's like i think it's what the chinese call 'tao hong'   in
hokkien)
""
""

""
""
it's the rheumatism in the head
""
so after the rain you get it you know
""
""

""
""

something about

""
""
he suspected the guy was doing was going to hurt him or you
