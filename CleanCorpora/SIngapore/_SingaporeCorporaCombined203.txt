now good afternoon to all of you president of the arts club and arts club committee members colleagues the deanery and freshmen and friends well i should very fresh people because we mustn't be too gender you know specific well you have come really to the largest faculty of course the the president of the arts club has said that that the faculty is second to none but we can claim to be certainly the largest faculty on this campus with something like four thousand four hundred students uh three hundred and forty academic staff another ninety to hundred uh non-academic staff so we really are a very large faculty certainly the largest in terms of students and student welfare student education training is our business so we are again welcoming you to this uh faculty of the university i know that uh you've been exposed to a number of welcomes already but never mind this is the month of of when you're just uh coming in and you're most welcome now i'll like to just also say that the deanery reflects the faculty as a whole even among my colleagues i'm from the history department the vice-deans are from geography and political science the sub-deans from economics and statistics and from social work and psychology so we represent already five departments and several subjects because you can see that some of the departments are double-barrel departments with a couple of subjects now we have act actually eleven departments now we have twelve but mass com became a programme the department of mass com was transferred to the second university but we continue with the mass communication programme in this faculty so we've got eleven departments and we've got four faculty programmes together with a new programme being offered by the department of english language and literature namely theatre studies so things are happening we have not just a large faculty but a faculty which comes with a lot of intellectual activity a lot of interesting activity now we're an arts faculty so remember this we want to cultivate not simply uh personality but really the artistic sides of your personality and this is something we want to develop not just giving information but to encourage the imagination this is what art is about but more than that we are also a faculty of arts and social sciences so there's that element of really seeking to be a bit more scientific about things although it's social science there's that element in it trying to uh be more precise to use more quantitative methods and not just using imagination so we want to anchor it in more specific uh inquiries uh this is not to say that the humanities are you know rather free-floating and the science the social sciences are rather hard no there's a blend of it but in your first year you're doing three subjects so you have a chance to uh combine arts and social sciences if you wish and not only also uh this kind of combination but remember combine combining certain subjects with programmes which are multi-disciplinary i'm talking about european studies south-east asian studies linguistics which are supposed to be multi- and even inter-disciplinary and in the case of the studies programmes and the studies departments remember that also that element of language which you are able to pick up so we are really very proud and very happy that we have an opportunity opportunity to offer you such a variety of riches uh in terms of intellectual activity and stimuli now of course you'll be very uh still finding your feet i mean subjects actually but be assured that most students are able to get some of their top choices most of them most of you so be encouraged however if you do have difficulties do try to be a bit uh adventurous a bit more adaptable and be prepared to make a few little changes uh in your thinking so that you can uh maybe pick up something which is new and from our little research we found that don't worry those who even were given you know subjects which didn't really feature in their first three choices managed to do well enough and very few of those who have to do supplementaries and fail really were those who you know just couldn't cope with the subjects they're given so there's no real correlation uh between those who had their first choices and doing extremely well in them or those who did not get their choices and doing badly in them so be encouraged but if you have problems we have uh the department uh to give advice as well as members of the deanery especially the vice-dean dr lee boon hiok and also our our our faculty associate mrs ann wee they're here to really advise you to help you i always say that the vice-dean is not a terrible person unlike the dedication word / designation word  / delegation word 'vice-dean' you know who's out to to look out for vices and or something like that no nothing like that the vice-dean is and and the vice-deans in fact are both ad-vice-deans they give good advice uh on certain matters and both of them are very intimately involved in helping student matters in in student matters not not just one professor lee boon hiok give uh more you know advice about course enrolments and combinations and so on but uh dr victor savage is our liaison with the arts club and societies and he tells me to give a little bit of encouragement to you all of course you are practially ipso facto members of the arts club but be encouraged also to join uh some societies uh the ones which you feel can be of most help uh to you but also be a bit adventurous join other societies even if you're not reading a particular subject so you get a wider exposure to the range with we offer in our faculty well these are just some words of encouragement at this stage because you will hear a lot of things being said a lot of information that you might even get uh intellectual con constipation of some sort terrible you know just can't digest all these things but try to take stock try to pause at times reflect and don't let uh it become systems-overload and all the alarm bells start ringing don't worry just try to uh pause at times take stock of what uh is being offered don't just consult seniors but also attend lectures for yourselves to see what the courses are about before you try to make your choices such choices as you have but nonetheless be encouraged at this time don't be you know despondent because there're always people who are around who can help you well on that note i again warmly welcome you to the faculty on behalf of my colleagues and i wish you every success in your time with us thank you  good evening faculty colleagues friends from the administration and the library and other university officers and students especially the first year's prize winners and ladies

certainly they're very important people in the administration whom you should also meet during the tea we're very happy that they are represented here now i'll like to just say a short word of this tea and why we've organized it well this is intended of course mainly for newcomers although sometimes we have gatecrashers from the other years because they've they've come to know what the tea is about it's a welcome tea especially for freshers but we also welcome old friends and we also have invited first year lecturers and visiting professors to join us so you see some people who are word here only for one year as well as those who teach the first years uh meeting us in this tea this is a good meeting point because in singaporean style it's a eating point where there're eats there're also meets now we also want to use this opportunity to honour to recognise to honour our prize winners our students who have well in their studies as well as society and club people who have helped in student life so this is an opportunity to just say thank you a very big thank you to them now in this connection i want to associate myself with the arts club president in congratulating the club and those who were particularly involved in the making of the faculty float which as lincoln reminded you won a silver medal in the competition yes yesterday so thanks again arts club and all the helpers who made the float i'll like also uh on this very first occasion when i address all of you together to mention that we have introduced two new programmes this year one is an undergraduate programme and that is the art the theatre studies programme which is offered by the department of english language and literature for the first time and we want to congratulate the department for doing so and to welcome all those of you who are registered for theatre studies and then the second programme is a postgraduate programme and that is the masters in public policy which is managed by the centre of advanced studies and under its director professor ong jin hui this is a again a first for our faculty and we've very much uh looked forward to welcoming people from not only singapore but people from the asean countries they've come to join us and even beyond from mexico so we're very happy for the faculty that we have this programme running for the first time this this session i'd like also to make little comments about mass communication again i think that many of you if not most are aware that while mass communication has been transformed from a department to a programme  this is because it was felt that uh for the sake of not dividing resources between the two universities it should should be more or less centralized in the nanyang technological tech technological university nonetheless we have uh obligation to our students in mass communication so last year and again for this year we've taken in a first year intake for mass communication so it's not not not it's no longer a department it is a very vibrant programme of the faculty and uh director of the programme professor eddie kuo is simultaneously dean of the school of communication studies ntu which will receive it's first intake next year so this is just to explain the little change but nonetheless we are very much assured the students are assured that things will go on as usual you will graduate with nus degrees so we're very happy that this will not really affect resources being/been given to the mass communication students and staff so i thought this would be important to explain now a word to the freshies a special word now we want want to congratulate those who have made it because for everyone who has been accepted into the two universities four or five have been turned away so those of you who have come in you're very fortunate and we want to warmly welcome and congratulate you on coming into nus and to our faculty we also would like to say that it's a bit be bewildering to be a member a student in the faculty of arts and social sciences because there are eleven departments and four faculty programmes one department programme and so on and so many other subjects which have been offered including an import of mathematics from the science faculty but i'll like to assure you that we have a embarrassment of riches not of poverty to contend with now you may not always have the subjects of your choice but we'll try and give you uh perhaps your first choice at least of two or three of your choices as far as possible but at this stage i want to counsel a little bit of flexibility on your part please don't be too disappointed if you don't get all the three subjects of your choice but we'll try our best to accomodate uh you in at least uh your your top two choices so this is just a word to all of you because in trying to be fair to some we might be unfair to so many others so i trust you'll understand our constraints and on your part exercise a little bit of uh flexibility and adaptability as you come in for the first year but nonetheless may i in advance wish you every success in your studies and your eca uh on this campus now in conclusion i'll like to thank especially the faculty's social committee and the arts club people who've helped in organizing this welcome tea and now what else remains we're going to eat soon but there remains also to give out the prizes and i want to in in advance congratulate all of the prize winners and those who have contributed to the faculty and then after that of course we can all have tea together thank you
