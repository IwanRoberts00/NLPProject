so uhm now i've three draughtsmen right i have siew kiau emily uh siew kiau emily diana ah diana and then thomas for the editing so what i ask them to do is simon had already given me the list of  word  uh what what they have submitted you know to the authorities and what they have produced so far lah so next week we can arrange word to discuss about that ya 'think the problem now is really to see how far they have managed to go with the different drawings that they have to do uhm i now uh diana is doing all the word submission drawings she's already finishing up you know uh amending the drawings to fit  word requirements uh so she's doing it manual not on computer and uh diana is now doing for me all the drawings for the the contractor the diaphragm more openings so she's clearing up that lot and then emily is doing elevation drawings with the pre-cast panels four by four work out all the dimensions how far uhm from the coluhmn grid and so on and also i uh the sewage now the sewage reply has come back she has to do updating uhm in the computer so how do you think tom can help to sort of vet the drawings or uh sort of help you in the detailing of some of these things because i think at the moment he does seem to feel a bit difficult uh problems in in co-ordinating some of these drawings is it he didn't fill a form because i i i think the problem also partly because of this computer drawing thing you know ah because we had we can't get a feel of what are the the drawings in the computer what i've asked him to do so far is like for instance the sewage unit uh once the reply came back uhm uh i i made some comments on the reply by by sewage right then i ask uh him to look through and discuss with emily so he looked through emily's set of drawings and discussed how the requirements uh can be met nuh so uh he also went down with emily to see the offices in environment uhm to discuss about their requirement whether we can do it or not or is it cost costing a problem and so on ya so that is the technical part i think he can help me do you know ya all these nitty gritty detail things so uhm it's the same for like the contractor drawings uh uhm because he's got more technical knowledge for the actual construction uhm so if that's true he ask diana to help draw up all these things uh so has he managed to get onto that yet ya he's doing that now but what what i find problem is he's he has not enough time also you know ya so when whenever i ask him he may not do it promptly oh he said do it later ya so like the diaphragm mode we are a bit behind time giving information uhm ya ya i think that's why we are sort of discussing to see what of any of the other work he can uh sort of delegate to other people so that he can have more time for your project when you say continue working drawing you mean uhm they consult him on the detailing or he just checks the drawing i think that he has to i think it would be better if he could really co-ordinate all the drawings so that uh because certain problems which occur on other projects he can sort of make sure that it doesn't recur in this one things like that and the amount of detailing you know because i think for us uhm you i think you'll you need to do a lot more design work right uhm so a lot of these details in a way is probably like wasting your time if you have to go and give all the details to the draughtsmen so this type of things if he can help to uhm give instructions to to them uhm uhm like even like uh now i get the set of drawings from structure word from contractor drawing word  there's slight difference there's a lot of checking to be done uhm yes yes uh to check against our architectural drawings for discrepancies uhm so uhm yes some of those if he can whether he will be the one actually doing it or he should have he will as eh de designate and allocate duties to the rest i think those type of details if the draughtsman who is doing the actual drawing of say the rises uhm they probably uh know the details of the rises sort of better so maybe the the to themselves can can check some of those type of details but those things which are like okay staircase details and those floor plans sections and all that uhm i think tom can help to just check that what they've drawn uhm is sort of practical or you know any uhm detailing things that they've to look out for uhm and uhm i don't know perhaps we should also look into what we can use standard drawings uhm see what other things whether there are any standard drawings that you can sort of incorporate uhm rather than having to actually now they're not really getting into details yet you know it's it's still overall plan and getting levels correct uhm floor like staircase trap riser and landing levels floor  word levels uhm and then the riser opening shifting the beams and all these things okay uhm ya but i think we have to already start on the details right because or else uhm august is very close i know like i i ya try to list like ya there's one thousand and one drawings to do you know that's right how to finish you know ya that's right ya i don't know hopefully with the new drauhtsmen coming in for cmb i don't know whether we can use any uh to produce whether there they can help us or not can we use their resources i think if if they are not uh i don't know whether they need  word straightaway now or not uhm whether we can help whether they can help to do something for us first uhm because our timing is a bit ahead of theirs right uhm so it'll be something we have to discuss with the lam side uh uhm you want to talk anything more interesting ya the d and d uh janet is going to be my stage manager so uhm have you got the tape uh i can't i can't recall having it you know i've asked you to check with nina huh because uh she was handling the thing because jin jin said uh she returned the tape to you jin jin was the one who did the taping of the friday background and said uh news opening piece uh i've to go through so last night i tried i taped the news and then i did a narration of the opening scene uh then after that i was supposed to tape friday background you know then my sister her stupid watch was slow by five minutes so i i was talking so you were with her and a friend so by the time i went and word the tv the uh hey uh opening scene music was gone so i tape the ending of friday background the music i'm not sure if it's the same as the opening music ha i can't recall i'll go through whatever tape i can find uh but i can't recall if i had it what i would have done with it you see uhm but uh i think in fact they had it on different tapes is it because i taped the voice myself oh that was oh you did the newsreading i did the newsreading uhm but i think i did i tape onto that i can't remember maybe i did uh i can't remember i'll i'll you see if you can find lah ya if not i'll just use whatever i've taped you know uhm it's just that the friday background only comes like i think every two weeks right one word  is it two weeks i think it's every two week you know i thought there's only one then there's contact-y then there's feed oh yes every two weeks there's feedback fortnightly oh feedback and then friday background feedback friday it'll be too late next week it's it's saturday is d and d ya ya ya ya so he's she's doing stage management now he's going to collect all the props for me lah uhm the only problem we have is like word i forgot to call mandarin uh to ask them whether they have a whiteboard and a flip chart we want to mount the you know the carpark sign on the uhm uhm uhm flip chart you know ya and then use their whiteboard to pin up the world map i thought flip chart flip chart we can still bring but whiteboard will be rather big quite difficult i think they should have uh because we don't have a flip chart they what they use last time was a a smaller whiteboard y' know which is still quite high uhm on castors i don't think we can put that into her car i think mandarin should have lah because they organise seminars  word   word seminars ya i think they should have flip chart so they should have so these are the only two things uh that mandarin has to provide lah the rest we can bring right uhm prop uh costuhmes and uh what else huh the guns and all that have they given you the stage layout no i think i shall ask from them ya because in case they have the big uhm sound mixers and all that the deejays equipment ya may be blocking don't know if they show that on the layout then they will have to check with the word huh thursday we have rehearsal they slotted us on thursday on stage is it ya at mandarin okay because the last time when we had the other show remember we had to discuss with victor khoo where he was going to put all his deejay desk and all that ya see this woman that woman uh can't stand her she just wrote a letter to mandarin you know who is this woman and then tsk okay kr ya lah ya now this woman who is the secretary lah of the committee uh so she just wrote a letter and cc to menon the chairman right and then give it word  then menon gave it to me she just word  in the letter your rehearsal time is what time to what time and then another organization what time to what time and tell the banquet manager to prepare uh we need how many standing mikes and all that very simple lah her requirements is standing mikes stage of what size and so on so i've called her up i said uh are you sure they will be able to give us the exact layout on thursday d and d is on saturday they might have other functions on friday right uhm so the last time our last year d and d they couldn't give us the exact ya arrangements ya so there's no point going down if there is no they can't give provide you the exact arrangement so i called her on the phone she said oh i assuhme he has to do it i already wrote to him you know  uh i already told him what's our requirement and he should prepare that on thursday she also cc to the deejay of that night is it victor khoo uh no it's leslie pillay leslie pillay one of those guys on either radio or tv lah uhm uhm so uh i said then can i call uh the sales banquet manager myself she said yeh you go and call yourself so i had to call the banquet manager and ask him are you going to provide all those things that she lists down in her letter i mean she can't even be bothered to contact him and find out if everything will be okay uhm uhm uhm uhm it's all on the letter only uhm in fact last time we even went down to to discuss with the deejay and everything what the exact location ya ya so she cc to the deejay i hope the deejay turns up on thursday i doubt it you know i mean she's not even ya bothered to find out if those people will turn up because uhm what else because if they have say a big prize table on stage ya the deejay's thing on stage the rostruhm and all that then then i ask her you know do we have a day-room that we can store our props uhm then she say no just at the the usual lah say where do you keep your lucky draw prizes uhm she said oh we just keep it backstage ya so i thought normally the hotel will give a room ya so i ask the banquet sales manager by on the phone uh i ask him he said ya we're giving them the organizer a day-room ya ya i would think so what the last time we had a day-room also right ya ya word  i think she just don't want us to use it ya must be
