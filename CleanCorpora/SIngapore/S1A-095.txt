""
""
ya i'm trying to get lay peng to come back to help out also

or maybe once in a while when she needs a break from her books
""
""
ya
""
""
then well

loads of rats as you know

""
yep

he's doing his phd under him
""
""

""
""
dr tee
""
""
oh boy that's in uh that's interesting
""
i mean it's oh
""
actually she was an ra right
""
""
ya she was an ra but uhm  word 
""
""
was she working for a degree then or just not
""
""
no she wasn't she wasn't and they uh actually she was supposed
to be hired under him
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
as an ra but i guess they wanted to save cost and asked her to
convert it to a a phd by research
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so she's looking around for a scholarship
""
""
oh i see
""
""
 word 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
to buy more equipment
""
""
uhm uhm
""
are they actually working on the same uh
""
""
they're working on the rat  word 
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
""
oh about uh the wednesday evening's dinner i probably not join you
""
""
oh why
""
""
oh oh actually this week i'm really busy with uh work to
complete and i guess i shall miss the fun
""
""
oh you mean they've been uhm pushing you and all that
""
""
no no no but uh there are some things i need to sort of sort
out and no i just in the process of sorting out the stats all those uh
terrible stats pile so
""
""
different tests and all that
""
""
uhm uhm ya
""
""
oh
""
""
so i thought that i should spend more time on it
""
""
but don't stay too late
""
""
uhm well it's nice
""
""
but it's quite uh dangerous for you to go out late at night in
that sense
""
""
not really because i can take the mrt from my uh from the the
bus-stop outside the engineering blocks
""
""
the mrt
""
""
uh sorry i mean duh i'll take ninety six and then i'll go the
mrt station so it's not that bad
""
it's not like a long walk compared to before and i had to take like
one nine seven   197  one nine eight   198)
""
""
uhm ya sounds ya  word 
""
""
uhm
""
""
but you still do you still have to walk through that little
path with the palm trees and all that
""
""
palm trees
""
uhm
""
""
or i think coconut trees
""
""
oh no no usually i'll go by the uh on the the sixth level
where they have the yellow roof you know that part
""
""
uh
""
""
is it
""
i mean the palm trees is where uhm like near yih right
""
""
ya
""
""
uhm i don't go through that way
""
""
oh you don't go through that way
""
""
nope
""
""
oh it's the one that's just uhm opposite arts is it
""
""
uhm opposite o what
""
""
arts uh uhm central library
""
""
uhm ya ya ya right
""
uhm uhm
""
ya so in a way it's quite convenient
""
ya so long as i don't go to the thirty three   33  bus-stop i feel
safer
""
you know the one that's behind
""
""
the one that's behind
""
""
uhm uhm the one that's uhm like you have to go down the long
flight of steps and then you go through i mean it's like with all trees and
bushes and
""
""
oh ya
""
""
uhm
""
""
so
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so what have you been doing besides work
""
""
well uh guess what
""
for the weekend i spent the entire weekend sorting photographs
""
""
oh for me to see
""
""
ya sort of uhm i'll probably bring them in one day and trying
to find one that has got a clear picture of the the the face of a girl i told
you about
""
""
oh
""
""
so that uh you'll probably be able to see it better
""
""
uhm
""
""
because the rest of it are pretty blur
""
""
oh how come
""
""
ya uhm guess not well taken and i don't have too many of it
""
""
oh
""
""
i only have like uh maybe one or two clear ones
""
""
okay so  word  so should i expect you to
carry in a big note
""
""
oh no no no
""
i'm just going to bring maybe one
""
""
only one nuh
""
i thought you'll show us your album
""
""
oh ya i can
""
""
 word 
""
""
i can but not i mean the rest will not be on her though
""
the rest will be like uh very scenery sort of un you know crazy
things that i did
""
""
oh but i want baby  word  too
""
""
oh well i don't have any
""
""
you don't have any
""
""
right
""
""
not even one
""
""
no the oldest or rather the youngest i have is six
""
so if you consider that as a baby
""
""
well never mind that will do
""
i can imagine
""
my little exhibit
""
""
ya right
""
oh
""
okay someday i'll bring it
""
""
when will you be coming down again
""
""
uhm don't know
""
not at this point
""
i guess maybe when i start working at nuh again
""
""
oh
""
will it take long
""
""
hopefully in the next two weeks
""
""
oh that depends on how fast you finish your analysis is it
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
i see
""
""
or rather depends on prof ong
""
""
oh when when he decides to have space for you
""
""
uhm uhm ya
""
""
at first recently they've been having a lot of short courses
and speakers from  word  and all that
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
 word  uh he's always showing people
around
""
""
uhm oh
""
""
and and dr ng has been using the room quite frequently
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so even if you come i think you'll be slightly disturbed by
him
""
""
oh oh
""
""
there's this group of students coming in and  word
""
""
""
but i guess i won't be using much of that room because uh
since this is going to be at the workplace you know the workstation of
whoever is going to participate
""
""
uhm
""
""
then so it looks like most of the time except for the uhm
calibration which can be done not necessary in that room
""
""
uh huh
""
""
it can be done outside too
""
""
oh
""
""
and the rest of it uhm who will done at the subjects' uh work
workstation
""
""
and so you'll be running around carrying all your equipment
and all that
""
""
uhm ya maybe or rather the subject will be running around
""
ya with the electrodes on
""
""
i see oh but do you have to bring a new brief case of
electrodes and stuff like that
""
""
uhm you mean over to nuh from here
""
""
uhm no to your subjects
""
""
uh no no no
""
they'll be in other words uhm after they finish up their
calibration which you know i could always do it outside
""
""
uh
""
""
uhm near where you work
""
""
uh huh
""
""
then uhm after that she's free to move about and this time
it'll be quite different in the sense that she won't have those uhm like the
angle equipments attached so she'll only have like uh six electrodes attached
to her and that's it
""
""
ya
""
""
so probably will be  word  on made easier
for her to move around
""
""
uh huh
""
""
ya
""
""
 word  computer to monitor her movement
and all that
""
""
oh
""
""
she has to cart that around you see
""
""
ya but that would be placed at the workstation
""
""
oh
""
""
at uh huh you know where wherever she works
""
""
get them to provide you with the laptop
""
""
ya that was what i was thinking
""
maybe you could borrow one from your department
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
ya it'll be a lot more convenient than carting one 
word 
""
""
ya in fact the spot i used when i was in nuh hp
""
""
oh that's because alex is there and then
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
 word  give you laptops and all that
 word 
""
""
uhm uhm ya
""
""
 word  probably a personal laptop
""
well you can ask you can borrow from dr tee
""
he's got a new one and he's quite happy with it
""
""
oh dear
""
""
well it's a macintosh
""
""
uh huh
""
""
 word 
""
""
oh he has got every all the new facilities
""
""
ya it's like he's so augh i can't stand him
""
""
well does he still play that games and make those noise
""
""
uuh
""
""
the singing and
""
""
occasionally hoping that you're not around
""
""
oh uhm
""
good after-work entertainment
""
""
ya
""
""
and he finally finished his notes so he can take a breather
for a while but hadiah says she's chasing him
""
""
what notes
""
""
uhm for the short course
""
he helps out in the short course his lectures and all that
""
""
hah
""
uh huh
""
""
so he has to produce a set of notes
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so hadiah has to chase him each time for the notes because
it's late
""
""
oh boy
""
he probably has too much to say
""
""
but i mean he actually he's involved in so many things
""
he's got so many projects running at same time
""
""
ah
""
""
and and he's also got a uhm poly student attached to him
""
""
uh huh
""
""
for i don't know what they are doing but at the moment the
poly student is doing a lot of calculations
""
""
uhm
""
""
on molarity
""
""
oh
""
well in a way it's good
""
it keeps you really you know involved
""
""
uhm
""
""
otherwise well make good use of his brain
""
""
i asked him how come he took so many things
""
then he said oh he just want to test his limits
""
see how far he can stretch
""
""
he
""
ya
""
precisely
""
after all he's talented so uh gifted so so you know got to squeeze
every bit out of him
""
""
ya i guess it's alright for him because he's still single and
all and all that
""
""
uhm
""
""
if he has a family it can be quite  word 
""
""
uhm uhm yep and besides uh well he's young and energetic so
""
""
uh
""
""
uhm but now that he has got a new companion
""
""
ya the cassette i don't know how it is
""
i must go and ask him what happen  word 
""
i haven't seen him the whole day today
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
oh do you know that uh bee lan has given birth
""
""
who
""
oh oh
""
""
bee lan
""
""
for one moment i thought you're referring to the other bee
lan  word 
""
""
wrong bee lan
""
the other bee lan  word 
""
""
uh
""
oh i see
""
so is it a girl or boy
""
""
a little boy uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
and then the baby was two weeks overdue uh i think
""
""
oh uhm uhm
""
""
but i think it's uhm they induced the birth
""
""
uh huh
""
""
so it's quite okay
""
in fact she had contractions but then the baby didn't come out
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so she came back to work again
""
""
oh
""
""
for a couple of more days
""
then she was  word  admitted again on saturday
so on sunday they induced the birth
""
""
uhm uhm is that her first baby
""
""
no her third child
""
""
whoa
""
""
she's already got one girl and one boy
""
""
uh huh oh
""
""
so uhm there's about eight of us sharing to buy presents for
her
""
""
oh
""
""
and among them is prof ong dr hee and dr david koh
""
""
oh oh
""
""
so i told lay har to charge them double  word
 
""
""
good idea yep uhm
""
""
uhm don't know anyway lay har is  word 
responsible for buying all the baby things uh probably she get milk powder
and diapers
""
""
uhm uhm uhm she's really experienced
""
""
ya because for us it's like we didn't know what to get at
first we thought we just uh combine and get some milk contribute some cash to
give it to her
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
but not very nice
""
""
uhm uhm yep
""
""
so we nominated lay har
