okay this this one is the living assurance policy and uhm what i will advice is that you top up thirty-five to uh fifty thousand alright the first column show you the total premium you pay over the year uh second column is the cash value alright cash value means that anytime you want to terminate your policy you can take back the cash money you can get back ya you terminate the policy ya if you terminate the policy this is the amount of money you can get back alright uh death benefit of course uhm it means the twenty-six illnesses uh it's covering as well as in time of death or total and permanent disability then you are quite clear about the type of policy we're having right paid up i forget paid up is the one uh okay let's say say for example number ten year okay i i stop payment or the premium and this and i let the policy goes on so this is the uh uh coverage isn't it okay paid up means that okay at any time uh any one year if you want to stop paying alright if you get that in cash it's going to be very much less than what you're going to get alright so if you opt for pay up means that you know the policy will still run lah it will still down anytime down the years let's say ten years later if you opt for a pay up at tenth time even is uh twenty years down the road it will still pay you that particular value ya for example if let's say at the tenth year you opt for pay up which is eleven thousand so another ten years down the road okay you will only they will only eleven thousand if something happen to you if something happen ya i mean of course here it means uhm it means in terms of the twenty-six sicknesses or in time or death and total and disability four o six such a small policy that's because uhm uhm uh top it up for your last twenty-five thousand i didn't know that last time i bought so such a small policy oh yes i am trying to ask you to buy a bigger policy you say no no no such a small policy fifteen thousand so should i keep increase to what fifty thousand fifty thousand are you sure but i don't want to i i don't want to spend so much money alright normally for uhm for any insurance policy what you should consider is that uhm you can either pay uh about fifteen per cent of your annual salary alright the total premium should be about fifteen per cent of your annual salary that is a lot isn't it uhm alamak fifteen is a lot of money well it's uh money from the left hand pocket to the right hand pocket you still get back every cent eventually it's a lot of money and i say you you still get back every cent eventually alright so as i said it's either fifteen per cent of your annual salary or uhm it's uh six times your annual salary the total amount you should return six times six to seven times your annual salary depending on the age six times ya it's also a lot then you are under insured i have how much let's see how much i have maybe perhaps talking about six times i have maybe only uh how much am i insured how much are you insured less than two hundred thousand no uh no okay when i talk about six seven time your annual salary alright it also cover your term policy alright it will cover uhm the amount which your company is buying for you it doesn't means that everything is out of your pocket okay and uh normally as a person grow older the amount uhm insured over the annual salary can be less for example if you are in your forties then the amount which can be five times your annual salary because by then your income would have increased so it cannot be six seven times in at that fifteen thousand for four hundred dollars this is very little right ya expensive no it's not kim wan one how much uh i forgot four hundred plus also ya but kim wan age is uhm that one is without loading uh that is without loading but of course i'm giving her the standard right but actually when it comes back to us i think probably does she need to go through another policy uh uh uh medical check up i doubt so because it's only in the matter of one year so not necessary ya but as i say i can't say anything in this present moment if the underwriter need her to go for a medical check check-up she has to also alright why underwriter so cautious well uhm the risk is there you see and uh that type of medication which she is taking is still basically the same so i'm not very sure whether they still need uhm to uh for her to go for another check-up your this uh so-called concession what or offer period or concession rate until end of this year it's just no it's up to thirtieth of november but of course uh don't wait until the last minute because uh it may be some complication who knows you think something like telecoms rush ya ya ya you'd be surprised you know no lah what telecoms rush you won't have another telecoms rush no what i mean of course not but what i'm trying to say is that okay give us two weeks you know because maybe you need a medical check-up you know i need a medical check-up don't be too sure don't be too sure i am very sure i am very sure actually not bad uh medical check-up free medical check-up i want to go for medical check-up i talked about it for years no action so you want a free medical check-up free right ya but can refer one right but they only charge you on your blood sorry on your blood and urine that's right not i went for blood test cholesterol don't know what it's because of the you know the i want to go on the acu test the acu test so you need a blood test so coming back to this policy maybe i should refresh your memory later alright uh for example let's look at uhm fifty-five if you decide to stop paying and if something happen uh ten years down the road okay they're still be paying you the new uhm aye how come benefit minus the ten years without uh minus the ten years premium it's it's different from paying up uh it's different ya that must be after paying back normally people will opt for it only after a few years because it make no sense you see for example if if if you pay for about fifteen years or so this policy can actually run until you're in eighties and i think it's worth while considering because you are only covered medically until fifty-five until sixty fifty-five or sixty after that you're not cover uhm by any medical insurance this one is sixty uh no those who are sixty-five no no no i show the figure fifty-five sixty sixty-five because this is the time when people stop paying you see because when you retire as long as this policy you don't terminate it will continue you know so up to your eighties even in your nineties but you it only covers up to sixty-five what or something no no no no fifty-five something like that isn't it you're wrong no no you're wrong no no no i thought the policy was was was uh okay this policy technically alright technically alright will be you have to pay up to eight well you have to pay up to eighty-seven years alright that means if you continue paying when the person is eighty-eight alright that's when the policy become free but normally people won't pay for such a long period so normally people pay for fifteen years or they pay until they are fifty-five sixty or sixty-five then you stop paying alright and the policy will be able to run on so let's say if you stop paying at fifty-five or sixty right if something happen to you at seventy years old they will still pay you so it is actually uhm quite sometimes it's after uh all along i thought this policy were only cover up to what sixty-five years old or fifty-five years old or something like that no no it used to be like that isn't it it was never use to be like that i think you got it wrong right from the start no i thought so no i remember it it was no as i was explaining for example okay uhm if you stop paying at fifty-five okay the coverage is forty-three right now at sixty-five if something happen to you okay they will pay you sixty-nine minus the ten year premium plus interest uhm so isn't that very attractive what so attracting what what do you mean by not so attractive because you already stop paying they're giving you the new coverage minus the ten year premium plus uh it's attractive if it's free and if it's attractive is free nothing is for free uhm nothing is for free ya to break-even so it takes so long to break-even fifteen years uhm break-even is about uh fourteen fifteen years takes so long uhm whether it's long or short it's relative actually i can go and buy a what and tick or this one cannot be as a rider right you told me before i bought it can be as a rider but a rider will stop at sixty in that sense you are right you buy a rider you will stop covering you at sixty and for a rider there is no bonus included alright that means if something happens to you let's say if you buy a thirty thousand rider attach to a policy it's cheaper right it's much cheaper but if let's say nothing happen you won't get a single cent and if something happen you'll only get but the main policy the main policy uh it's income generally ya the basic policy there is bonus so as you see the figure actually increase for example you look at the cash value uh on return here is a very small amount but as you go along you know the amount increase is it cheaper if i go in that way i i do it that way that i buy another like some other policy then i take this as a rider is it more more i think it's not advisable why because this policy how come i don't have a convertible rider because you never buy a rider but does that really matter you see it's still at the same rate whether i i get the rider or not ya but presumably let's say if you are medically unfit right now if you have a rider then the company have not right to reject you you get what i'm trying to say ah ha alright so the other about this policy is that now if you take it as a rider now this policy or rather the rider will stop paying when you are sixty and the two particular disease which you have alzheimer and parkinson and that basically attack a person in their old age and a lot of this problem actually you know uh appears when the person is old and it doesn't make sense you know that you buy this policy to protect you right now but when it come to your old age there's nothing to protect you
