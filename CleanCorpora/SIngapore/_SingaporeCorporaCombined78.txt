occur to me until night time when i suddenly realise that you were probably moving in or something well last night i waited for over an hour for the people what time where for the people to come to eusoff hall oh you mean you're in eusoff not temasek i'm in temasek but the people were going to eusoff oh two of them why did you have to wait for them  word  oh you mean like they had just arrived

must be about sixty over then always kena teased by this other guy uhm he said what do you want to go to town with me then he said no lah on second thought you better stay back and to start writing your paper to present and then the other guy rebutted no i'm gonna wait till i get the programme to see my name on the programme then i'll start he said yah you wait maybe the key speaker then you know you mean they don't know no they're okay okay what's the time now so how long do we have to be there tomorrow for the opening is still bloody unfair to word all the guys  word  you man are marginalised what do you think uhm i think it's okay    extract m3-3  recording 3 recording 4 so you had i'm the fourth person all right fourth conversation so people go to what do they say word  no i'm doing it on purpose because i know you expect that don't worry i'm used to this i'm used to this ok go away sign this sign this say that you don't mind signing this thing if you don't want your name come out ok then you don't tick it you know what i think word   laughing  censor no i think he's a great guy seriously seriously i think he's a great guy but his style of leadership is not suitable for the present generation seriously i mean i respect the fellow some more he did repay a lot than the world paid him i see ok ok i'd like to talk about other things ok let's talk about i teaching myself in what relativity and uh quantum mechanics  laughing  why are you laughing you are doing that for fun it's a hobby i teaching myself how can you teach yourself a subject as abstract as that  laughing  i'm a physics hongkey hongkey face don't give answers no i am a physics student i am doing physics can you read up now ok you are majoring in phylo no it's not phylo sorry it's phylan right can you pick up a phylan book of a certain level and be able to understand all these big theos and whatever because i've done that exactly but it's easy if something you studied before so isn't that what university education about training your mind having the ability now to pick up any book that you want to read and teach yourself wah no exactly now physics is possible right i mean can read anything anything new and absorb new ideas right the thing is it might possible and simple not it's not simple it's hard but the thing is it's possible just now when you paged me did you write down your number yourself no i did not it came as 354 0026 so i keep calling this family when this little kid picked up the phone and say mummy and daddy are at work who paged me no i never put down my one i just put the double now it just came out like that that's why i was wondering who was it paged me am i supposed to speakers come out with someone ah agree to the recording was singapore is a project of the word  wah mashiaolah it sounds like that meh yeah word  ah ok say second is my mum told me when i was a kid and it just start off ok and it was good what i'm supposed to take no no no no it's just if you want to be ornamous i don't care i want to be famous  laughing  so you guys know  word what do you research this for anyway and it's to study how like regional speakers or something so like how malay speak english do you have lah loh after all you know yes code-switching do you want me to speak like that now no or speak how are you yeah speak how are you speak normally ok no i've done this several times but not for this specific reason but for other reasons how if i don't get this ayah not that serious come on i mean there are options available i know how to feel but it could be the same way it's like right now i just don't have the energy almost to do anything yeah i'm just waiting for me to work for for for like three months on project basis well i don't want this type of working meh fuck you i don't like this type of working dee dee censor look you told me to speak normally   ok i know  i know i know i'm speaking normally here ha i mean like i mean ok my broo works but he is married i know and he doesn't earn enough to even feed himself and his wife and he just bought a car and all that so my mum is sort of supporting the family why why he why doesn't he change work then no no i mean he has lots of prospects he has good relationship with his immediate superiors he just got a diploma which were good recognised and his good working attitude they like him  so i would give him two three more... the only thing is he only has the confidence no more in singapore we all know your how much your paper qualification counts so if he stays there i would say within the next five years he would five years he will wait you know five years he would go up he would be have quite huge high level i would have to start talk to him about that you know cos he doesn't really know about promotions job prospects and all that increments he's a bit blur lah so i mean that's a good task for me to start working as soon as possible yet at the same time i don't want to work exactly but i have to work no i felt this way twice before after college canada and national service this emptiness spoiled...  word  yeah but... yeah i'm doing the same thing like you i'm helping out the csll word i'm most probably be conducting extra lessons for the kids at amp and all that uh i'm really teaching myself quantum mechanics and relativity and all that yet it doesn't do you feel joy yeah definitely you just feel like... i'm just going into that emotion i'm feeling from day to day waiting for my fucking results to come out and then... when is yours coming out mine is the 4th of june the day before yours on the day on the 4th i'll be coming to check if i get honours or not most probably i will not get it  word  what honours yeah the letter with... they will posted on the notice board this is another thing i don't even know if i can get it even if i get it i don't even know that i'll work at it yeah that's another thing for me also i'm just tired of exams i'm fucking tired the one paper statistics mechanics word  which i can't i couldn't afford to up and it was an easy paper and that made it worse because the module was " yeah it's ok ah" so for me i couldn't do it because i just got so tired you know i just... and to make matters worse four days later i was sitting in the physics department area and that same professor came down and saw me he came up saying " ai come on word i really enjoy your paper" this is the not an exam research paper we are asked to do " i really enjoy your paper it's original it's the first paper that i read and..." she didn't say explicitly but you one was thinking no other paper came close to it in terms of you know originality and thought cos that module was basically just reading from somewhere processing and just reduplicating in their own words word  but i felt so bad we don't have time to talk but only say " ei i'm sorry i up your exam" but in fact she is a good teacher i feel let let him down can have dinner lah actually word  yeah that's what i'm thinking but can do you have enough money to pay for me like fifteen dollars ok i can send you both if you have any extra word no i got twelve dollars  word  i got twelve dollars well you can eat something with twelve dollars now i was thinking of some hawker centres word i take bus from here what time bus is st margaret 708 or 703 you wait lah seven fifteen something make sure... there was one word  ok now one more time one more time again god is testing... from that day onwards i learned through my lesson too well word  that's not good you know not at all no sometimes i got so angry with my books or doing something can lah five more minutes five more minutes five more minutes five more minutes it's like one hour word  oh i must secure myself word especially now i think it's the lack yeah do you feel that yeah i feel... because nothing that books could actually fill up yeah i agree it is why ah i so desperately to go overseas i have to leave this... i have to leave and go somewhere and sit down... you want to follow me go where thailand cannot why not see i get so by people here understand i want to leave i want
