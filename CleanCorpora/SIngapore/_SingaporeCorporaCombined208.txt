thank you well this morning i think uh we can all be more relaxed because uh don't have any vips around here with us so uh feel easy and during the i'll try and uh restrain myself so that you can have some question time and during question time please feel free to ask questions go to the mic and ask them now uh some of you may have heard of me uh some may not my name is uh goh sin tub and uh because i have a tendency to write ghost stories uh the ghost lover of emerald hill ghost lover second edition and uh ghost of singapore and more ghost of singapore so my friends uh pull my leg and say that my initials stand for ghost story teller of course gst stands for something more horrible now uh actually how i came about writing ghost stories was that while i started off in an unguarded moment writing the story the ghost lover of emerald hill uhm that's about that's uhm uh about a haunted house that i remember from my childhood days uh it's a house in emerald hill and uh reporters from the press have been trying to get me to identify which house but being a developer or involved with development companies uh i do not want to disclose because it might uh lower the value of the house but in any case the house is no longer haunted uh it was haunted uh during the time when i was a kid and uh the ghost did scare away quite a number of families but ultimately the ghost lover came along and he solve the problem uh i shall be reading you some extracts later on on these stories which i have written but after i wrote the ghost lover of emerald hill my friends thought that uh i had become a kind of an expert in ghost stories so they kept on telling me their ghost stories their own ghost stories asking me to become their ghost writer as it were hence i discovered that i uh was quite popular with ghost of singapore and in fact the ghost of singapore sold so well that my publisher insisted i should come out with more ghost of singapore and this has been selling well too but uh it's rather a bad reputation so i'm trying to make a break away from ghost and uh i in the mean time have written another uh book called the nan mei-su girls of emerald hill these are some girls i knew uh when i was in emerald hill i stayed in emerald hill for the best part of my young youth uh when i was a child and when i was a young man and uh uh the nan mei-su girls were actually waitresses working in a in a japanese restaurant and many people confuse them with the prostitutes the uh uh who were use by the uh japanese army and uh of course when the uh story came out uh i had to keep on denying that they were prostitutes i was defending their honour when i was a kid because the neighbours always thought that they were bad girls but i i they were my friends and i knew they were not bad girls they were people who were earning a living and i find that fifty years later i am still defending their honour uh anyway uh what i propose to do this morning is just to uh illustrate the points which i am making with some extracts from the stories and perhaps even some some of the poems which i have written now before i go on i mustn't forget the title the title is to right or not to right - that is the question that is not the question in fact to write or not to write that is the question uh depends on how you spell write uh to right or not to right that is not a question in my mind because uh i don't think a writer should really be involved in an activist manner with issues if he wants to be actively involve he goes out and becomes a politician or a lawyer fighting a case or you know anybody that is trying to right a wrong so the writer should be more concern with whether he's to write and that's spelt with a double u to write or not to write that is the question to write or not to write uh if he has it in him and uh he can express it then he should write if he has it in him and cannot express it he should not write if he hasn't got it in him but can express whatever he hasn't got he still shouldn't write so to write or not to write that is the question double u to write or not to write that is the question and uh i think that uh writers have to be sure about these two aspects what he has in him what he can say ideas expression ideas expression these are the two two two main things uh you must have the ideas and you must know how to express them and these two make a writer the theme of this whole uhm conference is bridging worlds and i think uh my topic is particularly relevant in this respect because the writer's main role is really to bridge worlds he has something he wants to say and he has to bridge this world across to that world to the other world he has to be able to convey what is important to him what he thinks is worth expressing worth talking about worth letting other people people know and he ha to bridge worlds the main world being himself and the old rest of mankind so first task is bridge worlds and what what has he to offer he has what his perception of life the truths as he sees them the truths may come about in different ways it may be a young person under oppression because of the lack of understanding of the older folks somehow or other he he or she would want to put this across so that hopefully we pick up somewhere it'll help other some other people it could be uh the gap between not between generations but the gap between sexes it could be the gap between races the gap between religions there are many worlds that require bridging and i think a writer's decision whether to write or not to write should be based on whether he has got something to say and that he has he has the way to express it with regard to matters which would help to bridge worlds now this is talking in in very uh you know high faluting terms and so on well when it come down to uh more basic things you are really talking about uh maybe minor things or things which appear to be minor but can be very important uh so these things will come out in in in in in uh the various works uh that you write at one time when i started write write writing i found that uh uh one of my difficulties was really the lack of experience the lack of life experience uh but you make up for that in a way because you make up for that because you talk to people and if you develop that perception you'll begin to understand you get a second-hand experience you read you get a second-hand experience but for some people that second-hand hand experience is even more in depth and more meaningful than first-hand experience for for for other people you'll you will come across many people like that who would go through life you know experiencing something day after day but at the end of the of uh you know several years and decades and so on would really miss the point totally so it is intensity and the perception which you bring to bear on experience whether first-hand second-hand or third-hand that is important so don't be fazed in anyway don't be worried in anyway by lack of experience because you can make up for it in many ways expression that is a more difficult area that's an area where you have to sweat over you have to learn a lot you have to learn like reading you have to learn uh from the advice that you get from others and from your own trial and error and then you pick up you will find quite soon enough that if you start off if you have if you start off with humour you win a lot of people uh then if you want to be solemn and you want to talk about something which matters a lot something which is very sensitive uh has an emotional content then you're going to find it very difficult to it like this from me across to you in a big lecture hall like that you'll find it easier one on one uh you'll find it easier if it is when the group is smaller but still a writer has to do it not one on one but one on many because his book will be read by so many different people he's not going to scold everybody here many people that have been going to uh to uh not like what he has written that doesn't really matter he should accept that but if you are getting your message across you're bridging worlds that's what counts and sometimes uh you may only reach a minority but that minor minority may be the important minority so it doesn't matter you still have to write now let me uh give you some illustrations of things which i of things which i have written uh first of all to make my point of about uh humour this is a a story from the book the ghost lover of emerald hill and other stories and the title of the story is the curse of hylinmong it's about my grandfather and it's partly true but there is a lot of bullshit about it as well well there i was telling a story of introducing my grandfather but uh you see if you if you introduce humour take it along lightly uh you have a better chance or uh keeping the reader with you uh i have some friends who tell me that they like this part of the story but unfortunately they don't buy the book they just read it in the bookshops and put it back in the selves that's one of the hazards that uh writers will have to go through well there's that is an example of a light approach now let me uh read you a story which is a little bit more serious yes when i was uh round your age or so some fifty years ago that's how great our generation gap is uh it was the japanese occupation and uh i my schooling was interrupted and then i went to a japanese school and in that japanese school we learn the japanese language and japanese culture and a bit of that has remain in me and at one time we thought that we were the beginning of a new generation you know previously we were in a colonial situation under the british and now we were talking about the greater co-prosperity sphere of the japanese we were talking about japanese culture and we thought that we were you know going some places uh little did we know that uh because going to end so soon of course we we we also experience some of the atrocities and so on but there's another side to it and this is where a writer comes in  you you you you show that there are different facets to a situation even uh in a terrible time like the japanese occupation and let me read you a page from sayonara sinsei which is a a story in the ghost lover as well
