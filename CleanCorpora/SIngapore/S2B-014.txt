good evening the main reports tonight
""
""
the land transport select committee recommends ways to control
car growth
""
""
the philippine government gets more powers to investigate those
suspected of involvement in last month's coup attempt
""
""
and the politburo of rumania's communist party is arrested
""
""
we begin with a report by the select committee on land
transportation on ways to control the car population
""
one of its major recommendations is the introduction of the quota
system to ensure a target car population growth rate is maintained
""
the chairman of the committee dr hong hai explains
""
""
we think the quota system will work better because it set it
attains the target directly
""
it says four percent six percent growth whatever and uh allows the
market price to adjust to attain that level of growth
""
there are possibly some misapprehensions about what the quota
system will lead to
""
but first is the idea that somehow the quota system is going to
prevent many people from owning cars
""
this is totally untrue
""
under the quota system you could also go and buy a scrap car or you
could scrap your car and with the certificate you get buy a new car
""
so that doesn't change at all what has changed is what price you
pay to buy a new car when you don't have a scrap car to trade in right
""
in the past the price is fixed at the arf value in the future if
the quota system is implemented the price is going to depend on market
conditions at that time
""
we've advocated and i think it's most reasonable that the
government would would would uh go along that the quota should not be
something that is very secretive or very confidential
""
the government should be quite open to to allow people to
understand its rationale for whatever quota it is going to set whether it's
five percent six percent three percent whatever
""
let people know well in advance what it's likely to be so that
there is no uncertainty in the market so that dealers cannot go out and
spread rumours that oh next year it's going to be zero so you better buy your
car now
""
that sort of thing
""
we don't think therefore that the the government uh should be we
think the government should be open about it and therefore speculation
arising from uncertainty of the quota in the future would be minimum
""
""
the committee also said the present parf scheme should be
retained for all existing vehicles
""
but for newly registered cars the scheme can be refined so that
cars disposed of earlier will get a better value
""
as for the evening area licensing scheme the committee has asked
for it to end half an hour earlier at six thirty
""
it also suggested further studies on the effectiveness and need for
an evening als
""
on parking charges the committee said the rate should reflect the
social  word  the city and congested areas
""
but car-park prices in housing estate(s  should not be determined
by traffic control objectives as it had only a minor impact
""
as for public transport the committee believes there may be a case
for granting capital subsidies to feeder services for the mrt
""
it also said improvements for road transport should continue to
meet the people's aspirations to own cars
""
a special program on the report by the select committee will be
telecast after the news on this channel

all the major organizations indian organizations in singapore
are cultural sporting or otherwise will in some way be be involved

red and silver as its logo
