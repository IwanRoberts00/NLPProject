most of his honours friends he can't really can't say anything for them in in august and july uh huh uh huh ya i see uhm uhm well uhm but the permanent teacher and the principal hasn't mentioned anything to me you see uhm uhm so it's like kind of thick skin if i were to ask them uhm actually i met sim lyn the other day uh huh uhm i was down at mph and she was with mike and she was buying a wedding card uh have you seen her recently no do you know that she's cut her hair really short that's what she's been telling me that by the time i see her i think it wouldn't be that short any more uh huh and she was saying that mike doesn't like it that much and prefers  word  really he or rather no what she actually said was oh uhm ya he he says he can't really get used to it and she said something to the effect of people prefer the previous length so by inference i took it that he didn't like it that much oh i thought he liked it and i thought she said he liked it i can't remember uhm anyway it's very very fresh-looking but very i don't know i still liked her with even-length hair see when i asked her she said she looked like su ya that's about word you know uh huh ya so that was when i really imagined it off the ears uhm uhm uhm oh did you know that i cut mine you mean since i saw you at at the sso uh huh and i told you i was going to cut it oh gosh so you cut it word  uh huh it's the shortest i've ever had oh no is it layered or is it even-length uhm it's well i'm trying to keep it all over again so it's it's levelled up to half my chin length and then it's a gradual slope down oh i see half my chin length uhm well it's you know what that means right i think i know what that means uhm uhm uh uhm oh dear aye it happened a mixed bag of reactions the the those who need it ones after the cut uh came from those who liked it then after a while those who kept quiet are usually those who liked long hair and the boys oh i see your students uhm uhm uhm uhm the girls oh so nice cut and the boys switched off and cut your hair uh why uhm at first i was so proud you know i went i went and i looked at my sec two boys and i said at that time it was their exam so i said

monday so i don't have to pay so many days oh okay uh huh uhm uhm you're going to be around i'm going to be around today  word  yes and after that i really can't say uhm uhm uhm uhm oh i hear from sharlene you're going to the london  word ballet oh yes that oh that means she's been in the room uh huh because you know i've got two tickets to word uh huh uh huh because i i i got thirty dollar tickets and forty dollar tickets so i thought it's easier to sell off the thirty dollar tickets and so i put up a notice on the board in the room oh you mean you you made a duplicated word meaning i bought i had four tickets and i only needed two oh dear yes well you can try kumu she's kind of idle right now oh does she like ballet do you like ballet yes i do um ah but when is it uh this is the twenty-eighth of june oh so i'll be around eh uhm uhm uh huh how much oh thirty uhm oh that's a thought it's up in the circle uhm one of my friends told me it's okay seats uh huh uhm i'll be going with andrew on the same night oh on the same night but different seats yes uhm uhm just different seats uhm and uhm ya it's at kallang it's at eight pm oh it's the romeo and juliet one uhm yes i was more attracted to the next bill oh yes the one with transfigured night but i think those are completely sold out uh huh ya uhm uhm i thought it would be uhm we tried the only one my friends tried to get was the dallas symphony oh and tried to get oh okay tried to get and then for the rest of it i thought oh give it a skip  uhm uhm uhm i was talking to another friend who was telling me oh he's going to see the indonesian dance uhm uhm in the gamallon and nuh he was saying and he was saying that ya these are the tickets that are more available then he says singaporeans are so snobbish uh and i kind of shrivelled in my feet no uhm it's not that singaporeans are snobbish that i think those who are trained to those who go to ballets and all uhm uhm and music halls they're all western classically-trained so so i i think not exposed enough to indigenous cultural works you know uhm uhm ya and well uhm uhm did i tell you once i went i went with my entire bible study group to the glass orchestra the glass orchestra uh huh and because it's some um experimental group and highly experimental and i kind of knew uhm that i forgot you see so i said 'why don't we all go ' and i booked tickets for all of them and they almost died because oh because the trained ones uh two most accomplished ones almost died because it's like nothing orchestral that they know it was that spaced out uh huh uhm and like 'what orchestra ' it's all broken pieces of glass oh that's why it's called the glass orchestra ya so it's like actually they tried to pattern um the the the glass instruments um most of which were fashioned themselves they tried to to group them into the different sectors you know like the conventional orchestra uhm uhm according to i don't know the pitch or something uhm and their works were original too so you've got to like throw away all the conventional ways of listening and listen according to rhythm you know uhm uhm and i found it very interesting because i could pick out when one movement ended or one piece ended and another girl who's like absolutely tone-deaf sometimes and she's not trained you see and she's not very exposed and she knew when it ended but the musician friends of mine my goodness they just went 'to hell with it' was it bad wasn't it enjoyable um it's enjoyable if you listen to it with a different ear uhm so they were going 'i like brahms so what am i doing ' oh poor things ya but i was quite mad actually because it's like you're you're just cloistered you know instead of broadening uhm uhm well uh different different ideas and i think all that talk all that reading up on post-modernism help uhm uhm uhm ya by uhm by the way ya this is a recorded conversation ya i figured ya by the sound word she's going to have a lot of giggles cos' it's something as natural as it can get i can't i can't i can't control it oh same here ya i kind of word  how in the world do you transcribe giggles do you just skip them or do you put in bracket giggle ya wow wee she's going to have a lot of brackets wow okay like in the middle of a sentence
