why did they revert back to the end of year exam i i really don't know end of semester kind of exams right it was end of term at first right what she's not supposed to say anything oh oh i really hadn't the faintest idea why ya terrible why why are we expected to put all our eggs in one basket what happen if we drop the basket and break all our eggs why is it why did you decide to do linguistics is it no he's taking arts ya i mean i just applied and i got the place maybe you should do your honours first and come back again maybe i should go overseas and never come back singapore is so terrible you must do reservist this this that aiyoh now i think i must really think first of migrating you know maybe i should uh submit my application even though it costs five hundred sing dollars to submit an application for australia but i think i'll i think that five hundred dollars is a good investment but the the relevant people may not be listening in okay so there's no point going on but i think if lim pin get out of nus uhm i think they might actually change the system he's obsolete is that what they call the observer's paradox what one of my uh lecturers in s p believe she said what can they what can they test a post-graduate student in three hours is it a fair test well perhaps true they're testing memory power rather than understanding actually that's quite true a lot about honoured you know undergrads memory powers those who can remember better but sometimes it's the facts you remember how you apply it in your answer you see but then i think it's postgraduate level it's more like research methodology rather than but then you should it by then you should do it by by thesis thesis how many words ten thou ten thousand for honours thirty i think okay thirty thirty that means only ten thousand words more you don't have the twenty not thirty twenty twenty i think it's twenty thousand no twenty is by course work is it i can't remember course work is twenty plus your nine units twenty k plus nine units so how to word  oh you mean yours you intend to do it for three years no no no it's fifteen months everything is crammed in three weeks so last time they had term last time they had last time they had term one i i i think i'm i'm quite awake now and then you take exams and you finish it finish with it ya ya ya ya ya everything is at the end you see ya accumulated so what is your area of research bilingualism and uh maybe i'll i'll look into either codeswitching or uhm how bilingual how the i mean we all differ in our speech of bilingualism is it too noisy it is too noisy rather noisy so how never mind i think try lah either that or we can rush through lunch worse worse worse after worse worse comes to worse we'll meet again for lunch maybe you should put this uh near your registrar's table and then tape and see what he says or go to her room or what you can do is rush through lunch and then go to her room and talk but you can't really rush through the chicken rice it's pretty good i can help you with it no you eat your salad and keep quiet so rude uh this fellow how is siew teng uhm tze peng tze peng how you pronounce word  ya tze tzy tzy is he happy at n p b ya he's happily married too to whom aye i like your card where did you buy it oh i'm sorry we're not supposed to reveal such things it's very nice because the edge has a book mark ya i have ya so you can tear it off so you can send send it back to her no it's on my table now no why why do so many people leave uh unlike uh four o one anthea doesn't leave she's like entrenched i think she's the only one who can teach that course or is willing to teach that course what course is that history of eng historics of english history of english historics ya it's a paper that will fail so you word the origins of english it's compulsory it's a core course compulsory course for honours year it's like word and word  are completely different but but he did it for his i didn't do that it's one of the i mean you can choose lah i didn't choose that an elective ha history of english in australia is an elective oh you did it in australia no it's not it's not elective it's like you have got a number of units to choose from so i wouldn't if it's really elective none of our courses are core courses so like we have got a number of topics we can just choose quite flexible ya ours we had to use standard english right for transcription and things like that uhm ya ours not necessary theirs no need you know but you where where did you do your u w a university of western australia oh u w a actually if you come into contact with these uh foreign lecturers they're actually very flexible they're not that particular because they all believe that you have been word  but the irony is that most of our lecturers are foreign lecturers in the lang department no it's it's policy over here yeh ya it's policy but sometimes also their style also word formal with their is certainly a style what i don't think it has anything to do with policies i can't i can't think of any locals where is she from a british lah just right behind you that floral the bluish floral dress back facing to you actually you know what i would like to study as a masters research something like uhm whether singaporean english is singaporean should be better classed as singaporean chinese english because i believe the malays and the indians speak singlish in a very different way malays yes but i think indians are more difficult to discern you know i mean distinguish but it depends it depends it it depends also it depends on their cultural context of course you get a very typical indian suh they will sound very indian right if you get those those those uhm less traditional usually like the christians and all that they are more modern yes yes yes ah like yourself lah ya do you know whether they'll then do a comparison you can ask me maybe i know you won't know what are you sure the bridging course started already started i told theresa ask theresa anyway it ends it ends in april i think march or april i'm trying to skip word  is is tzy peng applying for p r again he's a he's a p r but didn't he doesn't want a citizenship but he doesn't have to where singapore or australia here here here ya lah don't want nah what for not worth staying here i knew he doesn't want to do his doesn't have to do his national service now yeh if he but if he gets a citizenship no he doesn't have to oh really how come how old is he twenty-eight i thought he might still be liable you know because that wasn't one of the conditions when they offered him ya lah if not people won't take up citizenship what he doesn't want to take up anywhere because being a p r married to a singaporean there's nothing he need to he only gets to vote other than that he gets an increase lah ya and vote for what everytime p a p also win one have you ever tried the chicken rice here no have you ever
