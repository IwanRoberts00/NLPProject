thank you mister chairman well i'm not going to talk about you know sexual problems or things like that tonight but uhm the talk is actually on stress management strategy and uh i shall make it a very practical session so afterwards you know you all will have to have maybe you space yourself out and shift the chairs a little because you will need some room we're going to uh go through a few of the techniques and there are different types uhm i shan't be doing too much theory but i thought you know perhaps you know i'll just have this one transparency we talk about stresses and the general concept of stress so basically you know there's for any individual lah you have the stressor the stressor can be anything depends on each person it could be your family your marriage your work relationship anything you know that stresses you we call the stressor and then you know you go to this uh through different interfaces with one self and with that person himself so first you have got the appraisal how you look at stress or maybe you look at the situation let's say you've got an exam uhm or you know your husband is going to leave you or your work in office due to over work and all that how do you appraise it and appraisal maybe it depends on how you look at things some things you see as unpleasant some things are challenging some things are threatening and this depends on lots of other factors you know on what that has happen in the past you know how you face the si stimulus situation how you face exams or how you face work stress or how you face you know quarrel with your husband that sort of things so and it depends on also your knowledge you know knowledge about a certain thing how much you think you know about the situation as subject in a way you've experience of it your judgement of it you know you're judging it and as you know being serious not too serious moderately serious is it okay it's not too bad and all that uh then things like you know how predictable it is lah if it's something that comes on in a very predictably and you know the outcome you know what's going to be like then your reaction is going to be different as from something that just comes out of the blue if it's terrible it's your fault and then you know you don't have anything to guide you and there's a situation what's the situation surrounded surrounding this uh ? ? this uh stress at the moment okay so this one uh is going to then you look at the outcome uh what you expect of the outcome uh you think it's going to be a good outcome or bad outcome so probably you know we do that lah most of the time but probably we don't have it in a structure but you generally like some sort of expectation i think it's terrible suppose to be collapsing soon uh i will not be able to survive it and then it's going to be so bad i think i better end my life so that will become someone expecting the worse outcome well you think well perhaps it's not so bad that type of thing then uhm you look at the you know efficacy of expectations uh whether you think you know how efficacious uh certain things are going to be you know what strategies what you're going use and whether it's going to be useful or not and the commitments that you have uhm in relation to that stress uh what commitments do you have to that situation and that will help you decide you know because your options are going to give them what commitment you have if you are overly committed or heavily committed then you may be able to you may be unable to you know have the option of leaving that stress or that stressful situation now other things will be on your personality and here a lot of work has been done so uhm you all may have heard of the type a and type b type of personality there has been a lot of work done and initially it was use you know almost about uh two three decades ago about you know cardiac disorders you know cardiac disorders and the type a type of personality so that you know it was represented with a clench fist and a and a stopwatch uh if they say those who are most prone to mild cardiac problems lah uh let's say infarctions heart attacks and all that they're the ones who are very very tense they're very ambitious they are very impatient and uh they have to do things all the time on the go and that's why you have this clench fist and suggesting a lot of tension inner tension and also the stop watch a stop watch has seen a lot of singaporeans and a stop watch in their minds that means everything must be done on time if the thing is a bit slow uhm certain things happen they become very frustrated and they're very uptight about it so this is the type a personality and it was found that within type a personality you are prone to uhm cardiac problems but now in the whole context has been widen so that they look at this personality and gastric ulcer this personality and a lot of variety of things so basically if you do have that part if you can uh then you can change it uh preferably to the type b personality type b is the opposite of it you're very laid back you don't care till you know sky can come down and say well it's not too bad and all that so gives him a very laid back type of personality and probably in terms of the singapore context if you're too type b again i suppose it's not too good okay but anyway this is the personality type that you have and the other one is the locus of control again a lot of work has been done well this uh control basically means that a situation happens how much are you in control of it can you control or you can't control it okay whether let's say uhm examinations can you control the outcome or not generally i think where exams are concerned ah we have quite a good locus of control basically i mean if you have uhm let's say sufficient you have the intellectual level and you know you know you study hard and you go through the past question your chances of passing should be about ninety per cent there'll be ten per cent chance of failing you may not do you may not reach a but your chances of passing are good so your locus of control is good but suppose you know you go into a situation where the external locus of your control is an external locus of control that means you're working in a situation where you have a very erratic boss everything depends on him he's very high-sailing but he's very erratic and you don't know where you stand you have to look at the face one day he's happy the other day he's not so he gives you that type of stress it can be very bad i think of some people those who have been in the army sometimes you know you face uh uh a difficult ? ? he may give you hell because you may not be able to predict it's totally out of your control so in that situation you can feel very helpless and the stress can be great and another thing at the end a lot of work being done on social support what we know is that the more support you have the better you are able to cope so let's say now the stressor you go through this and then you look at your coping strategies ah there are different types of coping strategies one is problem focus one is emotion focus we'll go through the strategies later and that depends your outcome depends on that if it's a bad outcome you will get your either psychological problem uh into well i was talking suicidal behaviour and all that and even you know while it was mention sexual disorders uhm you can get physical problems and physical problems can be anything because uh lots of things are actually in a way the relationship between strength and ailment there are several what we call psychosomatic disorders that means you're quite related to stress and others which are a bit more diffused ah but again a lot of work is being done on that or if you have been all these factors are good then your outcome can be satisfactory right so this is uh a basic uhm outcome of the concept of stress and now we will go straight into the management strategy i shall be dealing you know with uh two of these and not all of them now these are the general ones as in relaxation hypnosis and imagery and tonight i would like to cover it and then later on we go onto the more cognitive ones how do you change your way of thinking so the first one is uh is relaxation therapy and uhm perhaps you know if you can do now can you all shift around uh so that you have enough space uh to be able to stick your legs out now the issue of relaxation therapy is that you know you have to learn how to relax and you have to relax your muscles ah so this one is what we call the peripheral method meaning that you know the theory is that if your muscles are relaxed you're going to be able to relax okay some people will find that you know it is so if they relax muscles then they can relax themselves but some people may not be able to do that and that's why we have you know different other techniques later on okay so initially this was started by jacobson?? in the nineteen thirties and uh what he said was like i said the principle was that if you relax your muscles then your whole mind will relax many people find that they cannot tell whether their muscles are tense or relax lah so what we did was have a series of exercises which focus uh on tension that allow you to then you know what it means when your muscles are tense and what that means when your muscles are relaxed so what i shall do is now i would like all of you to now just tense your muscles really grip hard and tense everything clench you know clench your your legs and then your hands and bite as you know really hard really hard and as you do that focus fully on your body focus on the tension of your legs your arms your teeth and all that really tense tense tense tense now relax just relax and as you relax just focus on your muscles how it feels when they are relaxed so this one is very important because this is uh something you got to learn about your body how it feels ah to be tense and how it feels to be relaxed what i shall do is to go through the whole series and what we'll be doing is to tense and relax you know different muscle groups as you tense and relax just focus on that part and don't tense or relax the other parts so if i say the feet ah just tense your feet and so on and so don't just focus on that  and uh try to get a system because obviously this is something if you want to use you've got to practice lah
