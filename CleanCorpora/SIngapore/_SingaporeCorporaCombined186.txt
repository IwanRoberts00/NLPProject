we certainly hope that they could uh uh put this behind them and uh proceed with the semi-pro league and uh come out with uh flying colours tonight well sarawak had the first throw in of the game and their attack at singapore defence straight away michael vana trying to latch onto the loose ball which was actually a very poor pass laid on by haslim harun then and that's abdullah bohan back in singapore colours you wouldn't expect him to play at the start of the season especially when midel scavachek opted for stoppers instead in of full back but he's back that's noor halis also in the starting line up tonight a quick ball forward and a nice header down there by haslim to kannan kannan got the better of uh evans only for awhile and it's a goal kick to sarawak k kannan who hasn't scored in this semi-pro league yet i'm sure he'd would gladly love to open his word  uh his accounts tonight and start a scoring spree for singapore and the last time of course he's scored at the national stadium was last season but for a different team for kuala lumpur and that goal knocked singapore out of the malaysia cup proper john hunter climbing so very well for that one he pits a real wallop in his shots john hunter and he's out to prove he is what the papers have uh put him out to be a proven goal scorer auyong how would you uh what would you think of and what would you do if you're faced with an opponent like john hunter well uhm uh looking at him he's big and hefty i would imagine that uh tong hai should always uh get between uh him and his goal in order to have uhm some uh head start especially when the ball is still behind tong hai but i think uh tong hai being uh very young and uh energetic i think he's uh he will do a good job from uh john hunter this evening michael vana another one of the surging runs into the opposition penalty area devaraj couldn't control the ball well enough he was dropped for the game against negri sembilan but he is back to prove that he is first eleven material and he's scored in the first game against trenggannu he's trying to weave past his defenders again he does well but the goal-keeper had no problems in catching the ball maslan won it he's had no problem so far maslan wahid but he well looking at the the way sarawak played last season he's a little suspect when it comes to the high balls but then again when you uh cross the ball into the penalty area you've got jeff current there to cut all the loose balls out for sarawak hunter asking for the ball he wants it placed right at his head but it's vana who hits the ball clear only as far as jeff current razali said an aimless fall that time aiming just to clear it instead of uh passing it to a fellow team mate of his and this is haslim harun back in defence good play here by singapore papanathan vana sent tumbling down there by the sarawak defender there razali singapore players knocking the ball around very confidently but of course the fans would love to see the boys knocking the ball that way in the opposition's half instead of their own half but they're building slowly and steadily right into the half of the orange shirted players vana back to abdullah bohan  word left pull by abdullah bohan very nice indeed to see him back again in the national team here i mean uhm so far uh singapore has been uh trying to uh uh build up the play word  i carry on from auyong has uh michael vana took his first attempted goal and a very good one as well and brought it down the ball down very well after a good lay out by k kannan but that was a good save indeed by the goal-keeper the shot didn't carry too much power but still mazan wahid got down to the ball well good shot by vana as you were saying auyong right i i would imagine that uh singapore is doing uh they're very cautious at the moment they're playing the ball uh to the feet and uh they're attempting to penetrate the middle but i would imagine that uh having a tall defenders like dave evans and uh uh in the middle they should uh try and use more of the flanks to uh send the ball in uh for our meaty uh forward uh kannan and devaraj vana again vanar on the move good play by michael vana what a start again and he's just won't stop scoring would he the fans just love him right here and five minutes gone by singapore are already leading by one goal to nil and that would go down at one of the greatest malaysia cup goals ever scored by a singapore player he got the ball from haslim and he cut in from almost thirty metres out he let three defenders in his wake and just slotted the ball into the nets to give singapore the start at their grand top and that kind of start that coach p m sivagy had ask for what do you see of the goal auyong that was a brilliant by uh vana indeed he uh he took the ball and uh he managed to uh weave his way pass a couple of defenders in the middle before the slotting the ball in i think that was a classic piece of uh move by vana and look at that wonderful shooting wonderful control of the ball and so cool when it comes through the final touch it is fifth goal of the competition and he's way ahead at the top-scorer the goal top goal getter of the year award kannan with a nice back heel to malek kawoff malek standing up to his opposition very well but jeff current is little too tall for devaraj i don't think devaraj can actually saw that ball perfect into the penalty box at all let's see the goal from this lovely angle auyong ya well uh it's a a really uh brilliantly struck uh left footer into the uh left bottom corner of the net uh well credit must certainly be given to uh uh vana he did really well there oh in case you just saw the instant replay from the back of the nets let me tell you that it was vana who scored the goal you couldn't really see him scoring it but it was him who started goal passed maslan wahid it's still there by effendi julaihim and here's vana again look at him go a ball cut inside well served to kannan and here's vana faced with the australian defender good skill by devaraj good turn now to haslim and jeff current doing all he can a little bit messy it might be but he did all he can to prevent haslim and kannan to word doing up something for singapore again and the boys are really swarming and launching weight after weight at the sarawak defence aren't they ya they suddenly uh are doing that and uh if they mount and continued to uh treasure the the sawarakian defence i'm sure we'll see a second goal very soon uh mark the fans down here certainly hope they do vana a lovely pull back then a good word inside but well cleared by david evans good ball by noor halis shafik one advantage of having noor halis shafik to the back liners that he provides all the uh ground skills whereas the other two tong hai and papanathan provide the aerial skills uh yes indeed uh shafik has always been a very uh tough player oh so close razali said who threatened to score a few goals from outside the box against trengganu almost got the shot on target and gave singapore a two goal cushion in the first ten minutes of the match ya yes indeed razali said indeed packs a a real wallop in both his feet and uh it will certainly be a pleasure if you could see another of his uh replays uh in the previous games john hunter very difficult to shake him off the ball indeed all hundred kilograms of the big man the big sarawakian in fact he's an australian playing in sarawak pama cut that one out easily not convincingly but good enough to prevent that sarawak way from turning word  here is razali said he's given the role of orchestrating the move from mid-field tonight and he's certainly did very then on that part on that time that occasion but malek kawak was not allowed to pump a good cross into the sarawak penalty box although it was illegal a bad tackle then by mohammud dalan and a free kick for singapore in a very dangerous position razali said behind the ball michael vana it's the head that he'll be looking for mazlan wahid he's not very confident well with vana scoring a goal in the fifth minute of play earlier and we don't expect mazlan to be most confident person in the world at the moment it's a stadium packed to the fullest at least fifty thousand people here tonight and they've had a a lot to cheer about after only ten minutes of play gone by but i'm sure they will want more from the singapore team sarawak trying to regain their composure which they showed in the early stages of the match i'm sure it was definitely shattered that was michael vana he's reading his way round the defence so easily and putting the ball at the back of the sarawak net only five minutes of play gone by haslim who had just taken position of the ball abdullah bohan here is malek singapore boys practising patience in their build up devaraj and a chase for the ball with uh david evans and uh devaraj did enough to shake david evans off the ball to win a throw in for singapore vana he's got two players polis policing him but he gets the ball in time to kannan and devaraj didn't lift the ball high enough to get the ball pass evan's head noor halis noor halis shafik good play by noor halis he's got support from vana and he uses it vana down to devaraj then to kannan he saw some sheer tugging then by dave evans which the referee also saw and they didn't escape the referee's eyes then so it's a free kick at the edge of the sarawak box we've got about uhm just about twenty metres outside the penalty box and we've seen vana striking he's struck a very good shot against trenggannu which just sailed over the bar and i'm sure he might want to do better in a situation like this now kannan is also behind the ball but kannan heads it straight at the ball vana with the second bite of the apple and all the way back for singapore to do some defending tong hai lost a little ball control then tong hai a little bit off his balance but then of course it's much better for him to clear the ball into the sarawak half and leave it to the sarawak players uh to build up from their very own half than to clear it in his own half and uh put singapore under some pressure hunter oh that's some confidence morale boosting effect on uh lim tong hai ahead of one against john hunter malek t papanathan haslim he's got some space here to try he which he does but his shots just uh wasn't suited for a goal calibre and i'm sure that haslim he himself would have hoped for a better shot  auyong how have you see the match gone by thirty minutes of play gone by and uh how how is the match gone by in your opinion
