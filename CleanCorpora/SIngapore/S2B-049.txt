""
the year 1990 will long be remembered as a special year by
singaporeans the university and of course by you the new graduates
""
for singaporeans it marks the silver jubilee of our nationhood and
25 years of successful unrelenting efforts at nation-building
""
for the university it signifies 10 years of extraordinary growth and
development following the merger of our two predecessor universities
""
and for the new graduates it means the crowning glory of 16 years of
formal education and launching into the exciting world of work
""
together they call for jubilant celebrations and all three are
actually related
""
a prosperous singapore has provided the necessary support for the
university galvanised by the merger to offer the quality education which
amply prepares graduates to take on the challenges that lie ahead of them
""
and the success of the well-prepared graduates in turn helps to
sustain and enhance the prosperity of singapore itself
""
thus completing the circle of happy relationships
""
the success of graduates in the world of work does depend on
opportunities which are determined to a large extent by the state of the
country's economy
""
as our national economy has remained sound opportunities for work
are plentiful for our graduates
""
i expect the great majority if not all of you are already gainfully
employed
""
as engineers you are particularly in great demand because industry
has become increasingly high-tech and knowledge-intensive as it develops and
industrial r&d is fast gathering momentum
""
in fact market forces have conspired to place engineers in the
ranks of top earners among the new graduates
""
with the recent upturn in the construction industry there is now
even talk of shortage of good civil engineers in the profession
""
these buoyant features of our economy however should not blind us
to our vulnerability to rapid unexpected changes in the world at large as
recent events in the middle east have again shown
""
graduates while rightly committed to training for their chosen
careers should always remain alert and mentally nimble
""
and be prepared to adapt to re-learn and to meet unfamiliar
challenges
""
for the latter i am confident your university education will stand
you in good stead
""
you have been equipped with an inquiring analytical mind capable of
innovation and independent learning
""
and you should be ready to make your mark in society under any
condition
""
in the first 10 years of its existence nus itself has successfully
met new demands and thrived on fresh challenges
""
to support the targeted ambitious socio-economic growth of our
nation the university has had to produce quality manpower in sufficient
numbers
""
over this period undergraduate enrolment in the university has
increased by some 80 per cent from 8,634 to 15,298
""
to maintain and enhance the quality of education teaching staff has
more than doubled from 602 to 1,389
""
and various schemes and measures such as student feedback on
teaching and courses consultation with faculty advisory committees seminars
and workshops on teaching skills adjunct teaching appointments from outside
the university compulsory practical training and computer-based learning have
been introduced
""
creativity and innovation have been nurtured through challenging
projects and open-ended experiments in the laboratories
""
while the recently introduced optional enrichment courses broaden
the intellectual horizon
""
the favourable outcome is reflected in the high regard with which
nus degrees are held by professional bodies internationally by employers and
by other universities
""
the increasing sophistication and the high technology thrust of our
economic development have brought about a growing demand for more specialised
manpower
""
this has been matched by a four-fold increase in the postgraduate
enrolment in the university from 536 to 2,241 over the last 10 years
""
of the 671 postgraduates pursuing masters' or phds by research
about three quarters are in engineering medicine and science indicating that
a thriving research culture particularly in these disciplines has developed
in the context of the increasing importance of r & d to our economy
""
the establishment of iss in 1981 imcb in 1987 and the several
research centres for other subjects have markedly reinforced the research
culture
""
staff research output has increased more than three-fold with
significantly higher percentage of publications appearing in journals
included in the science and social sciences citation indices
""
research efforts have focused on certain chosen niches and
important break-throughs have been achieved
""
backed by its large body of experts and its comprehensive and
up-to-date facilities and equipment
""
the university has in the last 10 years rapidly stepped up
collaboration with industry and outside organisations in r & d and
commercialisation of research findings
""
as well as in providing consultation services transferring
technology and organising specialist up-date courses
""
in addition the faculties have held frequent lectures and seminars
on practical topics and issues to which interested parties outside the
university were invited
""
these seminars often multidisciplinary in nature and involving
several faculties have proved very popular and fruitful
""
the last 10 years have also seen a healthy growth in another aspect
of university life
""
regular lunch-time performances of music dance and drama which
commenced in 1985
""
art exhibitions the expanded activities of the centre for musical
activities and the recently opened lee kong chian art museum have all
contributed to bringing about a culturally vibrant campus
""
another important development in the last decade has been the
strengthening of bonds between the alumni and their alma mater
""
enhanced by the establishment of alumni affairs office in 1988 and
its programmes of activities
""
the university has grown very fast and clearly made significant
gains in the first 10 years as nus
""
it is natural at this juncture to pause and ponder how the
university should develop in the next 10 years
""
the mission remains one of supporting the nation's social and
economic development by producing the needed high-level manpower and by
promoting research and innovation
""
it sets the intellectual tone for the society and serves as a rich
resource of information and expertise for nation building
""
there is the need to respond to the changing demands as singapore
make its way towards the status of a developed nation
""
undergraduate course structure and content will continue to be
reviewed regularly
""
new subjects and courses will be introduced to meet emerging needs
""
for example the science faculty which has introduced two subjects
this year namely cell and molecular biology and development & systems biology
will offer materials science and computational science next year
""
the faculty of arts & social sciences will introduce mass
communication and european studies next year
""
greater flexibility will be incorporated in the degree and course
structures such that the best and brightest will be able to realise their
full potential
""
growth will take place mainly in postgraduate enrolment to meet the
expected demand for more specialist manpower in the economy
""
new postgraduate programmes will be introduced when needed
""
every effort will be made to increase the enrolment of postgraduate
research students from whom our nation's r & d manpower are derived
""
the availability of well-trained r & d manpower in sufficient
numbers is as we know critical to our further economic growth
""
the postgraduate school of engineering recently established to
spearhead the expansion of postgraduate programmes in engineering aims to
double the postgraduate research student enrolment to 500 by 1995
""
comparable rates of expansion in the enrolment of research students
are expected in other disciplines particularly in science and medicine
""
there will be a corresponding increase in research activities on
the campus
""
this will be reflected in the establishment of the clinical
research centre the institute of microelectronics and the centre for advanced
legal studies within the next two years
""
collaboration with industry will be further intensified especially
in joint r & d programmes and in the economic exploitation of the fruits of
research
""
information technology and biotechnology have been identified as
two important pillars of our economic development
""
the university will continue to play a key role in these areas
""
the bioprocessing technology unit recently established in the
department of chemical engineering converts laboratory results in molecular
biology into commercial entities
""
the national supercomputing resource centre soon to be set up by
the university combined with the campus-wide state-of-the-art computing
network which is optical-fibre based and the largest in the asia pacific
region will provide the optimal environment for r&d in information technology
""
implicit in the above plans and measures is the objective of making
nus a world class university building on the sound foundation already laid
down
""
this will complement singapore's march towards being a developed
nation
""
the existing campus facilities planned and constructed mainly in
the 70's will be upgraded and extended so that they are not only functional
""
but also aesthetically pleasing and bearing a distinctive character
that reflects the history and heritage of the university
""
a concert hall theatre of international standard will be built
incorporating a museum and a visual art centre to provide a centre for
performing and fine art on the campus
""
this will further enrich the cultural life of the university and
ensure a more rounded education
""
three additional halls of residence will also be built to provide
for at least one year of on-campus residence for every undergraduate
""
a master planner for this major campus-wide project has been
appointed and a concept plan is expected to be ready by the end of the year
""
the physical facilities should ultimately be of a standard
befitting a world-class university
""
for the graduates there is much about your alma mater that you can
be proud of and there is more to expect in the offing
""
a proud alumnus is one who feels he has a stake in the future of
his alma mater
""
and the best universities in the world for example the ivy league
universities are those which receive strong regular support from their proud
alumni
""
as the saying goes 'a university is only as great as its alumni
want it to be'
""
nus is no exception
""
as it moves up the scale of excellence the need for support from
its alumni will become increasingly obvious
""
we have therefore got to start to work on providing this support
""
setting up an endowment fund as suggested by our minister dr tony
tan would be a good start
""
this is being seriously looked into
""
the alumni affairs office will liaise with you on this matter in
due course
""
meanwhile your ideas and suggestions are most welcome
""
i am confident that the alumni of which you are already a part are
now ready to do their utmost for their alma mater
""
their loyalty and attachment to the university coupled with their
sense of gratitude will move them to help make their alma mater even better
than what they themselves had known it to be
""
in conclusion i would like to take this opportunity to wish all of
you the very best in the pursuit of your careers ahead of you
""
you may have left the campus but you are still very much a part of
the greater nus community
""
do visit the campus and take part in the wide variety of alumni
activities if only to remind yourselves that learning should not cease with
graduation from the university
""
learning is a life-long adventure to be courted and relished always
""
to those who are receiving their first degree scrolls this year the
job market continues to beckon with many exciting opportunities
""
the demand for graduates in the economy remains strong and new
graduates of the university are known to be keen capable and hardworking
""
they will have the opportunity to put to good use what they have
learnt in the university
""
it will soon become apparent to the new graduates that except for
colleagues from the professional faculties working in professional firms or
institutions
""
not all the knowledge and skills learnt as undergraduates will find
direct application in the workplace
""
one skill however stands out
""
without exception it makes all the difference to the effectiveness
of the new graduate at his new job
""
this is the skill of independent learning the ability to acquire
on one's own new knowledge and skills needed for one's job
