good evening
""
the people's action party led by mr goh chok tong who assumed
premiership just ten years ago was returned to power when nominations closed
at twelve thirty p.m. today
""
it's the ninth successive victory for the pap in the general
election
""
our special report tonight give detail gives details of the
walkovers and fights in the constituencies the major statements of party
leaders at their press conferences and finally an analysis of the issues by
three political commentators
""
no one could have expected the general election so soon in fact the
opposition calls it the snappiest of snap election but mr goh says he wants
an endorsement now for his style of government and his program
""
he says he is the issue and the ground is sweet
""
well who will be contesting who has already won what's the score
like at the end of nomination day
""
""
the pap has a lot to cheer about its mr goh chok tong's first
general election as prime minister and he says this is  word
 number of candidates since 1980
""
by the time the nominations closed at noon today the pap has fielded
eighty-one candidates and the opposition parties thirty-eight
""
seven independents will also be vying for a seat in the new
parliament making a total of one hundred and twenty-six this election
""
of the five opposition parties in the red this year the singapore
democratic party has nine candidates the workers' party thirteen the national
solidarity party eight the singapore malay national organisation or pkms four
and the singapore justice party four
""
the total number of opposition candidates this election is
forty-five down from seventy-five in 1988 and fifty-one in 1984
""
this turn of events has given the pap a large number of walkovers
forty-one
""
in terms of wards ten out of the fifteen grcs and one out of the
twenty-one single seats have been captured by the ruling party even before
the hustling have begun
""
in other words almost fifty percent of the registered voters do not
have to go to the polls
""
as pre-nomination speculation had predicted the opposition parties
have avoided putting up a strong challenge in the grcs
""
with the new requirement for four candidates in each grc one of
whom must be a member of a minority group it looks like the opposition has
decided they'll have better chances in the single member wards instead
""
twelve ministers were returned unopposed they include senior
minister lee kuan yew
""
for the first time he's running with three other candidates in the
expanded tanjong pagar grc
""
deputy prime minister ong teng cheong also had a walkover in toa
payoh grc
""
""
we're disappointed i'm sure all our supporters here are
disappointed we're all ready for a fight for a contest
""
""
yes ang mo kio grc has now gone to the people's action party
and the hundreds of supporters here are just screaming over with excitement
""
bg lee who picked up one of the highest votes in the last election
is positively elated
""
i'm going to try to break through the crowd to get a response from
him
""
""
i'm in a midst of uh disappointment
""
we have hope for contest but election is not over and we're
fighting all of the seats
""
""
the pap supporters have been going absolutely wild for the
past few minutes the reason the newly formed kampong glam grc has gone
uncontested
""
i ask the minister for defence dr yeo ning hong if he was relieved
he didn't have to go up against any opposition this time
""
""
but a little disappointed the uh supporters are all geared up
to uh uh fight a good fight ah there won't be any contest
""
the four constituencies which make up kampong glam has uh in 1988
uh given us better than average uh votes so we are in a sense disappointed
that uh we will not be able to uh pull in the extra votes
""
""
another minister with a walk-over was environment minister dr
ahmad mattar who's now returned to brickworks grc
""
""
well i think we feel happy but at the same time we well
especially our our activists feel a little bit disappointed in the sense that
uh they were all prepared for a contest
""
""
the only single-member ward with a walk-over was kreta ayer
the seat for finance minister dr richard hu
""
among the new mps the walk-overs were kenneth chen where in 1988
lost to sdp chiam see tong in potong pasir
""
having captured more than half the eighty-one parliamentary seats
the pap still faces a fight in the remaining forty seats five grcs and twenty
single-member wards
""
five ministers will be facing opposition challenges professor
jayakumar lee yock suan mah bow tan seet ai mei and the prime minister
himself
""
""
prime minister goh chok tong arrived at eleven thirty cheered
on heartily by his supporters from marine parade grc
""
expectations that the opposition would contest marine parade grc
have been fulfilled
""
candidates for the singapore justice party filed in quietly at
eleven forty a.m.  word  supporters dominate outside in
the car-park cheering and waving banners and there don't seem to be any
supporters for the opposition
""
""
well there certainly an air of excitement here where a keenly
contested fight for bedok grc is expected once again
""
the pap is being led by a strong team by professor jayakumar dr
arthur beng mr abdullah tarmugi and mr tan soo khoon who has been moved over
from brickworks for the last from the last fifteen years but the opposition
is undeterred by this
""
they have once again decide to fight against the pap however with
an entire new team can they do better this time
""
""
i agree that pap has put up a very strong team here and i'm
not afraid of that and i'm looking forward to the good fight
""
""
i've just uh seen the names of the candidates uh i don't see
that any of them has been active in bedok or has done anything for the
residents in bedok
""
uh we are looking forward to a fight and we are confident that with
our team of four my colleagues arthur beng uh tan soo khoon and uh dullah
tarmugi we will be able to put up a good fight and get the support from the
voters
""
""
among the mps who will be facing contest in their wards are dr
tan cheng bock in ayer rajah who's challenged by mohamed aziz bin ibrahim
from pkms
""
in bukit batok dr ong chit chung will face kuan yew keng from the
sdp
""
one closely watched constituency will be tanglin which for the
first time since 1963 will be contested
""
pap's liew sim pao will face jimmy tan of the sdp and m g guru an
independent
""
""
well i'm excited about it and i think my voters are equally
excited because on my walkabouts many of them expressed to me the uh their
wish to cast their vote
""
they've not excise their right for a long time and i am glad that
this opportunity has risen for them to cast their vote and i hope they will
support the pap government
""
""
one of the most keenly contested areas is expected to be
potong pasir where sdp leader mr chiam see tong has been mp since 1984
""
the mood here is electric sdp's supporters are here and so are the
pap who are out in full force to support new candidate mr andy gan
""
but the question is will mr gan be able to reclaim potong pasir for
the pap
""
""
chances are good even though mr chiam has been working there
for a long time because uh all pap candidates stand a good chance and
furthermore i've worked in the constituency for eight years also and uh
people know me and i think they will give me their support
""
""
these two who have probably got great positions uh for them in
the government have been moved away from potong pasir and now they are
putting a a candidate which they have not announced in uh to have any
positions so you can decide for yourself what what do you think is my
competitor
""
""
this year the opposition is scaling back the size of its
challenge to the pap
""
part of the reason is that one party the sdp has decided to use the
strategy of treating this year's polls as a by-election
""
they're hoping that by fielding fewer candidates the pap would be
able to form the government on nomination day
""
this will make it easier for the opposition to win more seats on
august the thirty-first
""
however bg yeo has this to say
""
""
i don't quite understand the by-election strategy you know i
think they are making a virtue of necessity because they have great
difficulty getting candidates
""
i mean to have good candidates you must have people who feel that
there are strong rallying causes which make it worth their while to jump into
the fray
""
they've not been able to get very many good people so they decided
to concentrate their effort and therefore to say that it's a by-election
strategy in other words it is making a virtue out of necessity
""
""
this year there seems to be a greater measure of co-operation
among the opposition parties
""
their strategy is to pool their candidates together to form grc
teams strong enough to challenge the pap
""
in eunos grc the pap faces an opposition team which includes the
former member of the sdp mr mohamed jufrie mahmood
""
he joins npmp lee chiew choh wee han kim and maurice yeo from
workers' party
""
it is at this constituency where the pap won its closest fight in
1988
""
this time round they're again fielding senior minister of state for
education dr tay eng soon and he's also joined by his colleagues sidek saniff
and chew heng cheng and charles chong
""
""
one must not be too too self-confident in this matter you know
uh i think we still have to work hard to win the elections but uh we've been
uh talking to various groups of people and uh trying to see whether there are
any major issues that and unhappiness they have uh
""
so far they have brought out very few
""
""
what do you think of chance your chances of becoming a full mp
this time around
""
""
well we've always been optimistic
""
""
what makes you think that this strategy of moving into
workers' party will work i mean uh instead
""
""
well i cannot tell you for sure that it'll work but i think it
gives us the best chance and i being in touch and having close close rapport
with the leadership of the sdp and the wp i think i should be able to bring
these two parties together
""
""
the opposition has concentrated its efforts on the
single-member wards for example  word  of the jurong
junior college nomination centre are being contested
""
""
these pap supporters have come out in full force to cheer
their side on and it's this kind of support that the pap will have to count
on  word 
""
for the second time running sdp chairman mr ling how doong will be
up against dr seet ai mee
""
dr seet won by a narrow margin in the 1988 election
""
""
when i met mr ling in 1988 i was not completely not known to
singapore and uh very and had very little exposure even in the consitu the
new constituency of bukit gombak
""
in the last three years i have worked hard to be a good mp to my
residents and have tried to develop facilities which the residents needed and
have gained great rapport with them so it is uh it will still be a hard fight
uh but it will be a test of the residents' appreciation uh and whether and
that their support for me to carry on the kind of work i've done with them in
the last three years
""
""
i expect those who supported me at the last general election
in 1988 would support me this time round and then i would expect those who
supported dr seet they would turn round and support me because of all those
very harsh policies of the government 
""
another closely watched constituency will be ulu pandan where the
pap has fielded mr lim boon heng to take over from dr dixie tan mr lim faces
sdp's ashleigh seow who in the last election contested aljunied grc of course
i would uh have to work hard to uh meet them and uh explain to them uh what i
have done in ang mo kio and how i can uh translate the ideas which we've
implemented in ang mo kio into ulu pandan what do you think your chances are
well it's always an upward battle against the pap they are entrenched they
have all the assets at their disposal all the means financial and otherwise
so it's always an upward battle for the opposition today the pap introduced
two candidates khoo sai kee and harun abdul gani those have walk-overs within
the first two hours of being introduced for the pap the total number of
first-timers is eleven the party usually fields between sixteen and eighteen
new faces but as the prime minister has said because of the early electionit
couldn't meet its usual quota this year's new pap candidates eight have
already walked in without a fight one of them khoo sai kee who's in the
tanjong pagar grc team together with another new face lim hng kiang commented
on their walk-over we are we are we are mps and uh we are a little bit
disappointed because uh we have no opportunity to uh to work the ground so
this means that hng kiang and i are virgin mps uh so which means we've to
work even harded to get to know the people new pap candidate for the
walk-over is ho peng kee sembawang grc i'm a bit disappointed at not having
had the opportunity to go through an election i think that's uh for me as a
first candidate a new candidate something that i would learn a lot as for the
rest of the new pap candidates it will be the first time they're campaigning
for a seat in parliament on the opposition side there are about twelve
candidates fielded for the first time among them are ong teng kui and sari
hasa from now till august the thirty-first eighty-five candidates from the
six parties will go on the campaign trail and they'll be appealing to some
eight hundred and fifty thousand voters who'll make their choice known on
polling day
