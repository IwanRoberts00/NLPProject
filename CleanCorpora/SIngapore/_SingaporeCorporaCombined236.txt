now what you see here is the workplace shelf okay uhm these are icons okay what you see here are icon you can move them around using your mouse buttons okay you can uhm drag them and reposition them and things like the a shape like this meant uh folders this is quite the same as windows three dot x kind of uhm uh interface where you click and it open uh it's a folder or mackintosh okay now i show you what are the differences okay let me find a scratch disk okay now for example i want to access uh my drive a the diskette that i've just stuck in okay what normally i can do is i go to the command prompt and say a and let maybe fall back but in in this kind of an object oriented workplace shelf what i can do is i open the drive folder and you can see that these are all the drive i have i have a drive b drive is my uh tape word i have in my hard disk c d e f partition and i have a c r rom attached on this this system so for exmaple like i want to okay this shows what i have in the a drive disk it's blank now for example like i want to format the disk i can just click on the icon and i got the pop up menu okay i can just press and clicks and say format okay and it give me what are the various uh capacity i i'll like to format okay then i just click format it'll go formatting now let's look at the other uhm stuff we have on the desk top okay we have things like a shredder here okay which you can creates uh objects i mean you you can delete an object for example uhm i want trash away this file called tic-tak-toe i can just drag and drop on the shredder and guess what delete right this is quite similar to mackintosh anyone is a mackintosh user over there ya it looks like mackintosh right you drag it to the i think mackintosh is trash trash can okay so this is delete and let let's look at the dos uhm folder here which i have all this dull dos icon here what do i do if let's say if i want to change an icon okay it's also object oriented right i just have to click the setting notebook for this icon and if this is lotus and i want to use this icon for it i can just drag this and i drop on the current icon box here and guess what this icon is changed okay so it's this kind of thing you don't have to issue command say change icon or you don't have to go to the top bar there and pull down your selection ah select icon change this kind of thing so it's object oriented in this aspects and for example like uhm changing the colour of your uh system object for example like i want to go to the background okay uh i go to the system setup what i need to do is i just open the colour palate the colours are  word also object what i have to do is just drag the colour and drop onto the place where i want to change you can see that the colours change pretty nicely okay and to activate programme is just by double clicking of the of the icon and you'll see that while i was doing all those the formatting is done in the background this is what i meant by multitasking and it's done and for example i want to save a file onto drive b what do i do i can just drag and drop on it for example this file type a i'll drag and can see that i think the a drive should be blinking right it's not sorry or i'll choose another file anyway uhm how about word  ya if if in case for any reason why i can't move this file you'll see that the no entry sign is there okay not to worry let me copy something from my e drive uhm let me  word save file does not use the text file that means i can copy can drag over drag you know hopefully i think it's there it's there right i think so so to show that it's there okay the convix save file is there so but anyway if for any doser  word common command prompt user would like to use command prompt die-hard those of you without without seeing the command prompt  word there's also o s two command prompt you can use okay and from this command prompt you can always uh set for this is the o s two command prompt and you can open up a dos file by just saying well then you can go to a dos environment okay i'll show more of this later okay uhm like for example like the drive folders i open up you can also see that it's in a tree form and this the sub-directories are all organise in folders also okay so it is object oriented in this ex aspect now what i want to show you next is uhm compatiblity of uhm dos and window i'l i'll have you got a very clear i mean at least a clear idea of what workplace shelf it's this shell this moving of icon this creating of icon deleting by dragging pulling word dropping this is what i meant easy to use or the or the workplace shell okay the next topic that i want to go through is the compatibility of uhm dos okay for i can run things like word perfect for dos okay and i can put them into the background alright this is dos word perfect running in one window and i can run lotus one two three and i can put this also in the window form put them side by side okay now by a by being able to run my dos applications side by side onto on on the desk on the o s two desk top what does it buy me as a user okay in the dos environment or in the simple dos dos environment single tasking even uhm what you can do let's say you want to copy all this sales uhm figures all this figures onto a word processor file what you can do is you can only convert them to a file and then export them in word perfect you have to read those text file in right but let's say if you run can run them on the desk top side by side you can do simple things like cut and paste right and it hand word  enhance the capability of your dos applications it's not only the dos application you can do cut and paste uhm in our office i'm using the comms manager two okay uhm i'm able to you see now in the in the host environment let's say if i want to reply to a mail somebody send me a mail okay it's in fax form i want to reply to the mail and i i like to do some quoting so normaly if if i don't don't have o s two cut and paste facility what i have to do is i have to copy that mail into a file then i open up the file i use the text editor to add those arrow by the side then i close that file i have to evoke that mail and call that file in and then i send that file okay now in in the host i mean if running on o s two what i can do is i just lift word up that portion of text mark it up in my incoming mail okay it'll click and go into my o s two clip board then i just have to key into i mean uh respond then you have have another fresh uhm mailer screen to come up then i say paste paste onto the same box okay in that in that case i can do a lot of manipulation and that would add to my capability of my using my prompt my i b m prompt i don't know whether this will give you a good idea or not because i think in n u s you just use prompt right bitnet yah for today's set up here you can see the two machine actually we're trying to do some networking in this room but it was not really successful so we can't do that uh therefore i just mention this okay okay cut and paste uh well this is just between the dos applications now what i'm going to show is uhm sharing of datas uhm between o s two and windows applications with this i would like to show that o s two can run windows and of course it can also share the windows application data with whatever application that it is running on windows platform okay so i'll like to run excel here this is microsoft excel now in o s two point o when i run excel i probably would have to run it in the full screen mode that means uhm i have to go into the uh windows win dot com and you'll see whole whole page of window but this application now is running what i call seamlessly on the o s two desk top okay this within this box that you see here is all the windows kind of uh interface the minimise icon into this manner okay now let's look at an o s two spreadsheet which is the lotus one two three by the way the lotus one two three release two that this one i'm running is the thirty-two bit application and i'll touch on the benefits of using thrity-two bit applications where recently there was an article in the business times i wonder if anyone read uh in thirty-two bit we trust or something like that written by lim sin sin now this this two spreadsheet is running side by side let me enter some figure onto this uh excel side just some simple number let me block it up and say copy then i edit and i paste link over this side what i'm trying to do here is uh is d d e link okay uhm does anybody know what's d ding d d e link in the windows environment there is this called this link called dynamic data exchange link okay you're able to share data dynamically uhm between two applications and if you change one the other one should change okay normally what you see happens is between two windows applications now i'm showing you is one on windows the other one is on o s two applications and d d e does work okay now i want to change uhm for example this okay and you see that side is eight perhaps the numbers you can't see properly maybe i put it into a chart okay this is uh o s two lotus one two three's chart then i choose this one uh do i have a three d one here is a three-d one and can see much better okay so you can see that the d d e link data is almost instanteous update okay i'll just like to explain a bit how this is being done so that you can appreciate that this is not actually as simple as what you see although you can see that the update is quite fast first when you do the d d e okay the data has to go into a clipboard and that went into the win o s two clipboard first okay that's the windows clipboard maintained by o s two  now from there when i do a paste paste link over to a a o s twos application there's another clipboard is being call up and it's active in the background and we can't see that is the o s two clipboard and information is passed from uhm the excel into the clipboard in o s via word  o s two and passed transferably to o s two's clipboard and goes out to lotus one two three's clipboard and all this passing around is transparent to the user and let alone when you save there's a change in value all these changes will be go through with this manner okay
