 16 march 1992 live from parliament  mr chairman sir in singapore we do not really know the extent of the population that have disabilities using an estimate of three point eight percent used by asian countries such as hong kong and japan there are about ninety seven thousand disabled people in singapore the services for disabled people provided by the voluntary welfare organizations cater only for about eight thousand disabled people the question is are we doing enough there are four areas which i would like to touch on firstly a national registry of disabled persons despite the shortcomings of the previous central registry of disabled persons i believe that the ministry should set up a national registry of disabled persons for this registry to succeed the referral process must be made simple and the referral sources identified sources of referrals should include hospitals school health services maternal and child health clinics polyclinics and schools without a proper database it will be difficult to project manpower needs and plan for infra-structural needs by making the referral process easy and by increasing public awareness of the registry the government will be able to get a better approximation of the incidence of disabled persons and the different disabilities involved this will be extremely useful for future planning secondly educational and training programs currently there are insufficient special schools the vocational training in sheltered workshop programs are limited and there's a shortage of trained staff what plans do the ministry have in overcoming these shortcomings thirdly national coordinating centre for the disabled the ministry should work with the singapore council of social services in setting up a coordinating centre for the disabled which will employ full-time staff the centre will maintain the registry coordinate the activities of all government and voluntary associations providing for the disabled and plan for future infra-structural needs lastly activities of daily living to facilitate the disabled in their integration i'm heartened that in many places the buildings have been designed to cater for the needs of those who are disabled we can do more for example mcd should coordinate with the hdb to help disabled persons who apply for hdb flats to obtain flats that are at that to obtain flats that are at the ground floor or at the same level as the lift we must do more for fellow singaporeans who are disabled what plans do the ministry have in facilitating the disabled in their activities of daily living sir i would like to know the minister's views in these areas mr yeo thank you mr speaker sir sir both mr abdullah tarmugi and uh dr michael lim have raised questions on the disabled sir the government's policy towards the uh disabled is to help them to live independently so as in order sorry is to enable them to live independently as far as it's compatible with their capabilities this would enable them to look after themselves as to lessen the burden on the family sir the uh house should recall that in nineteen eighty eight an advisory council on the disabled was formed to recommend uh ways to help the disabled and to help them to integrate into society the council's recommendations covered a wide spectrum of issues affecting the disabled such as prevention of disability special education accessibility and transportation social services and institutional care sir twenty six of the recommendations were adopted by the government for for implementation and these are now in the various stages of implementation and would be of great help to disabled to the uh disabled sir historically the voluntary sector has been in the forefront of provision of services for the disabled they have done extremely well and should be con should be encouraged to continue to do so we will assist them as far as possible to provide improved and expanded ah programs now through the concerted efforts of both government and the vwos a wide range of services and facilities have already been implemented this include special education vocational training and rehabilitation vocational assessment and job placement production at sheltered workshops day-care hostels and residential care mr tarmugi has asked in terms of what are we providing to the uh to the disabled sir we've set aside about twenty two million dollars as capital grants for the further development and upgrading of facilities for the disabled for the period nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety four twenty two million dollars over the over the five years and we will also support these vwos in their recurrent expenditures as such funding would amount to forty seven million dollars over the next three years sir we would be helping the vwos to establish two more residential homes for the disabled one production workshop one sheltered workshop two day-activities centres one hostel and two multi-service centres some of these are already in the process of development sir in terms of the uh special education for example they are already currently thirteen special education schools with enrolment of about two thousand five hundred children and uh the government provides a grant of four thousand six hundred dollars per student which is twice the cost of the regular primary school education program sir dr michael lim has asked some other specific uh questions also he has asked that the sources that are in terms of having a referral service for the disabled and that we need to set up a uh centralized referral system and registry and that such the cen such a centre can then be a co-ordinating centre for the disabled sir at the present moment there's a very loose arrangement for referring disabled people for help for example there are referrals uh systems whereby disabled are then referred either to the vwos that are involved in helping the disabled or they're referred to the various centres for the aged sick like for example the uh home nursing foundation has a senior citizens day-care centres that also help the disabled recover from strokes for example uh we also have community day uh based day-care centres which help which uh provide help to such disabled sir the council of social services will be undergoing some changes in the future and they would specific committees to focus attention on different groups of people that require help so they will have a committee which will focus strictly on the disabled and this group will then be able to study into what are the best ways to reach out to the uh to the disabled and what sort of help to provide to such people so i think with the setting of this unit in the uh council uh in the near future would be able to have a more effective method for compiling such data sir the in terms of training programs there are training programs available for the disabled already for example uh vitb already conducts training programs and uh hundred and three disabled people have been able to take part in the uh regular vitb programs for those unable to take part in the vitb programs the uh vwos do have training programs of their own for example the vocational school for the handicapped uh offers training programs and uh there're also uh sheltered workshops offering skills training as well as pre-employment training the singapore council of so social service has also set up a centre called the bees link centre which has a centralized vocational assessment service as well as a job placement centre the uh the bees link centre also operates a production workshop employing disabled people who have potential but who face some difficulties in getting jobs for the time being so there are enough training uh places available in terms of uh of the number of workshops there'll be more that'll be set up sir he's also talked about barriers to the disabled physical as well as emotional barriers sir the government together with the vwos have been conducting educational programs and public awareness programs to raise the awareness of both the public and more importantly employers in terms of providing in terms of being more sympathetic to the uh to the disabled and to offer them employment the point specifically brought up by mr tarmugi that what the disabled are looking for are opportunities not just sympathy so a there're various programs that are available to help the employment in employment of disabled people the bees link centre as i mentioned has the uh job placement centre the centre has already placed out two hundred and twenty seven uh disabled people in uh various companies there're also other schemes for example uh the there's a scheme whereby employers who are taking in disabled people are helped through a subsidy that's provided by uh that's provided by the singapore chinese chamber of commerce and industry under this scheme employers who employ disabled ah can have the first one and a half months salary of the disabled paid through a fund which is provided by the chamber uh so this this way it allows the employers who are who have never had the experience of employing disabled to take in disabled for a trial period and they're assured that for the first one and a half months the salaries are borne by this fund we also provide tax incentives to employers who make work site modifications in order to accommodate the uh disabled so in terms of direct help to employers in terms of providing training for the disabled and in terms of providing a placement service all these are already there and uh i'm sure the vwos will be looking into more ways of enhancing such programs in the future in terms of physical barriers sir the government does advocate a barrier-free environment uh within the community for the uh disabled and the aged this led to the government incorporating the accessibility code into the building control regulations in february nineteen ninety in order to promote a barrier-free environment the government also formed a coordin coordinating committee to provide a comprehensive barrier-free environment under the ministry of national development i think members would have noticed some of the uh decisions and programs which have been implemented as a result of this uh policy you've seen the public walkways in the city for example are being modified so that ramps are provided allowing our handicapped to get on to the walkways without having to uh move up the uh the step uh now he has also mentioned about hdb flats sir hdb has also been very supportive the hdb has already formulated guidelines on uh incorporating barrier-free features in its in its estates the new hdb blocks in the future will have uh provision wherever possible for improved linkages with adjoining blocks there're also there'll be also more blocks where you have lift opening on every floor uh the lift lobbies would have ramps to facilitate movement of wheelchairs and the lift size would be wide enough for the wheelchair so this this would help disabled who are are moving around in wheelchairs sir hdb has also uh made provisions which meets what the member has asked for that is an applicant or a family member who is medically or physically handicapped will be able to uh be considered for priority allocation of a floor uh for a flat on a lower floor as well as a flat on the lift landing floor so this has already been uh incorp been uh implemented already sir so i think in due course the disabled will find that moving around would be a lot easier than compared to let's say five years ago when uh more ramps are available and more uh of the barriers are are removed i think i've i've replied to most of his points under the under the disabled sir i move on to the aged population both mr tarmugi and dr michael lim have also have spoken on the aged  sir the aged is an issue which should concern all of us that is because our aged population will increase very significantly today only nine percent of our population are aged above sixty by the by the year twenty thirty about one in four of our population would be above the age of sixty and one there'll be one aged to two persons in the working age group of fifteen to sixteen so i think this is a problem which is of uh which will have great significance uh and great and and uh many implications for society in singapore now what is heartening and important to note is that fortunately most elderly are actually healthy our studies show that about ninety three percent of elderly are fit active and healthy only five percent are frail and about two percent are bed-ridden sir because of the large number of elderly that we'll be having in the uh future the responsibility for caring for the aged falls on all of us everyone the family the community the government and the aged themselves sir in lloking after the aged we must preserve the family as the best social insurance for its members because by the year twenty twenty thirty even if we want to we won't be able to find enough economically active people to lookj after the aged because the numbers the number of the uh aged will be so great sir the family setting allows the aged to grow old graciously in familiar surroundings and therefore help them to maintain their self-worth and dignity the our programs are therefore directed towards helping them to live within the community sir mr tarmugi has asked in terms of caring for the aged sick and poor what is the amount of health uh what are we doing in terms of providing health facilities and uh in terms of helping us to meet the needs of the elderly what sort of institutional what sort what are we doing in terms of providing inti in uh insitutional care and in terms of helping them to live within the com the community sir our programs which are aimed at helping the aged to live within the the uh families and the community are aimed at promoting self-help or mutual help because for every frail elderly there'll be at least twenty fit and healthy elderly so whilst we have very few working people to help look after the elderly in the future we must not forget we'll have a large number of very fit and healthy uh older person who should then participate in helping to look after themselves sir the success of our programs to help the aged depends on uh how the public perceives and perceives the aged in the process of aging and how they accept the aged i think there's a tendency to perceive the aged as being sickly dependent and decrepit we must change such an sttitude if we are going to be able to encourage more members of the public to come forward to participate in uh providing assistance to the uh to the elderly so what the gov the government is doing is that we are having a annual public awareness and public educaiton program on the aged in order to enhance the level of awareness of the population now the highlight of this program is is our senior citizens' day and uh i'm glad to say that the program has been quite successful because the level of participation in our senior citizens' day's program at both the national and the constituency level are have been increasing sir in terms of for the aged relief alone my family run uh my ministry runs a befriender service scheme which helps to recruit volunteers and matches them to the senior citizens the volunteers befriend advise and assist the aged to cope with their daily demands of living within the community because it is important for us to encourage and to assist the elderly to live within the community and to only be uh obtaining institutional care as a matter of last reort in line with that we also have the uh home nursing foundation assisted by the ministry of health which provides a home nursing service and trains members in the care of their aged dependents we also provide uh screening and medical counselling in such centres sir the singapore action group of elders uh also has established a hot-line and counselling service for the aged and uh they are able to provide advice counselling and referral uh services for the elderly who are who are who require such services mr speaker: mr yeo we are running out of time on this amendment mr yeo cheow tong: okay yes sir mr speaker: you you mr yeo cheow tong: sir so in terms of helping them to live within the community we have a lot of programs in terms of institutional care we will also be there're there're already adequate nursing homes and uh other facilities uh we will be helping the vwos increase the number of uh places in the homes to meet the requirements for the for the coming yeasr by funding eighty percent of the cost of these new facilities in terms of uh recurring expenses we will also be helping them sir we we will therefore be making sure that we have enough institutional uh facilities uh to to help look after those who require institutional care sir let me move on to uh the issue of public assistance sir the public assistance scheme is meant to help the financially distressed to regain their independence it's not meant as an unemployment retirement or disability allowance sir we grant uh allowances to the aged destitues the disabled and the chronically sick the orphans and the widows sir the the scheme has to be stringent i know members are not very comfortable with or some members are not comfortable with that but our scheme has to be stringent in order to encourage the able body to re to uh rely on themselves and not to rely on the dole sir if we don't that don't do that then i think we 're heading down the slippery road to uh disaster on no one in singapore is denied the opportunity to apply for pa sir but whilst we open the door for all to apply i think we must be careful to ensure that whilst we have a soft heart we don't have a soft head because as dr lim has mentioned some members in his constituencies feel shy about applying they feel that it's a shameful thing to do sir i think it's not at all a bad emotion because if they are if they feel that it is degrading to apply and therefore they re they are able to rely on their own other mechanisms as well as to rely on other organizations to help them i think it's a it's a very good thing we should dr michael lim: speaker sir can i just clarify well uh my point is that uh they've actually applied and uh they have uh actually been interviewed and have been accepted for the scheme but uh because of the following the interview they felt that it was as if they were begging and therefore they declined their assistance and came to us for assistance but our assistance is limited mr yeo: but they've gone ahead to apply and they have been interviewed then why have they withdrawn the application sir the the key thing is now the key thing is we want to be sure that only those who are genuinely in need and who are unable to find other forms of assistance apply for pa assistance that must be the basis and for those who have applied they we must subject them to some interviewing to ensure these are the genuine cases i think there's no other way sir for us to sort out the genuine from the non-genuine but i can assure uh members that the interviews are done very professionally they're non-threatening they're in no way meant to embarrass the applicants and also the data and information gathered are treated very confidentially sir when i'm when i uh went into mcd i made sure that all rejections were seen by me to ensure that the rejections were valid i'm glad to say that in all rejections in in all rejection cases while i was in mcd and before that the uh rejections were valid because the applicants really upon investigation were found that they have either adequate savings of their own or they were actually being supported by their families by their children relatives so all the cases were rejected on good grounds sir mr speaker: mr yeo mr yeo: sir but nonetheless mr speaker: would you like to wind up your answer mr yeo: okay sir what uh what we want to stress is that the pa scheme is adequate we do review the rates we do ensure that the the uh pa allowances are adequate to ensure that the pa recipients are able to survive and more moreover more importantly we also on top of the pa scheme are able to draw on other resources to help the uh recipients dr michael lim: uh speaker sir can i just add one last statement uh it appears it appears that my twenty nine year old uh housewife with three children will not find solace in your answer uh perhaps uh minister before he just ends would like to make a comment about the proposal i made with regards to the widowed woman with the children mr yeo: sir i'm not familiar with his twenty nine year old uh widow the case of the twenty nine year old widow if he feels that the the uh widow has got good grounds he shoudl as mp write in to reappeal and i'm sure my my my ah offi officials would uh reconsider in terms of his uh his suggestion that we we channel the pa grants through the cccs sir i'm that in the first place that his ccc uh was able to provide some help i think that's a right way to go the the payment of the pa allowance through the posb is a very convenient one it imposes no inconvenience on the recipients mr speaker: mr yeo i think you've answered mr dr lim already mr tarmugi is member given leave to withdraw his amendment amendment withdrawn
