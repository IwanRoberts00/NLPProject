 property agent and client thurs 18/3/99  good morning mr bek i'm glad that you are able to make it have a seat mr bek you said that you were recommended by teo yes my friend teo was impressed by your ability to market his house at such a good price as well and also so quickly too when he knew that i wish to sell my house he quickly called me to contact you that's nice of him thank you i would be most glad to help you market your house so i believe that you are looking for a house oh yes i need you to get one for me okay let me tell you more of my house the house i am staying now is a 5 i unit in tampines it's just passed five years i bought it for one hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars i wish to downgrade to a 4a or 4i unit in tampines can you please give me some advice so as to what i should do etc sure basically the guidelines towards purchasing a resale flat in the open market is quite simple since you have a house it is easier at least on your finance before you get a loan from hdb they would want to use up all your cpf funds in the ordinary account before they lend to you so we have to check whether you have the sufficient twenty percent deposit required when you purchased the house as well as your income to determine the amount of loan available allowable for you oh is your wife going to be the co-owner that is she is sharing in the payment of the house yes my wife will be my co-owner and will be sharing in paying for the house we have a combined cpf of about eighty thousand dollars in our ordinary account okay a 4a or 4i would fetch about two hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred and eighty thousand depending on the location the level whether it is at lift landing or not is it facing western/eastern sun etc quite a number of factors will be involved in the pricing of the flat not forgetting the renovation done to the house so your eighty thousand dollars would easily cover the deposit of between fifty thousand to sixty thousand and also the stamp fees etc how much are both of you earning now as for myself my gross salary is two thousand five hundred a month and my wife's is about one thousand eight hundred a month and how much did you have to pay for your present five-room and how much have both of you paid so far our present house cost us one hundred and seven-three thousand and we have paid so far about eight-six thousand dollars how much can my house fetch now is it somewhere three hundred and fifty thousand yeah the market is about this amount we have to call for valuation first after which we can decide to advertise the amount we wish to sell but before that we should look out for your new house first in this way you can be assured of sufficient time to renovate your new place to move in just in time for you to hand the keys of your five-room flat to the new owner all the process will take four months approximately but i will need a total of six months to look for a house for you as well as marketing your five-room as for commission we charge a one per cent commission for helping you to buy a flat and two per cent for selling your flat if you agree on the terms spelt out can you please sign us an exclusive for marketing your house what do you think mr bek i think that is fine with me what do you need my ic yes thank you  okay ming chuan lim ming chuan still under medical leave  word last time
