 13 mar ' 92 friday live from parliament 
""
""
sir i beg that the sum to be allocated for head n be reduced by
ten dollars in respect of code n
""
one thousand five hundred of the main estimates
""
mr chairman sir i would like to speak on a subject that has been
raised many times both by my parliamentary colleagues and myself
""
i will not bore the house with all the details or the arguments
which have been sufficiently dealt with on previous occasions
""
the issue is an extension of medical benefits to the family of
female civil servants
""
surely the minister will agree with me that our female civil
servants work as hard as and as competently as their male counterparts
""
i'm sure the minister would also agree with me that that at the
principal the civil servant or any employer for that matter should employ and
reward staff based on their ability and performance and not by their sex
""
the last time this issue was raised the finance minister did give
the indication that he may look into this matter at an appropriate time
""
i do urge the minister to give some serious thought and
consideration to the request
""
this time i hope the minister will not give me a 'no' for an answer
and i look forward to a favourable reply
""
""
question is that the sum to be allocated for head n to be
reduced by ten dollars in respect of code n i fifteen hundred of the main
estimates dr hu
""
""
i understand the concern for the member of yuhua uh i can only
say 'maybe' in the sense that we are reviewing the whole remuneration package
of the civil service and this is one aspect which we will consider
""
""
ya chairman sir
""
i think the answer is better than 'no' so i beg to withdraw my
amendment
""
""
member given leave to withdraw amendment
""
amendment is withdrawn
""
number three mr heng chiang meng
""
""
sir i beg to move that the sum to be allocated for head n be
reduced by ten dollars in respect of code n fifteen hundred of the main
estimates
""
mr chairman under our current system of corporate tax losses of
companies are allowed to be carried forward to offset subsequent years
profits
""
sir but if there is a change in substantial ownership or rather
substantial change in ownership these tax losses are not allowed to be
carried forward
""
sir in nineteen eighty eight the rule was modified to allow certain
situations of substantial change of ownership in which companies could
continue to make use of these tax losses
""
these situations were mainly those of  word 
such as changes as a result of nationalisation or privatisation or the
companies' shares being widely traded on a recognised stock exchange
""
and provided that such changes are not made for the purpose of tax
benefit or advantage
""
sir although this concession in nineteen eighty eight was better
than nothing uh it still fall short of what is required in the market
""
sir i do agree with the the finance minister that there is merit in
not allowing loss-making companies to be tax sheltered
""
but i do feel that there are some group of companies that require
some form of relief from this rule in particularly i mean uh young start out
companies
""
sir these are companies started by enterprising daring
entrepreneurs with good ideas and with the money maybe for their own from
their own savings as well as support from their friends but with lots of guts
and belief in themselves and their ideas
""
sir for such companies it is quite usual for them to suffer losses
in the earlier years especially when they are small difficult to get finance
and trying to develop their ideas into marketable products and services
""
often after a while new capital is necessary
""
sir at this stage the poor entrepreneur will normally try to
interest a large company to buy a part of the company
""
sir large companies normally were once controlling interest and
provided the price is correct
""
tax losses then can become an issue for if the losses can be
carried forward it may be worthwhile for the company to take over the
majority of the ailing company
""
so because of this issue sometimes the deal falls through
""
but even if the deal gets uh carried through often the entrepreneur
has to sell off at a very paltry price
""
my question is this: should we not help such enterprise in
singaporeans considering that we are trying to promote entrepreneurship
""
shouldn't he be allowed to recoup some of his losses via a better
price if the tax losses can be carried forward even if there is a change in
ownership
""
sir in such cases if we do allow the tax losses to be carried
forward
""
i think uh we will definitely encourage more entrepreneurship and
perhaps more struggling companies with good futures may be saved and who
knows sir some of these companies may become your future sias and the keppel
corporations
""
so sir i would like to cons ask the minister to consider my
proposal of waiving the substantial ownership rule for such companies and in
case he is fearful of abuse i can think straightaway of a number of controls
for him
""
sir like for example tax losses can only be offset offsetted
against profits in the same trade
""
another one could be like the qualifying company should be smaller
companies like i've described above so for companies of say uh ten million
dollars of shareholders' funds or below and three could be say the limit the
tax losses incurred for the say past few years prior to the substantial
change in ownership so say for three years
""
sir i'm very sure that there are many others but the purpose of my
bringing up these few controls is to show that there are ways of controlling
tax loss companies from becoming general tax shelters because i think that is
the main fear of the minister sir may i continue my second cut
""
""
yes yes
""
""
sir on the second cut first i would like to say that in my
constituency besides hdb estates there are also quite a number of private
residential estates some new but many old
""
sir with the assistance given by the government for hdb upgrading
and the sales of hdb shops to sitting tenants
""
some of my private residential well private estates uh residents
have asked me whether the government would also help them to renovate in
other words to upgrade their capital assets in other words their residential
properties especially with respect to the older properties built in the
fifties and sixties
""
sir any assistance in this area means either higher expenditure by
the government or lesser revenue to the government
""
and i think the finance minister holds the purse strings and so i
think he is the best person to answer such queries whether or not the
government would help
""
sir the question is this:
""
should he entertain request for financial assistance from sources
other than hdb residents
""
the hdb residents are today highly subsidised by the government in
terms of the sales price for their flats in terms of maintenance and running
of their estate and in terms of for example the upgrading that the government
the is going to go ahead and even the sale of shops to the sitting tenants
""
sir as one of the private estate resident remark:
""
if the government wishes to distribute some fat surely we should
teeny weeny bit
""
moreover i would like to add that not all private property dwellers
are rich
""
not all private properties are sparkling new bungalows or full
facility condominiums
""
there are many old developments some even along the major roads
""
perhaps the minister can consider their request for some assistance
""
in fact if i remember sir in nineteen seventy or from nineteen
seventy to nineteen seventy eight there was a garden tax for the maintenance
of uh garden tax remission for the maintenance of gardens in line with the
garden city concept
""
so here if these old developments are an eyesore it might be worth
helping in a similar way
""
sir to prevent abuse it could always be limited to those properties
above a certain age and below a certain market value
""
sir i i shall leave the actual numbers to the minister since he has
the necessary information to have the correct cut off provided of course he
agrees with the idea
""
sir i beg to move
""
""
question is that the sum to be allocated for head n be reduced
by ten dollars in respect of code n fifteen hundred of the main estimates dr
hu
""
""
mr chairman sir
""
on the question of uh carry forward of losses up to now we have
been satisfied that the arrangements introduced so far were satisfactorily
""
uh the reason for this is up to now we have received thirty four
applications for such approvals
""
half were approved but the rest the ones which were not approved
were rejected because there was suggestions or indications that my companies
were bought over for tax reasons however uhm mr heng has brought up a
different category of companies
""
he's talking about new small companies who face peculiar problems
problems peculiar to themselves where a general application of rules applying
to all companies big and large might work to their disadvantage
""
i'm prepared to consider looking at this as a special case and uh i
will ask officer to examine and perhaps we'll approach mr heng for more
details of the suggestions he has indicated and we will certainly consider it
""
the idea is not to penalise companies but to ensure that in the
process of granting these concessions that uh the government not taken
advantage of
""
but if there are ways in which we can ease the problems of
companies by administrative changes i'm quite prepared to do so
""
the second point he's raised is tax relief or upgrading of private
residential properties
""
this is a problem which always arises when we give some something
government gives some to some sectors of the population the request will be
made:
""
why not extend it to someone else
""
and i think it's a fair question but i'll like to point out that
the hdb upgrading scheme essentially directed at persons who have who are
living in hdb flats who therefore need the subsidies which government grants
via the hdb flat scheme
""
without the upgrading process it's it it's likely that many hdb
house owners will not have the resources to upgrade some of the older flats
both internally and externally and some of them are quite old and we have
areas of significant urban decay which is undesirable and the government's
program is to correct several things at the same time
""
one is to upgrade the quality of the urban housing in hdb estates
and secondly to provide help to hdb residents to increase their asset values
""
whether such programs can be applied to private residential housing
is something which i think we need to consider very carefully because the
general assumption is that people who live in bungalows or private housing
are usually better off financially and therefore ownership of landed
properties cannot justify government's help or subsidies in any form other
than the beautification greening attempt we we made some years ago
""
however if mr heng can let me know the type of houses he has in
mind in his constituency which are in such a bad state of repair where the
residents are so poor that some form of is necessary well i'm sure we would
be happy to consider
""
""
mr heng
""
""
sir in view of the rather positive answers given by the
minister i'm very glad to withdraw my cut
""
""
member given leave to withdraw his amendment
""
yes withdrawn
