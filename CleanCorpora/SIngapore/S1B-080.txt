""

""
""
yes i know
""
""
but let me introduce myself first
""
my name is tow yi
""
""
hello i am christine
""
""
christine all right okay
""
so what why are you interested in star wars
""
""
star wars probably i am because probably because of the uhm
movies
""
""
uhm
""
""
i am quite fascinated by the you know the costumes and stuff
like that
""
""
ah ya
""
i agree with you too
""
""
and the story line
""
too bad it is quite ya very exciting
""
""
the things about good versus evil light versus dark
""
""
ya ya ya ya
""
""
ya it is fantastic
""
it is just very very good
""
aren't you excited about the new movie coming out
""
""
ya ya ya
""
""
ya i heard that the date that it will be shown in singapore is
june the third
""
""
ya i heard about it before
""
""
and the trailers are already running in some of the cinemas
""
and it is very very good
""
""
i have not seen it yet
""
""
haven't seen it yet
""
you better you must check it out
""
it is very very good
""
""
i just heard it from my friends
""
and it is good you know
""
""
ya ya you know what is the story about this this
""
a lot of people has been asking what is the story about
""
""
uh not very sure
""
""
actually you know about star wars right
""
""
ya
""
""
star wars the trilogy is actually the forth part of the story
that george lucas thought of
""
so empire strikes back is the fifth and return of the jedi is
actually the sixth
""
now he is going back to explain the story of how uhm uhm the dark
the evil forces came about rebellion came about and how how a small little
boy called anakin skywalker becomes darth vader
""
""
i see
""
should be interesting
""
""
ya very grand
""
ya very grand
""
a lot of there is a lot a lot being written about it and uhm can't
wait just can't wait
""
now let us go into the toys
""
so so it is such a big collection to start with and star wars toys
have been around for so many years vehicles figurines play sets and things
like that
""
so uhm you have decide where to start with
""
you cannot start i don't think you want to buy everything because
it would be a fortune
""
""
no i cannot afford so probably i would start uhm with the
newer ones ha
""
""
the newer ones ha
""
""
yes
""
""
but the newer ones uhm uhm actually it has been around for
some time also
""
""
yes i know
""
""
ya it also cost quite a lot and because you started so late
and a lot of the figures that you may want would be very very difficult to
find
""
""
i will just get those by which you can find first and the rest
i will think later
""
and depending on the price also
""
""
oh yes
""
""
so how much are you selling yours
""
""
uhm i always like new collectors to start their new collection
and i always wish them to carry on because it is such uh uh to me it is a
very nice hobby
""
i have been doing this for so many years
""
so i will give you a very reasonable price
""
very reasonable believe me
""
you will okay we will talk about the price later but let us not
talk about that
""
maybe we talk about the figures and things like that
""
so the thing about the figures is it is very small but somebody
like to start with the dolls the twelve inch dolls
""
i have a few here i can show you like this is princess leia all
white and things like that
""
""
no i think i prefer the smaller ones
""
""
the smaller ones ha
""
""
yes which is more expensive
""
""
ya
""
but maybe i suggest this
""
the thing to start with maybe a theme
""
""
a what
""
""
start with a theme
""
okay for some people it would be too much for them to start with
""
they like to start with a certain scenario like uhm uhm certain
guys i know they like the bounty hunters a lot
""
they appear in you know in the empire strikes back
""
""
if i am not wrong i think is boba fett
""
""
boba fett and uh a lot of other characters also bousk and
things like that
""
so what i suggest one way you can do is go about doing this is uhm
you can actually get the bounty hunters first
""
set that scene you know set your scene because that is your
favourite scene
""
""
ya ya
""
in fact i like them
""
""
ya what else
""
i know some of the girls believe me girls also come to my shop to
buy toys and things
""
not for their husbands or their boy friends but for themselves
""
so when you come in i am not surprised
""
""
ya some of my friends do that too
""
""
ya ya it is nice
""
uhm uhm some of the girls they like return of the jedi
""
especially the cute little guys the ewoks
""
""
ya ya
""
""
you know about that right
""
""
i saw the cartoons
""
""
so what these what they do is that buy all the ewoks and they
create a scene all from there and i have a special special play set over here
called the ewok village that i import from the states
""
and it is not it will not be made
""
it has not been made it has stopped manufacturing ewok village for
a long long time but i get in through them quite quite all right about fifty
dollars
""
""
for how many
""
""
it just that ewok village with all the play sets
""
let me show you let me show you
""
""
okay it should be interesting
""
""
ya like you see the net here the fireplace you know all the
place they stay in
""
and you got traps here and things like that
""
catapults you know the place where they place the catapults the
tree trunks and things like that
""
so you can get all the ewoks and put on it and you can get your
own little scenario is nice
""
""
ya
""
""
and they and they kenner has made things that are very
unusual lah you know
""
there is that like this is a combat glider
""
you know the part that you see in return of the jedi where ewok
was on a glider and he threw stones on the chicken walkers and there are so
many other things
""
so that is one way you can start with
""
""
i see
""
""
ya ya or another way is that you go with your favourite
characters
""
what are the characters in star wars movies that you really like
""
i have a friend a lady friend who likes princess leia a lot
""
""
ya
""
""
ya and she comes in different uhm different uniforms and
clothes and dresses and things like that
""
so what she does is that she only buys the princess leias
""
all different things or she buys the twelve dolls she buys all the
figures with princess leia
""
so she sticks with this
""
""
i think it cost quite a lot right if i am not wrong
""
""
no if you go by theme in this way if you go by a certain
scenario in this way it cost much less
""
""
i see
""
""
rather than to start from scratch and you buy everything
there is and you can't even find some of the things and i tell you some of
the things uhm they don't make now and they are very very expensive
""
like i have here maybe this particular luke skywalker with the
long sabre
""
""
ya
""
""
when they first made it they made the long sabre and it is
not proportional with the with the size of the figures
""
""
ya i heard about it
""
""
ya ya so if you want to get back all these collectors' item
they are very difficult to find
""
but in another way if you are not particular about this
""
they're made this using short light sabre
""
and uhm they don't cost a bomb
""
they cost about ten bucks each
""
""
i see
""
""
easily manageable so you have to decide where where you want
to start with
""
""
i see okay
""
what about aliens uh
""
""
oh aliens okay
""
i know about aliens a lot because uh believe it or not i didn't
start with star wars when i started collection
""
i actually started with aliens
""
""
i see
""
i like the shows a lot you know
""
""
ya the movies are great right
""
""
ya but i know the toys are very rare now
""
you cannot get it anywhere
""
""
oh ya very difficult to get
""
""
do you sell them by the way
""
""
i do i do
""
i do sell them and sometimes on and off i try to locate them from
overseas and i try to bring them in to singapore
""
because there's still a lot of collectors are there who are very
keen on aliens stuff
""
""
ya ya ya
""
i like the show very much
""
""
ya i love it too
""
and incidentally that's how i started toy collection
""
""
from aliens
""
""
from aliens ya
""
so so we have talked a lot so are you going to get today or do you
want to wait another day to get
""
""
uhm probably another day lah
""
""
another day
""
""
i have to think about what i really want
""
""
correct
""
so thing remember to me toys you know always bring people together
""
that to me is the important thing about toys so
""
""
that is nice
""
""
ya don't be too interested in the values uhm the you know the
market price of the toy and things like that
""
it take away the joy out of it
""
get it get something that you really like
""
something that reminds you of the good old days bring back
memories or something that you really like in a movie like star wars scenes
and things like that
""
get those
""
get things that are closer to your heart
""
""
okay
""
""
instead of getting things that people tell you to get because
they are very good price because next time would fetch a good price
""
next time would fetch a higher price
""
""
no it is not that reason i like toys
""
""
ya it's not fun at all
""
""
ya
""
""
don't do that like for me when i was young how i get into
toys was this
""
i don't have much money so my parents only very occasionally buy
me one or two star wars toys and i play them and play them over and over
again and i still have them and i keep them as memories and things like that
""
and when i grew up i told myself that when i start to earn money
again i would go back to collect the things the toys that i really really
like
""
so that's what toys mean are to me
""
""
i see
""
""
memories the good old days and things that i really like and
it brings people together
""
so remember this when you think about the toys
""
""
okay
""
""
ya
""
""
thanks a lot
""
""

""
""
