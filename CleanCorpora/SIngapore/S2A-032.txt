hi good morning
""
uhm can you all do me a favour and stand up and stretch because i
know how awful it is to sit for a whole hour
""
stand up oh collin very good collin
""
okay make sure that you're ready to loosen up because i'm going to
show an r(a  movie
""
now alright i was looking through your programme i think you all can
sit down now was looking through your programme and i noticed how intensive
it is and it's really is heavy weight subject
""
so i thought oh give these kids a break
""
let's show an r(a  movie uh sex and violence you know women being
raped in bosnia the khmer rouge killing the un peace keepers you know
""
but i and then i was reminded that you all are below eighteen and
that's why i have to snipped off a lot of the sex and violence
""
so what's left is ten minute video on journalism which is about as
good because there's some violence in it
""
so i hope you all would enjoy it
""
it will give you an idea about what journal journalism is about and
and later on i will uhm give you some uh uh a few tips on what takes to write
well in journalism okay
""
well i hope you enjoyed that show a bit of a hard sell ha
""
but i hope i think it gives you all a very good idea about what
journalism is about and the difference worlds that you have to be very in
tune in uhm in not only in singapore but what's happening abroad
""
what's happening uhm in china in soviet union in uhm now russia and
uh england anywhere
""
so what i'm going to do is uhm is to give you a micro and to a
macro view of the things you should be tuned in
""
uhm and i think the most important thing is as journalist to be
tuned into the written word
""
it's the tool of the trade okay
""
like uhm somebody ask me what's so creative about journalism that
you know you want to talk about it in the creative arts programme
""
but i think uhm like playwrights like novelists like poets we deal
with the written word
""
uhm do you think i can have one that never mind i'm not used to
standing still like this
""
you can hear me
""
do i have to off this
""
okay can you hear me ya
""
those behind can you hear me
""
okay thanks okay
""
uhm how do we use words to convey what you want you know what we
observe probably find out
""
that's where creativity comes in and i'll like to think of words
like so many horses you know like uhm like the poet they probably the horse
is probably uhm the show horse where they they re-prance?? the horse around
with accessories you know
""
they'll groom them they're in no hurry to get to the finishing line
""
uhm and the playwright and the novelist you can gallop across
meadows of im imagination
""
you can even make the horse fly uhm you can even help uh pimples on
the on the horse if you want you know
""
so in the playwright use words different and you can imagine thing
bestow things onto people that they don't have
""
uhm but for the the journalist the the word is is primary a work
horse
""
you have to work it real hard
""
uhm you write it out only for a purpose to inform to educate to
stimulate thought or to entertain
""
that's what journalists are for to do these four main functions
""
i repeat to inform to educate to stimulate thought and to entertain
""
and it's often a race
""
you can't afford like to meander around the meadows and uh gaze at
the trees and look at the stars you know
""
you just have to get to the finishing line fast or else the
magazines and the weeklies which are on sale are like donkeys or goats you
know
""
they will overtake you and it'll be very embarrassing if you're a
newspaper journalist
""
uhm so no matter how how you love the written word no matter how
and and many are like collin you know
""
he's he's a journalist and he loves words the way i do and but then
you have to uhm subsume that love you have to be a master over your words
""
you cannot be a slave to the written word
""
so you every word must count on a page and that's where i feel
different from playwrights or fits?? a a novelist where where uhm you let
words take its own life
""
okay so this is one of the major challenges of uhm this journalism
""
i'm not?? showing you some slides i'm very low tech
""
how do you work this
""
it took me a long time even to uhm operate my my computer
""
magic okay you know alright i think
""
okay now if if uhm if you're not sure what what count for as a
journalist imagine if this is your front page
""
you wake up in the morning and you take a copy of the straits times
take a cup of the coffee and this is your front page and this was a front
page of the straits times in 1865
""
imagine reading that
""
where do you start
""
and what is it about
""
where is the headline you know
""
uhm and and actually they're talking about the budget you know and
and they gives detail about uh what happen at at the budget
""
but uhm who will read it
""
if today do you think anybody buy would buy a front page like this
""
so you have to be very very tune in to society to the habits of
your readers to uhm what people want to read
""
and so if you put word all over the page you are no journalist
""
ah uhm another example of the front page of the straits times
""
aren't you glad we evolved
""
so what happen here was that they put advertisements on the front
page not information yah
""
and it's very interesting
""
i was so amuse when i was doing my research because can you can you
see them quite small ha
""
there's one about milk goats veer?? veer?? veer?? veer?? veer??
""
they have two gu gujerat?? milk goats with three kids all excellent
conditions
""
apply to the printer of this paper
""
they were selling goats on the front page of the straits times
""
so so newspapers change journalists change with the times you know
so you have to always be on top of things and and words are are not the only
things that you can convey what you want to convey as a journalist
""
so you have to be tuned into the ? ? what you want the words to do
for you and the that doesn't mean flooding the whole front page with words
""
uhm and it means giving information and not only and and not only
advertisements on the front page
""
and you also have to be tuned into what's happening around you
""
uhm you've to be tuned into the details of things that are
happening around you and to be to be a good writer in journalism it's quite
different from being a good reporter
""
but i believe that uhm to be a good writer in journal you have to
be a good reporter first you know
""
you you must be interested in what's happening around you
""
uhm the more you the more you work to make your writing perceptive
insightful stimulating and moving the more you learn to write so that you can
capture everything that's happening around you and you present it to the
world you know
""
you present it to your readers to hood it up for their imagination
""
but you have to notice the mole on her cheek you have to uhm you
have to notice whether she she was she actually uhm she look really sad and
then the wrinkles that're on her eyes you know
""
uhm what turn into a tight fan when she was telling you about how
her husband died you know
""
uhm uhm you have to notice uhm details like if she she tells you
he's a ? ? that
""
once i i interviewed this guy who was accused of raping a girl and
he says no no no
""
uhm i uhm he he he maintained that the gi uhm the girl agreed to
having relations with him and at the end wanted to give him trouble and cried
rape and he was sitting there saying i had sex with forty women in my whole
life
""
he's about forty years old and he was wearing this china t-shirt
with uhm made in china slippers you know and ? ? with trousers with holes and
he was telling me
""
oh i drive a sports car and women like me because i'm like a hong
kong superstar you know
""
and he was there you know with china t-shirt
""
so you have to match reality with what is being told to you and
that's come from being a good journalist
""
you not only hear what people are telling you but you match it with
what you see
""
so you've to be very tuned in to to the details of uh the people
you're talking to or to the surroundings
""
so i feel that the writer sees better and more clearly than the
non-writer
""
if you're if you love words and i'm sure you all do being creative
people you find that you'd be even a better reporter if if you go there as
someone who loves words
""
and even as the event you're covering unfolds be a parliament
session
""
you know where i've got to sit through for six hours or a murder or
a big fire you have always to be tuned in to what's going on
""
you must be thinking about how to write you know
""
you can't like sit down and said well switch off and then i'll i'll
get codes later on and i'll come back to the office and i'll just it'll come
it'll come you know
""
it doesn't work that way
""
you have to think on your feet you know
""
even as ministers let's say are giving their speeches in parliament
then you have to be consciously thinking what are the points he's making
""
is he worth any space you know uh what's his argument is it
""
is it valid if it's you know false?? and and you must know as good
writers you must know that writing is more than putting words on a page
""
good writing is a process of observing digesting thinking and
explaining
""
uhm and for for for features you must think in terms of not only
of writing but you must also think in terms of from one thought to the other
""
and you have to think in terms of endings as well as the headings
""
how you start the story what we call intro
""
you must also think in terms of the endings
""
the endings give a sense of completion to the reader
""
i'll give an example of a recent feature i did just publish
yesterday
""
uhm it was about old folk's homes
""
uhm their they're they take up a whole floor of a hdb block and
now they're expanding to a second floor you know and lives?? in ang mio kio
""
and i'm sure you all know about the case in dover park hospice you
know and uhm the st andrew hospital for the elderly where the all the
neighbours made a lot of noise about having these old people nearby
""
they think they're sick and dying
""
no we don't want to catch their uhm their diseases you know
""
they don't want to be expose to death when they're so young in
their prime of health
""
uhm so with this new expansion of this elderly in this hdb block
in ang mio kio
