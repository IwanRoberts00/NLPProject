can i have your first question please kube from wan san news agency my question is to you clement de souza now in your interview with the sbc radio on election morning you are quoted as saying that you wouldn't mind losing one or two single seat constituencies now four opposition candidates have come in is this because the opposition candidates were better qualified than the pap candidates or is it a sign that singaporeans want an opposition in parliament well i have decided that singaporeans have uh taken up mr chiam's argument that you need to have opposition in parliament to check the government it's also a sign that uh the candidates there are comparable to ours and the electorate have returned those candidates who in their view appear to be good mps whether it is indeed so will be seen when these mps take up their duties we are convinced that we have had good candidates and we fielded the best team we could find the electorate felt that the opposition candidates were plausible that they spoke well and they presented themselves well and decided to give them a try well we'll see what they can do  question in chinese  uh i'll try to understand the best i can in english and if i miss out on some points uh either teng cheong or loong can answer you possibly in uh mandarin uh you wanted to know uh what is this work of psychology frankly speaking i find it difficult to understand good economic growth no difficult issues programmes which have benefited the people not just over the last three years but over the last 26 years and that this should be the outcome i also thought that the belief in this open consultative style of government and that they were encouraging me and my programme and yet the percentage has gone down and we've lost uh 4 seats but for those 4 seats which we have lost if we going into details perhaps there are local reasons it is understandable if there's this mood for wanting to have some plausible opposition members of parliament so i can understand why we lost uh hougang bukit gombak of course potong pasir and uh yishun central but uh i cannot understand the results in eunos there is not a case of 4 strong candidates against us we have two ministers of state in eunos dr tay eng soon sidek saniff and two very good mps charles chong and chew eng chee chew eng chee has been working on the ground for many years and it's eunos which worries me not bukit gombak or hougang because if i'm sure if we look into the reasons in detail we can find an explanation but eunos as of now i just cannot understand and i'm fearful 'cos i cannot understand i've challenged uh jufrie openly on the use of religion and race to win votes pkam pkms candidates also invoked religion and they had had a good votes too so i think the signal has been given to many people outside that the use of communal and religious pulls can win you votes that's what i'm more worried about tonight apprehensive about the future that the loss of 3 or 4 seats where there could be an explanation now whether there will be any change of government policy well i think we would have to review what we want to do uh obviously i would not see moving my programmes so decisively so quickly it's not possible i got to try to read the message do they support the programme and i would have to modify the programme if necessary whether the grassroots are still strong in touch with the ground oh ah our grassroots are still strong they're in touch with the ground i move around too uh i could sense this time to see that the mood was good people are friendly they wave to me as i drove uh along i i looked up the flat and they waved to me malay indians chinese all very friendly and yet this is the result so i got to try and understand what they are signaling us two questions sir first looking deeper at the election results do you see some signals from the chinese voters especially the chinese educated looking at the results in hougang in nee shun in yishun do you see some signals that they are not happy with some of the government policies i can't come to a conclusion uh now but uh low thia kiang is a bilingual candidate speaks good english speaks good mandarin communicates effectively and he's a teochew hougang has a lot of teochew i believe that could be a factor because in his in his rally speeches he used teochew to reach out to the population over there tan guan seng is also a bilingual in english and mandarin but he couldn't speak to them in teochew so that's one obvious factor but there could be other factors that i'll have to look into yes how would this effect your calling for a by-election well i've said i would hold by-elections within 12 to 18 months i would still plan a by-elections uh let us have one more and it'll be quite complete uh mr goh eunos factor how much of it could have been due to feeling amongst malay voters that you've came up too hard against him for instance the use of inshallah and so on in the speeches by jufrie you see that's what worries me because if i don't come down hard on a candidate using communal line then they would have gone even much further in this election and because i came down hard that put a stop to it i do not know about this use of inshaallah whether that annoyed the malays or not uh i mean i don't quite understand fully uh the proper occasions to use such phrases maybe it's annoyed quite a few people uh wong kan seng's remarks could have perhaps caused some misunderstanding on on on a the use of such religious phrases but could you imagine when the crowd is excited after listening to a to a to a rally speech and then the use of religious phrases i think that could evoke very strong gut feel in the malays i'm not saying that the use of the phrases is wrong but i'm saying that in the right in the wrong occasion it could lead to more problems so far as we can tell because we brought this out into the open and took a strong stand against jufrie the ground move in our favour the ground meaning both the chinese voters as well as the malay voters if we had not done it i think we would clearly have lost eunos and the consequences would have been even worse for singapore i agree with that observation we would have lost eunos had we had not moved strongly jufrie's line of politicking can i say a few words on this yah when i commented on jufrie's use of uh inshallah and halam durillah one reporter asked me whether it's really wrong i said that when used in the right context when used in the right context it's really the nothing wrong but in a rally when you're appealing to the gut feels the emotional fulls of the malays and using a rousing speeches talking about religion talking about appealing to the communal feelings that's a very dangerous line to take i did clarify that point  question in mandarin   laugh as i've said in the campaign you cannot have your cake and eat it a vote for the opposition is for the opposition is a vote against my style of government because as i told them in this election i was the issue and i was contesting in every seat i wanted to have this clear mandate from the people for my style of government that's very clear we joined issue over there mr chiam campaigned on the basis that they should return more opposition members into parliament i was campaigning on the basis that if you do that you are not giving me support and i did put it to that that you cannot have your cake and eat it you got to choose and they've chosen more opposition mps so i have to review what is it that they are signaling me and more important whether my style will win the pap more votes in future no matter how popular it is to the people there is such a thing called bottom line this style has caused me 4 seats this time will it cause me another 4 seats in future as i've said both during the campaign and earlier on when i made my introductory remarks personally i'll be very reluctant to change this open consultative style it's part of me i believe in it i still want to involve people in government but to say that i would go back and reflect upon this and modify my style i think would be telling you a lie i certainly would    19 mar ' 92 fm 90.5  from the first games held in 1968 in chicago usa the special olympics movement has grown to include over eighty countries today started by eunice kennedy shraiver on the belief that intellectually disabled people can be trained to enjoy and compete in sports the movement provides year round training and athletics competition but the movement relies entirely on volunteers and private organisations so does it face a problem with getting enough of either jane ong has been talking to the chairman of special olympics international sergeant shraiver??  sergeant shraiver  so are you saying that since 1968 when the movement started you've never had any problems with volunteers coaches helpers to help train the these people  sergeant shraiver  what about the participants themselves you have no problem with volunteers but with the participants are the people willing to come forward to take part  sergeant shraiver  what so why do you think that has changed why do more uhm men mentally handicap people come forward now to join in the the movement  sergeant shraiver  do you think the special olympics uh movement has anything to do with this change about changing perception of what an an intellectually disabled person can do and cannot do  sergeant shraiver  well singapore has been sending representatives to the games since 1983 jane ong also talked to the president of special olympics singapore robin chua to find out whether volunteers are as easy to come by as sergeant shraiver said at the moment uhm have problem with getting the right kind of volunteers volunteers that do has a specific knowledge on a certain sports we certainly would like to have volunteer in this area volunteers uh in the other areas like uh administration management uhm we do not have any difficulty getting such volunteers so what we have been uh doing uh at the moment is that uh we have encouraged more people from the school of uh physical education to come forth to help us and we are uhm quite successful in that area what about the response from the intellectually disabled uh children here are they coming forth to take part in the games yes at the moment the bulk of the training uh is given to students who are already in our special schools uhm what we are trying to do uh uhm is to reach out to those who have already gone out to work uhm but there are certain constraints like uh getting uh time-off from uhm employers uh fitting into their training schedule with their their work schedule uh so there are certain constraints in it in that area but we have already lot of few of them who has already gone out for open employment to come back for training and we're able to do that say in on on a saturday afternoons on sundays  so the response has been good you would say yes definitely uhm it it has caught on uhm we are really encourage by this especially uhm those athletes that has gone to many place when they came back we noticed a certain subtle change in them they're becoming uh social competent they are more friendly they make friends very easily they could make friends to passengers on the plane you know you it's really fantastic robin chua on the change in special at at olympics participants well on that encouraging note we end this morning's am singapore tomorrow we'll be having bonnie hicks into the studio to talk about her latest book discuss disgust so don't forget to tune in from producer karen won and the rest of the team i'm pek siok lian signing off have a good day
