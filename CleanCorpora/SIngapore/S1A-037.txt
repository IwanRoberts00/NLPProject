""
""
okay what about your arbitration case
""
maybe you can tell me about that or is that so hush hush that
""
""
it's so hush hush that no one outside of the whole of
 word  knows about it and that's about three hundred
people
""
""
ya sure uhm
""
so how
""
""
uhm
""
""
some other case
""
wouldn't okay
""
""
well
""
well uhm
""
we're going for a raid this wednesday
""
""
sh cartoon how can you tell people that
""
""
a raid a raid you know a raid as in
""
""
 word 
""
""
no we're going for a search warrant
""
you know arrest
""
""
search warrant of a warrant of arrest
""
""
no
""
""
no no
""
what am i saying
""
""
warrant of arrest is hawaii five-o
""
""
no you can go for a warrant of arrest if if a person defaults
in appearance
""
""
ya right
""
""
uh warrant to search and seize
""
""
warrant to search and seize that's right
""
that's what we're doing on wednesday
""
""
oh
""
""
uh really
""
there are some counter features of our clients' fabric design
""
""
kind of difficult right
""
on what basis
""
""
copyright uh
""
""
copyright infringement
""
""
ya
""
i mean i've seen the two design uh the colours are very similar
""
but the designs i see uh not exactly alike  word
 substantially alike
""
""
so  word 
""
""
i mean one look from far uh looks like the same material
""
but when you examine it closely and you're looking for differences
you can find
""
""
if you're not
""
""
if you're not one cursory glance if you're really observant
""
""
won't make a difference still
""
""
then you you will be able to
""
you even if you are 'cause if even if you're very observant cursory
glance you may not find it
""
""
really
""
""
ya but you have to look for the difference
""
""
okay
""
""
probably you can
""
""
but it but it happened to my client once you know
""
where they called me up and started screaming saying that one of
the departmental stores were actually selling uh the fabric uh
""
""
uh uh
""
""
uh that was similar to theirs and the reason why they were so
uptight was because uh it was their summer collection
""
it was they were going to launch it and was already found in
another departmental store
""
uh so you know they actually went to buy up
""
""
actually went to buy up every
""
""
they actually went to i mean they went to that departmental
store and bought up the stocks
""
and then of course subsequently they spoke to the 'cause they were
going to launch that design
""
so it would really spoil the market apparently
""
and but i compared the thing i couldn't tell the difference
""
i brought it home you know and my mother could tell the difference
""
she said texture-wise is different style print
""
""
why didn't you go for your warrant of seizure and or search
and and
""
""
no
""
the problem is that
""
look uhm this one may not even beat the counterfeit because the
fabric may come from the same source
""
so it's there is no copyright infringement
""
""
right
""
""
it is the same garment
""
same quality
""
""
it's a breach of contract
""
""
so it's a breach of contract which doesn't warrant a seizure
you see
""
""
uh uh no no hey am i  word  
""
""
""
you mean there are flats above saint michael's
""
""
yeah
""
it's a nice little flat two bedrooms
""
""
you mean saint michael's in holland village
""
""
yeah
""
""
oh i didn't even know there are two-storey flats
""
""
there are flats up there and the the entrance is at the back
of saint michael's
""
""
so that's where sweet secrets and stuff like that
""
""
above there right
""
but this flat is nearer the road uhm next to goh seng huat
""
""
oh you meant the electrical shop
""
""
uhm
""
""
ah okay
""
""
so the entrance to the flat is uhm at that back of the bank
tat lee bank or whatever bank
""
""
how big is the flat how many bedrooms and
""
""
two bedrooms uhm good size sitting room
""
i didn't see the kitchen
""
it's a nice little cozy flat
""
""
what made her moved out of her flat
""
""
because she she can't uhm live in university property
""
she's joined ie
""
""
oh i see
""
""
and ie doesn't provide housing
""
""
allowance
""
there's housing allowance
""
""
oh but you'll have to search for your own flats
""
don't they have some quarters uhm like near ngee ann 
word 
""
""
i think so
""
they're for visiting visiting professors or people on exchange
""
""
or in college green
""
what about college green
""
""
those are still university housing
""
""
so after that when we went to to eat at chinese shop opposite
saint michael's
""
so that's when you met chandran and suresh
""
they were coming to join us
""
""
oh i i thought they had been jogging
""
oh father and son jogging i see
""
""
they don't go jogging together
""
""
do they go jogging separately
""
""
yes chandran doesn't go so often and suresh tries to go once
or twice a week
""
""
 word 
""
""
now he's got flab around his stomach that won't go away you
know
""
""
so how was the food anyway in this friend's shop
""
""
chinese food
""
not bad you know that joint
""
""
which shop is it
""
it's not the uhm hawker centre opposite the uh
""
""
corner coffee shop
""
""
opposite saint michael's
""
""
do you remember
""
is it a restaurant
""
""
it is a restaurant
""
""
and they have satay
""
""
they have satay
""
recently that man i saw
""
""
 word 
""
""
it's quite good
""
is it
""
""
the satay is good
""
""
really
""
but no one talked to me about this stall unless it's by
""
is it by a malay
""
""
his satay is malay
""
""
oh i see
""
""
he was there before and he used to sell satay on outside the
shop and he got chased away a number of times
""
it seems like illegal so he went away
""
then after a while he'll come back and try again
""
the health authority to come down upon him then he would go away
again
""
""
so now he's got his own stall
""
""
but this time there is there used to be a stall in the shop
selling popiah
""
it seems the rent went up to three thousand for the stall so that
man moved away
""
the satay seller has taken over so he can afford the rent
""
""
three thousand
""
""
three thousand
""
""
expensive just for a stall
""
""
yeah
""
""
not even like a shophouse or something more
""
""
there's a there's a new banana leaf uh restaurant chellah
""
""
yeah
""
""
where
""
""
it's uhm next to the times bookshop
""
""
oh also in holland village
""
""
also in holland village
""
""
okay
""
""
have you been there
""
""
uhm i've been to take away like  word 
""
""
first time we went
""
""
it's okay but it's very south indian
""
it's not what you know north indian type
""
it's more south indian dhall and
""
""
it's more like the race course road
""
""
that's right
""
""
apollo and
""
""
muthu's and all that
""
they have fish head which i see it's uh and they have 
word 
""
but then it's air-con you know
""
i can't imagine sitting in with air-con eating my  word
""
""
body will  word  of uh
""
""
in apollo you've done you've done
""
""
doesn't
""
""
but i am intrigued by this uhm malay man who started up a
chinese restaurant
""
""
malay man
""
chinese
""
where
""
""
didn't you see that
""
i mean that uh this person who uh sell satay
""
""
oh but he's always been there
""
""
but he he's
""
""
he doesn't run the whole restaurant i notice
""
""
he only serves
""
""
oh okay
""
""
he only serves satay and he uses disposable bowls and plates
""
but he doesn't have to do any washing what
""
""
and also  word 
""
depends on how depends on how fussy you are
""
if it's there's muslim food it's muslim food lah where i'm
concerned
""
""
are you quite strict about that
""
""
i know antonia might say
""
i suppose i am
""
i suppose if there's a choice between muslim and a non-muslim
""
i wouldn't go for a muslim but uh in singapore it's quite
difficult to prevent
""
""
aye how do you make dosai
""
""
i haven't made dosai for so long
""
in fact i made a mistake once
""
i was coming from kl i threw away some of my pots and pans and
those were the best ones you know
""
they were the seasoned one you know but they looked so ugly
""
i throw them away and in fact even i miss them because they were
seasoned and
""
""
aluminium
""
""
ya the old type
""
""
people say aluminium is to be avoided
""
""
they cause alzheimer
""
""
and what's that
""
""
uhm
""
""
what's alzheimer
""
""
alzheimer disease
""
""
a disease of the brain in which your brain cells are attacked
or die
""
""
then you become
""
""
totally confused
""
you don't recognise your children
""
""
it's not the alzheimer's alzheimer's i thought alzoner's
alsaimer's
""
""
i thought it was alzheimer's alzheimer's disease
""
""
alzheimer's
""
but it's spelt a l z h
""
""
ya a l z and then h l is a high but i don't know
""
that's how i pronounce it
""
i don't know
""
""
i've never heard it said so i
""
""
ya i think i have heard it said but i can't remember
""
they have they have a programme once uhm sbc i think
""
that they showed this old man looking after his wife who had what
i called alzheimer's disease and they always they've been saying my mother
 word 
""
""
really
""
""
at one stage at one stage she nearly was  word
 but i don't  word 
""
""
it's not just simple forgetfulness
""
it's uh it involves disorientation
""
""
ya but are when you are a certain age i think you'll get
disorient disoriented
""
""
that's right you can't see
""
""
you can't see but you're not sure why you see
""
""
there are many types of severity
""
it could be senile and not forget and not remember people
""
but you don't do odd things or think that you're son is a thief or
something
""
""
i think what sometime old people do that you know like they
they misplace things and they will accuse everybody around them
""
""
that's right
""
if they can't find they'll say oh somebody has taken it
""
""
or they act very irrationally like uh do very strange things
in the house
""
""
 word  medically you know and the doctor
sort of sacrifice
""
""
they can be mistaken for to be mad because of the weird
things they do
""
""
got tied up you know  word 
""
""
that's why a lot of people want their old folks at home
""
don't want them to run around then forget their address and unable
to get back home
""
""
it's not really so cruel as people think
""
we'll have no idea what we'll be like that when we get old
""
""
true
""
""
what a depressing subject
""
""
yes
""
""
you can please move on from considering disease
""
""
we can on back to food
""
""

""
""
