okay can we start now uhm thanks uhm okay so uh lay kuan uhm uhm meng choo says uh meng meng choo wanted me to to ask you when you might be free so that we can get together and have lunch uhm uhm uhm when when will will you be free actually my good days are wednesdays and thursdays uhm uhm uh wednesday i finish at eleven and then i have nothing in the afternoon wow ya that's why i like wednesdays and thursdays i have uh till one o'clock and then i have nothing after that nothing after that does she have a fixed lunch hour well uh she's flexible uhm so so the only hitch is that uhm she she would have to arrange for somebody to look after her son uh if she go out for lunch oh oh i see so that's why we have to make arrangements beforehand oh i thought she always goes back for lunch does she no then i i what do you mean by having to get someone to look after it's as though she's back every time for lunch oh i don't know i really don't know what her arrangements are like okay okay uh but in any case uh well it sounds like thursday is a good time uhm uhm because uhm thursday is good for you it's good for me because i finish my lab class at twelve o'clock ah ah and then i don't start again until two o'clock uhm uhm so in between i have two hours so that would be a good time oh okay thursday meng meng choo was thinking whether we should go to the guild house uhm for lunch which one the the the nus guild house ah ah uh what do you think okay guild house is alright is she a member i think she is because we can't go in unless unless we're members or rather we can't eat there unless one of them one of them is a member i don't know if her membership has lapsed though but some time back ya i have another idea it's also word good it's also related to or associated with guild house uhm uhm uhm it's at adam road okay and just after or ya just after this bible college uhm there's a lane going to the left uhm there's a slope up to this uh colonial-looking house right right is there a restaurant ya and there's a restaurant up there oh i didn't know that ya it's very homely in that sense that it's it's those old fashioned house the chinese call it bukalau type of house you know uhm uhm and it has uhm it's wood uh wooden type of uh flooring uhm irene tan brought us there once uhm uhm and and is it terribly expensive no not at all it's just slightly more expensive than let's say hawker place ya what what sort of food do they serve there but it's pleasant a range uh local as well as western you know ya uhm local you can order the dishes or you can order individual ones uhm oh okay that's that's good that's another place uh oh how did this come about actually you went to oh i i just went to see meng choo about something else uhm uhm uhm and then at the end she said oh i must we must have lunch together have lunch together ya and she said then then she thought of you uhm uhm and then she said oh must must ask lay kuan along uhm uhm orh so i said okay ya okay ya uh uh i'll check with lay kuan ya and then get back to her and tell her when you might be free uhm uhm uhm you let me know which thursday because then i can change i have this same class from ten to eleven and then twelve to one uhm there's a one there's a an hour of lapse can change okay okay so what i can do is uh push it down uhm uhm sometimes i continue if if they still feel up to it or if i prepare them for it we continue and then we don't have that hour from twelve to one uhm oh ya that's okay okay i'll i'll so both of us will finish at eleven then this is what on nuh this is on nuh thursday did you say thursday word  thursday well i finish at twelve o'clock ah ah okay so so ya can if i shift my class then i'll finish at twelve o'clock oh would you okay okay then then we can go ya ya thursday alright i'll i'll ask meng choo but would that inconvenience you oh no not at all and also uh probably one week or two later they're getting into tests the tests for interviews oh ya which means that we won't be having formal classes and i'll be testing some other classes so the time-table will be different then i see so thursday is good okay okay then then we'll i will set it at thursday tentatively do you do you teach the second and third years too well i i teach the second years uhm uh eln2 owc oh okay yap so which means that in another one or two they are they are doing interviews too no they're doing uh role-plays no they're not ah okay because i in two or three weeks' time they'll be they'd have finished they would have finished how many hours word  what the the word the eln2 two hours a week two hours but just just one class no i've got let me see uh i've got three classes three classes word  uhm uhm so how do you find your students which group your your second and third years the ah ya the both are bm uhm uhm uh i like the second years very much probably because everything is organised and i i know the syllabus uhm uhm uh pretty well and so uhm and and i think plus the fact or major factor is that they're very uhm uh co-operative uhm uhm and diligent and they're fun at the same time such that when when we have light light things they they all uhm take part and they're very responsive uhm uhm and when their actual work comes uh hard work they they get down to work too they get down to work ya so i enjoy that group very much the third years uh for some reason or other i don't seem to enjoy the class very much uh which course is that both are bm oh don't i know i understand because the the third year syllabus tend to be uhm a little bit more uh more fragmented i think because more fragmented than than the second years uhm uhm uhm than the second years uh ya actually i quite enjoy teaching grammar uhm uhm uhm uhm and that's why i enjoy teaching the first years  word even thouh everybody find it such a drag you know uhm uhm you know ya ya but uhm actually i think it's it's quite a good course in that you you you get them to you know probably for the last time in their lives uhm uhm they will have somebody to they will have something to guide them to guide them and tell them you know such a uh uh word  stringent ya amendment ya because after that it's really free for all kind of thing so ya true and i think they need the basics ya they all do ya even though some of them speak well they they still get down to all the uhm nitty gritty problems uhm uhm in language uhm uhm and i also like the first years for the fact that when they come they're all new to the whole environment yes yes and they stick to each other quite well yes and so and so the class is cohesive ya and i like to teach a cohesive class uhm because they all one for all and all for one for one kind of feeling and and it's fun this way yes right i i i have that feeling also ya and also third third years tend to be more responsive no first years tend to be more responsive responsive ya whereas the second years they're all jaded and cynical somewhat yes yes yes ya and they know the tricks of the trade like how many times to be absent absent and how to irritate you but otherwise ya and i always find first years more uh more appreciative yes uhm ya whereas the second years tend to be a little more they they more indifferent ya towards the teacher they rely a little bit more on you maybe that's why it makes me feel good too because this' their first year and they don't know about things like uh uh rules or regulations uhm and and and what how to go about this and that uhm and it it feels good that they depend on you or on the class as a whole uhm uhm and that's why they do come to class with more ya expectations and ya look uh with more anticipation ya uhm that's why  word  and also second years when they move up to the second year they do change groups they do change the grouping is it yes and then they don't they they have to make friends all over ya ya and then so usually if one of two friends go up with them they just clique with these two uhm uhm yes and then two or three others from another group stay  word yes and then i i don't like it this way when they don't mix well and co-operate yes yes and then when it comes to final year they are they become quite individualistic oh ya ya because all they want to do is to get out of the place get out of the place finish the project and then you know ya ya and also then again more street-wise too more street-wise campus-wise ya then i hear i i i always get to uhm to you know listen to all these complaints about ya what group word  ah yes yes people who can't work with each other yes and uh yes and quite a few times i have to mediate you know oh between that uh between them in their quarrels ya and help uhm ya the second years the the third years mainly the third years because i used to teach the third years bms usually projects ya so every time they have a project you get one or two who are not very co-operative uhm uhm makes life difficult for the others oh ya uhm and and this year we are told to assess them uh or rather one component is peer assessment uhm and i hated it when i have to call up one person and say and like oh you tell me about that group hey like gossiping i feel so i'm ya i feel as though i'm encouraging them to tell uh tell tale about each other tale but i guess but how do they respond do they tell on each other actually it's i have to i have to do they take that opportunity to ya i've always to to to set the whole perspective right you see you know you you mustn't think that is a friend just tell me objectively whether whether you like or dislike the person just tell me whether the person does contribute fairly or not you know i keep having to set this scenario before they tell me things and so what happens do do they actually gossip it's okay they no i think they they straighten up and they realise it's their responsibility uh to to to tell the right thing  uhm uhm uhm so they do tell me if some are not working hard uhm and also i match that with my own observation i see ya when when they discuss and i in fact sometimes i'm more prejudiced i i feel that certain people are not contributing but when this person come and say: oh ya he or she does uhm so i have to change my own uh uh assessment too uhm uhm uhm
