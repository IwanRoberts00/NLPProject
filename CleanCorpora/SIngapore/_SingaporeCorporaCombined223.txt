good afternoon uh ladies and gentlemen my name uh is ding hock hui i'm a senior quantity surveyor from the quantative surveying uh office in p w d so i'll be talking on uh quantity surveying services if you join uh p w d uh as quantity surveyors what you will do in p w d i think most of us are familiar with this uh organisation chart typical projecting uh where you have the client the architect contractor sub-contractors as well as a range of uh consultants that uh involve in the job appointed by the client to get a project going so the quantity surveyor as you can see is one of the project uh consultants involve in the job uh assisting the architect and you may have other allied professionals like structural civil engineers uhm mechanical and electrical engineers as well as uh other specialist consultants could have for interior design consultant  word consultant who are involve in the job this is the project team who will handle the project right from the outset the project team objective basically as far as i can see uh centred around uh three areas time control cost control and quality control you try to get the project completed on time within a specified uh programme within uh certain budgeted cost as well as to certain uh quality standard and what is the quantity surveyor's role basically is to safeguard uh government financial interest to make sure that uh money are well spent for the project and also to ensure that the public construction contract are procured in compliance with certain regulations uh which uh the main in purpose of this regulation is to ensure that the projects are procured lah with uh in accordance with uh certain rules so that they are transparent nobody can fault them and uh complain can be uh answered easily what then are the q s functions if you're employed as a quantity surveyor in p w d these are the basic functions that uh you probably be performing you'll be making uh cost estimates plans or cost plans for a project you work the estimated cost for budgeting purposes once uh the estimates are approved the money is allocated you proceed to call tenders that means you prepare your tender documents you will uh proceed to call tenders after the documents have been prepared lah in certain cases for large projects you'll have this p q we call it prequalification exercises that means uh contractors will be pre-qualified tenders we will narrow down contractors to those who are qualified to be invited to tender after tenders are called we have this tender evaluation recommendation of the tender to the client and uh after the tenders have been approved it is awarded to the successful contractor and uh fol following then we have contract documentation uh we document a contract that will be the basis to to base uh to to work out the contractual arrangement between a contractor and p w d and uh after the award of the contract we have contract administration that means uh we will uh make uh interim payment valuation to the contractors whether it's on monthly basis or on a stage payment basis we also work out the variations that are ordered uh during the cost of the work for the purpose of uh cost control we want to make sure that the the project budget or the contract sum is not exceeded we also finalise the account after a contract is completed uh at the end of the project after word word  certified and of course but not the least you see in every contract invariably there will be uh some contractual dispute maybe uh certain specifications or certain contractual provisions are not uh adequately drafted and there will be uh such contract dispute arising and uh as the quantity surveyor for the job uh it is our duty to advice the architects the engineers you see what is the view you see on uh certain aspect regarding the contractor's claims there right in addition to those basic q s functions some other q s functions that we do for example just now you have seen on the side uh this cost information quarterly is a publication of cost information uh which uh we uh make every quarter and which is available for sale to the public in this publication you'll be able to find information like uh cost indices of uh tenders or building materials or labour cost so that the the general industry the construction industry can refer to it and use it as a reference guide you see to let them have a feel of uh the trend of prices whether tender prices are going up or going down or whether material prices are going up or down that's uh cost information quarterly is available for sale to the public and it is published every quarter okay the next thing we do we also provide uh insurance and compensation valuation for the commissioner of land uh this is for the purpose of uh the land acquisition act you know there is in singapore we have this uh land acquisition act if property is uh acquired by the government compensation is payable to the land owner at certain pre-determined prices at certain age whether it's nineteen seventy-three nineteen eighty-six we will be able to be we are able to provide uh advice to the commissioner of land who's the one acquiring the property what is the value of that property at certain point in time whether it's nineteen seventy-three or eighty-six or even at current market value for insurance uh valuation it is for the purpose of uh insuring a property uh for fire uh for against damage by fire so this is required before any property is let out to the public we'll also provide advice on capital grant projects that means uh this capital grant projects are basically uh ministry of education uh projects aided-school projects where the government provides ninety per cent of the funds to this uh aided mission uh since the money the bulk of the money comes from the government in building the aided uh schools the mission schools we definitely will have to have a say to help uh ministry of education uh how to
