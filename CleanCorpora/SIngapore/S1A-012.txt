""
""
kinda imagine you stranded in east coast
""
""
 word 
""
""
ya lah you know
""
""
'a' my sis is desperate to get out of teaching
""
""
ha
""
really
""
why
""
how long has she been there
""
""
but she's got six more years to go right
""
""
ya
""
""
how long has she been there
""
""
oh that's not
""
""
she's from
""
""
can't she like get someone else to buy her
""
""
people can buy ya go and from buy her out from you know like
cambridge that kind of thing quite easy to bring her out
""
""
ya ya so she's trying to write to straits times
""
""
but then that would mean being stuck in straits times for six
years right
""
""
uhm
""
""
 word 
""
""
i thought going to private company is like how many was
""
""
will will  word   word 
by  word 
""
""
but if she really wants to leave she should but she should
give herself a year or two to really decide you know
""
""
can she tahan a year or two
""
""
that or try another school
""
""
no but she was never cut out for teaching lah anyway
""
but she doesn't mind teaching you know it's all the
""
""
that's what all teachers say uh
""
""
ya ya
""
""
uhm  word  always complain only about admin
""
""
so now what do you complain about
""
""
students as well
""
""
so there's nothing much lah is there
""
""
why work for admin
""
""
so are you looking around as well
""
""
they're getting aiyah it's boring lah
""
you know i mean they're just  word 
""
so this year i got very boring boring boring boring
""
""
you're teaching first year is it this year
""
""
second year
""
one class is very good i mean they're very interested in everything
but in other classes like they can't be bothered you know
""
""
ha
""
""
like aiyah why are we here in the first place
""
""
you mean that bad uh
""
i thought your your students will be more motivated than the
students from rjc
""
""
not really you know
""
""
why would they
""
""
i think about fifty percent are not not not interested
""
just going through the motion
""
""
do they see beyond 'a' level
""
i mean what do they see beyond 'a' level
""
""
university which they can't get into
""
""
ya lah be realistic
""
""
they may be very good at  word 
""
""
'a' level is such a useless
""
""
place isn't it
""
""
ya unless you can make it to the u you know
""
""
even  word 
""
""
but then what about education for its own sake uh
""
""
not at 'a' level
""
""
why not
""
""
not when they cram everything in two years
""
""
uhm
""
""
and you study from seven thirty to five
""
""
what do you get out of it
""
""
ya
""
""
because and then you talk about anything they don't sound
""
they're not interested in anything you know i mean like
""
""
the only thing i ever enjoyed was gp
""
""
because i got something out of it
""
""
 word 
""
""
maybe now that i'm leaving uh  word  like
less harsh on
""
i know my perception on the students  word 
become less  word 
""
""
but i like i like my last my students last time you know the
two first two batches i had
""
you brought up anything and discussed they're very interested
""
you know what i mean 'cos it's something interesting
""
""
you mean you got to work extra hard to make them interested
now
""
""
ya but i'm so tired
""
""
ya i think it's it's got to do with the system
""
""
 word  also you know
""
""
i don't think the students would have changed that that much
""
""
no they're they're definitely different
""
""
ya
""
""
i mean they're different now in maybe you just  word
 and put in their marks
""
""
uhm
""
""
except
""
""
uhm because partly you see there there's commerce classes and
science classes and arts classes
""
usually in arts classes they are more talkative
""
science classes also the boys they don't care
""
anyway you just say anything and it'll be very funny they don't
mind
""
but for the uhm
""
""
commerce
""
""
for the commerce
""
""
it tells
""
you mean you are shy
""
""
ya actually uh
""
""
but mean lah
""
actually it's mean lah all my sins before stumble  word
 and then stare
""
""
ya you're paying for your sins ya ya
""
""
ya
""
""
so actually i won't be too bad as a gp teacher but i never
did that to my gp teacher
""
""
but you know actually ha
""
but actually ha i was i was
""
i was interested what i was always interested i didn't chit-chat
or  word  goody goody
""
""

""
""

more
""
i mean we never had that last time you see
""
""

""
""

they must stop
""
""
you know those who are pampered
""
""

""
""

""

""
""
uh
""
""
i don't remember my teacher ever smiling at us
