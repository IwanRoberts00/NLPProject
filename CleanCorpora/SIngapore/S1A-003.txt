i know that i'm going to thailand so i didn't want to shop
""
i wasn't shopping for the last three months or so two three months
""
""
so you just let it out in the big bang
""
""
but i didn't buy much because i was quite disappointed with
the clothes
""
i was thinking of buying accessories and but then i was quite
reluctant to part with one hundred dollars just for  word 
things like that
""
""
what's the in thing there
""
""
in thing
""
""
at the moment
""
""
in thing i'm not quite sure
""
what is in thing
""
""
i mean like the clothes what's what's in fashion lah
""
""
couldn't really identify any fashion
""
it's all the long sum
""
maybe that's the in thing now
""
i couldn't see cotton material
""
quite plain it's just blouse
""
""
and that's it
""
""
ya
""
""
but i still think that it's it's still nicer than what we are
having here in singapore you know at the metro stores where they're having
those back to sixties kind of clothes
""
""
oh a line type is it
""
""
ya awful right oh you like it oh oh oh
""

shopping than i would have if if had it gone elsewhere
""
""

few shops which made it even worse you know
""
""

""
""

""
 laughs 
""
""
of course most of the things were like out of this world but
they were really heavenly you know the clothes were so beautifully cut the
the material was so nice but you know most of the people that you see there
are are quite with their nose stuck in the air indonesian women you you see
them you know with all their their their all the clothes piled over their
their hands
""
""
where is it this designer clothes
""
""
""
""
oh
""
""
ya
""
""
did you buy anything
""
""
just a belt for ninety nine dollars luciano soprani and when
i brought it back siew teng and and dr teo was saying that it wasn't worth
the money
""
""
who's dr teo
""
""
annie teo
""
""
oh i see
""
""
you know it had the luciano soprada logo in gold you know
""
""
oh dear right in front
""
""
rectangle all over the place all over the belt all along the
belt and the one thing about it was this gold crest would fall off and i had
to go and buy the super glue from from the co-op to stick it back you know so
were coming off already i didn't i didn't notice it you know because what
happen was was annie teo was looking oh brand name then she just tapped at it
and it fell off then i looked at her i said ooh then she said not my fault
not my fault ya i think it was about ten dollars worth and it got about six
crests on it
""
""
uh
""

quite interesting there were other things also of course but
not my size i think it would have been worth to look at it
""
""
is it

""
ya quite cheap
""
""
quite varied
""
""
i mean even though they were they were selling things for
forty percent to seventy percent it was still too out of out of like what
""
""
above five hundred
""
""
no i mean like blouses two hundred and fifty dollars for
just a blouse
""
""
it's terrible
""
""
i mean you won't want to pay two hundred and fifty for one
blouse
""
""
in the normal way
""
""
unless it's silk then unless it's silk then then you could
think about it
""
""
one suit or one haven't got anything that's above two
hundred yet
""
""

""
""
mhm
