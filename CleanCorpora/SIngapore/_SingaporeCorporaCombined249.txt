may it please you my lord i appear together with my learned colleague mister loh chai chong for the plaintiffs and my learned friend mister isaac nathan together with mister brown appear for the defendants my lord my lord we are grateful for your lordship for having given us granted us the indulgence to start this case a little late primarily because we wanted to get some primary documents from the police officer concerned now he has arrived and he has given part of the documents but he hasn't got a complete list so he's trying to locate the other part now but in any event for present purposes i think i'll put him in the witness-box at the appropriate stage and introduce his evidence and then perhaps later on he can come back and let us have the remaining documents my lord my lord the issues in this case are fairly straightforward whether of fact or of the law the plaintiffs' claim is really for the value of certain caterpillar spare parts that were stolen by a conspiracy of two of their employees and two other persons from the outside the conspirators finally sold all the stolen goods that will be our case to the defendants and the defendants themselves and that will appear from the various documents in the bundle or documents my lord sold to unknown third parties some of those parts which were stolen the last instalment which was stolen was recovered by the police who were alerted by the plaintiffs and they laid a trap and caught the culprits red-handed and that last instalment valued at about one hundred and sixty thousand dollars was recovered by the police and returned to the plaintiffs it will be the evidence of the plaintiffs my lord that the total value of the lost articles is approximately five hundred thousand singapore dollars and we will lead evidence as to how we arrived at that figure and alternatively damages so the issues are fairly short and they are as follow my lord firstly in purchasing the stolen articles from the conspirators and subsequently disposing of them if the defendants converted those goods that's the first issue in law were the goods converted by the defendants if so what were the value of those goods now going through my learned friend's bundle of authorities last night my lord we noticed that they are going to run a defence of purchase-in-the-market goods now we have ourselves gone to the point and my learned colleague mister loh chai chong has done some work and he would like to make his submissions on the law on that point my lord with your lordship's permission now if i may at this stage just introduce the bundle of documents the first one is the bundle of pleadings my lord which consist of the statement of claim and the defence has your lordship got it  plaintiffs' bundle of documents volume one  no my lord it's on the pleadings my lord bundle of documents lodged pursuant to order thirty-four rule three point six that's the one yes that consists of the statement of claim which is in very short form and the defence my lord which is also in relatively short form before i deal with the statement of claim my lord i'll deal with i'll introduce the other bundle of documents as well we have two plaintiffs' bundle of documents in two volumes volume one and volume two  volume two is described as supplementary bundle  that's right my lord bundle of documents volume two now my learned friend has got two documents defendants' bundle of documents volume one and volume two now quite a few of the important documents are repeated in both bundles in other words plaintiffs' bundle as well as the defendants' bundle my lord and at some stage both my learned friend and myself we'll get together for the purposes of agreeing so that we can have one common bundle as an agreed bundle for the time being my lord he says that he wants to preserve his position as to the relevance of some of the documents in my bundle anyway now the plaintiffs' volume two supplementary bundle is not agreed my lord my learned friend says that he's going to object to it depending on the use that i'm going to put that document to that's right isn't it  that's the computer thing i refer to my lord  that's right so we won't be marking these bundles at this stage my lord thank you very much so going back to the bundle of pleadings your lordship sees in paragraph two it's been asserted that the plaintiffs were the owners and entitled to possession of the caterpillar spare parts to the value of five hundred thousand dollars and that from the period january nineteen eight-three to september nineteen eighty-three at fourteen tractor road singapore the said caterpillar spare parts and other spare parts to the value of five hundred thousand dollars were stolen from the plaintiffs' warehouse by mohamed taz khan ramachandra ng kin sai and madam liau pau all the said stolen caterpillar spare parts of the said value of five hundred thousand dollars were old and delivered by the above-named mohamed taz khan ramachandra ng kin sai and liau pau min to the defendants during the said period from january nineteen eighty-three to september nineteen eighty-three the defendants then being in possession of the said stolen caterpillar spare parts have sold pledged delivered and/or otherwise dealt with or disposed of the said caterpillar spare parts to a person or persons unknown without the plaintiffs' consent express or implied whereby the plaintiffs suffered loss and damages and they claim five hundred thousand dollars my lord my lord the defence is interesting paragraph one the defendants deny receiving the said stolen caterpillar spare parts they do not admit what's alleged in paragraphs two and thirty of the statement of claim and in paragraph three they want to say as follows at all material times the defendants' purchased they say in the ordinary course of business certain caterpillar spare parts from foreign companies situated in the united states of america europe and japan and the local spare parts dealer namely uniborn enterprise company then having its registered office at number thirty-five kallang pudding road etcetera singapore the defendants bought the aforesaid spare parts in good faith and without notice of any defects or want of title on the part of uniborn enterprise company and paid a reasonable market price for the said goods now we asked for further and better particulars my lord of these allegations and we have them my lord in a separate document my lord before i deal with the particulars further and better particulars can i ask your lordship to have a look at page forty-five on the volume one of the plaintiffs' bundle of documents my lord forty-four it's a copy of our letter of second october nineteen eighty-six addressed to my learned friend's firm in which we say we refer to your client's defence filed and served on the plaintiffs of thirteenth august having examined the defence we are satisfied that our clients the plaintiffs in the above suit are entitled to the following further and better particulars of the defence of the suit under paragraph three on the allegation made by your clients that at all material times the defendants purchased in the ordinary course of business certain caterpillar parts etcetera kindly give full particulars of the alleged purchase of the caterpillar spare parts from such foreign companies and local spare part dealers especially uniborn enterprise company as follows and there we set it out my lord paragraph one paragraph two please state from whom in particular these alleged purchases were so made and whether they were oral or written and if written identifying the document or all documents in which these alleged purchases were in point three please state whether these alleged purchases were paid for and if so paid for whether in cash by cheques or any other form of payment and four please state to which person or particular persons in such company or companies such payments were so made the answer to that letter my lord appears on the next page page forty-six it says we are instructed that our clients are long established as dealers of spare parts and have been purchasing spare parts over a long period of time from companies situated in the united states of america europe and japan the identities of suppliers of these parts we are instructed cannot be disclosed at this stage as it may be prejudicial to our clients our clients consider this information as confidential and we therefore regret that our clients cannot accede to your clients request we then made applications of court and obtained necessary orders my lord and the next stage in these proceedings appears on page fifty of that bundle it's our letter of the sixth of march eighty-seven to my learned friend's firm we refer to the further and better particulars of the defence dated thirteenth august nineteen eighty-six filed and served by you pursuant to the order of court dated fifth january eighty-seven and to the answers given to request one two three and four thereof which our clients feel are inadequate as follows in respect of items a to f in the defendants answer to request number one the defendants have not disclosed the type of caterpillar spare parts giving the part numbers and amounts in respect of each of such parts allegedly sold to the defendants in respect of defendants' answer to request number two therein the defendants have not given the name of the person from whom the defendants had made these alleged purchases it is clear from the request that the plaintiffs want the name of the person from whom the alleged purchases were made as it is very clear from the order made by the honourable chief justice on the fifth of january nineteen eighty-seven that all the requests in the further and better particulars relate to uniborn enterprise company in respect of the defendants' answer to request number three the defendants have failed to answer whether the cheques were cash bearer or crossed cheques in respect of the defendants' answer to request number four the defendants have failed to answer to which person or particular persons uniborn enterprise company such payments were so made and we asked for those further particulars and what appears my lord in that document that i handed over a few minutes ago are the further particulars that were submitted and this is what they say the answer under paragraph one my lord appears on page two the caterpillar spare parts bought by the defendants were bought in lots without identification of part numbers and amounts of each of the parts as the same were mixed with the existing and newly purchased parts from various overseas suppliers the identity of these parts cannot be obtained by the defendants under paragraph two the answer is the defendants made the purchases from a person by the name of albert and who claimed to be the boss of uniborn enterprise under paragraph three my lord the answer is to the best of the defendants' knowledge the following purchases were made by the defendants in the manner provided hereunder and they give particulars of the cheques that were allegedly issued by the defendants to albert it will appear later is mister ng kin sai of the conspirators my lord the other relevant documents that i would like to refer your lordship to in the bundle of documents are as follows my lord i think i'll start off with my learned friend's bundle and that's volume two of the defendants' bundle of documents my lord the very first letter on page eight volume one my lord defendants' bundle of documents page eight my lord it's a letter of fourteenth november nineteen eighty-three written by my learned friend's office to affirm to the officer-in-charge jurong police station in which they say my lord that we understand that your officers have arrested one mister lim chee teck i believe he's one of my learned friend's witnesses under section four hundred and eleven chapter one hundred and three for the purchase of certain spare parts and have released him on a bond pending further investigations
