""
doctor can i show you three medical reports here written by you
""
your honour may that be admitted and marked your honour
""
his three medical reports on the bundle of page one two and three
""
""
page two
""
ya
""
yhe three medical report
""
""
all three marked as page three
""
all three by the same doctor sir
""
""
all of them page two
""
all right
""
""
may i refer you to the first report which is the one dated
eighteen of may
""
no sorry twenty-seventh of july nineteen eighty-one
""
twenty-seventh of july nineteen eighty-one that is page two
""
can you read the statement read your report to the court
""
""
this patient was admitted on the twenty-seventh april nineteen
eighty-one following a road traffic accident
""
special x rays did not show hemorrhage inside the brain but he was
thought to have suffered a bruising of the brain
""
the medical term for that is contusion
""
since then he has been followed up as an outpatient
""
a final assessment can only be made after a year
""
""
i see
""
so you confirm doctor that you examined this patient and you found
that there is a bruising on his brain
""
is that correct
""
""
that is correct my lord
""
""
now how severe was this injury
""
""
it was sufficient to cause changes on the c t scan which were
of a temporary nature
""
but not sufficient to cause bleeding inside the brain my lord
""
""
now may i refer you to the second report which you made on the
eighteenth of may eighty-two
""
you mention here that he was found to have some problem of
co-ordination
""
now what type of problem would you classify that as
""
""
i don't quite understand the question
""
""
i mean what type of
""
he had some problem of co-ordination
""
how severe and what characteristic would these problems of
co-ordination would be
""
""
he would have difficulty in performing a number of sequential
actions that is moving in an ordered sequence learnt movement
""
my lord the technical word for this is dyspraxia d y s p r a x i a
which means
""
""
now in this report you also mentioned that the c t scan did
not show any blood clot inside the skull
""
now this was done in nineteen eighty-two
""
""
no
""
""
no eighty
""
""
no the c t scan done on at the time of admission in april
nineteen eighty-one
""
""
eighty-one
""
ya that is right
""
""
i refer to that c t scan
""
""
but is it possible that at the time of accident there is a
contusion of the brain
""
i mean there is a blood clot
""
""
there was at the time of accident a contusion of the brain
seen on the c t scan not a blood clot
""
i want to distinguish between a contusion and a hemorrhage
""
""
just to reconfirm that i got what you have said
""
at the time of the accident you examined him and there was a
contusion in the brain
""
""
i examined the c t scan my lord
""
""
ya that is right
""
""
that showed the contusion
""
""
correct
""
that is all
""
""
the patient had symptoms of a contusion
""
""
how long will this contusion last
""
i mean does it stay on forever
""
""
the appearance my lord on the x-ray on the c t scan would be
obvious for a week few weeks or few months
""
just like a bruise it would disappear but the effects on the brain
may last for a considerably longer period
""
""
now i refer you to the last report which is sixth of september
eighty-three
""
in paragraph two you have reported that you have examined him on
the seventh of august nineteen eighty-three and that he was found to have
in-co-ordination of the right side of his body
""
now can you tell the court more about what in-co-ordination that
you found
""
""
we test for in-co-ordination my lord in a very standard way
""
we ask a person to touch your finger and touch his nose and move up
and down or to do a series of concerted actions like imitating playing the
piano or picking up objects
""
and by observing him do this we can notice any problems with
movement
""
""
in your opinion doctor do you know whether such injury would
be permanent
""
the in-co-ordination
""
""
it was present my lord for more than two years after the
accident
""
and i would therefore assume that it would permanent
""
""
from this injury to his brain doctor would you say that there
would be any side effect like for instance loss of memory headaches relapses
""
""
he could have mental problems but by his own testimony my
lord he did not complain of headaches and said he was otherwise normal
""
this is on my examination in august eighty-three
""
""
i see
""
you also mentioned in the last paragraph that because of his
impairment he will be unable to do his job as a welder
""
is that correct
""
""
that is correct my lord
""
it's in my report
""
""
i have no more further questions sir
""
""
doctor baratham when he was first admitted to the hospital on
the twenty-seventh of april nineteen eighty-one the x-ray showed a mere
contusion
""
is that not right or is that not right
""
""
the brain scans show the contusion my lord
""
i don't know about mere or it showed a bruising on the surface of
the brain
""
""
oh i see
""
so and he was not hospitalised
""
was he discharged immediately on the same day
""
""
no i am certain my lord he was hospitalised
""
""
for how long
""
""
i do not have a record of that not available
""
""
sir with your leave
""
sir my apologies to the court
""
i have not submitted the medical certificate
""
may i sir
""
""
sorry sir
""
""
authorised by doctor baratham sir
""
""
i am obliged sir
""
sir may that be admitted since they've agreed
""
""
yes
""
""
i am obliged sir
""
""
he was according to the medical cert he was discharged on the
seventh of may nineteen eighty-one
""
""
yes
""
""
now what were your observations while he was warded doctor
""
i mean was there any in co-ordination in this hand
""
or what was he suffering from while he was warded
""
or is it just a brain contusion
""
""
my lord i do not recall what my observations were when he was
warded because i would have been in charge of a very large number of cases
""
and my own observations for each individual case would not have
been made
""
""
my lord i would have supervised his treatment rather than be
in charge of his day-to-day treatment
""
""
doctor your medical report is brief
""
it merely states that he had a bruising of the brain and nothing
else
""
""
that is correct
""
""
then on the next page that is i mean your second medical
report on the eighteenth of may nineteen eighty-two
""
that's at page two of the plaintiff's bundle of documents
""
and your second medical report doctor you again merely refer to
the original x ray taken on the twenty-seventh of april nineteen eighty-one
""
so there was no further examination as such
""
""
there was no further x ray examination my lord
""
no correct
""
""
and this report merely states that he was last seen as an
outpatient on ninth september eighty-one when he had some problems of
co-ordination
""
he was not seen by you is that not doctor
""
he was seen by some other doctor on that date as an outpatient
""
""
yes he may not have been seen by me when i
""
""
so you wouldn't be able to assist this court as to what his
problems of co-ordination were on that date
""
""
not on this date no my lord
""
""
now on your third report doctor
""
on your third report you say he was reassessed for the purpose of
this report on seventeenth august eighty-three
""
at that time he was found to have in-co-ordination of the right
side of his body
""
does this refer to your first paragraph which says this man was
admitted to our unit on april nineteen eighty-one
""
does this report refer to the earlier findings of in-
co-ordination rather than on that date
""
""
it refers to my own assessment of him in august eighty-three
""
the in-co-ordination refers to the situation in august nineteen
eighty-three
""
my lord i alter that to at the time at the time
""
the second sentence in paragraph two should read at the time
""
it's at that time
""
i think this is a typographical error or a dictation error or it
should be at the time
""
""
at the time of this report on the time of this examination on
the seventeenth august nineteen eighty-three
""
my lord i am sorry for the ambiguity
""
this is the third report my lord
""
""
see doctor baratham you seem to have in your report accepted
this man's word rather than gone on your own observation because your
paragraph there
""
it says prior to this accident this man was a welder
""
he was tested by the foreman of his firm and his co-ordination was
found to be inadequate for a job of a welder
""
this is what he seems to have told you
""
this is not something you found out from the foreman of his firm
""
""
my lord i was not in communication with the foreman of the
firm
""
he told me this
""
""
he told you this
""
""
but his in-co-ordination was something i tested for and
observed myself
""
i did not my lord feel competent to decide whether his in-
co-ordination made it impossible for him to be a welder
""
i thought that was better left to his foreman
""
""
so you were not
""
""
i couldn't tell this my lord
""
i could tell his in-co-ordination
""
i couldn't say whether he could do a job as a welder
""
i am unfamiliar with welding
""
""
so that is exactly the point doctor
""
that you are unable to say whether he can work as a welder or not
""
""
i am unable to say this
""
it is impossible for me to decide that my lord
""
""
next you say in your report that he only had a moderate head
injury
""
what do you mean by that
""
""
that is correct my lord
""
we classify head injuries into mild concussions moderate injuries
""
where we have some clear cut evidence of permanent brain damage
and severe head injuries when the brain damage and severe head injuries is
such that the person can be totally incapacitated
