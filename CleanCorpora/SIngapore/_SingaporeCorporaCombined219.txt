okay the learning point of this exercise is this first you must have be creative enough or be imaginative enough to locate where the pages are then you use your logic to work out the total answer the logic ha but you are not creative enough or you are not imaginative enough to locate where the pages are all your logic will go to nought will go to waste you think about that that's why sometime you go and see your boss your boss scold you aye you're not imaginative enough lah always give this sort of answer not imaginative imagination is very important as what einstein says imagination is more important than knowledge einstein was reading he was one day daydreaming riding on a beam of light shooting towards the distant star but to his great surprise he did not arrive at a distant star he arrived at our local front our front here say aye what what has what has happened so he used his logic to explain it should actually mark a curve instead of going straight in another words uh light is does not necessarily tra travel on a straight line it's curve the universe is curve so he kept word to accumulate when he look at the curve so how did he arrive firstly he used his imagination his creative word  thinking after then he use his logic to explain so coming back to coming back to our problem which is more important creative thinking or logic thinking creative thinking or logical creative thinking if you look at it you and i we all graduates as a graduate we're paid that extra premium to solve logical problem or creative problem creative problem logical problem the clerk can do no need you what for employ you if you don't you see logic problem is application of set principles set set rules lah i give you ten dollar you must give four dollar i mean it's all very standard stuff okay if you your your car cannot park here fine ten dollars just fine ten dollars straight away logical it's that logical applying set principles but you and i are paid premiums to do creative solving to do creative problem solving if my problem is very logical no need to employ you lah basic task you are you are employed for the job to think think creatively now what sort of problems are difficult to solve creative problems or logical problems creative problems why firstly because of greater degree of uncertainty number two you must create your own answer the answers are not off the shelf number three it takes longer time to solve because there is uh no set procedure so these are three reasons why creative problems are harder to solve than logical problem what's the difference between logic problem and creative problem logical problems you use logic you use what what you call convergent thinking you also uh yah and one answer alright and lastly uh uh and there are four also don't know what i'm talking about let me to check there are three only let me get it facts right sometimes i forget it alright okay basically uh right one use convergence one use logic one answer convergent thinking vertical thinking if you have to use imagination then answer divergent in other words okay can i leave so much so for practical problem let us go into uh uh creative principle ha eight major principles here's try word  the first thing in creative principle is uh testing assumptions testing assumptions you must always test assumptions in fact when you talk about creativity uh willing to stick till there i can hear all the right answer just listen is good enough alright okay okay uh let me tell you about about creativity in terms of uh in terms of something which is very practical i think when we talk about creativity actually we're talking about how can we shape our paradigm now paradigm subserves assumptions ways of doing things we all have paradigm why is it that we're not creative in large in part because we have certain mind type certain way of doing thing and this can be very dangerous paradigm set out to do on people's graphs word  or word word you it prevent us from seeing things and that's pooh pooh word status let me give you an example in 1968 the swiss control seventy per cent of the watch industry they got seventy per cent market share that's really markets of you know in 1978 they only control ten per cent market share that is 'kosong' almost 'kosong' this is what i call the shift in paradigm of course from seventy per cent to ten per cent what happens what has what has happen in 1968 one of the swiss engineer new word  chepard word invented the quartz watch when he invented the quartz he showed it to all the swiss designers but the swiss designer the swiss watch maker of of of his day have a good look at the quartz watch and they'll say this cannot be a watch this is no tread how can this ever be a watch if you have no main spring no gear no bearing how can it ever be a watch ai yah nothing one nah this one just ignore it so the poor engineer uh but they allow the poor engineer to exhibit his uh quartz watch in the international uh watch show seiko and texas instrument were there 1968 both took a good look at the quartz watch and the rest is all history the swiss have to sack fifty thousand of their sixty-five thousand workers in the watch-making industry that's catastrophe because switzerland is like singapore very small they got three point five million people and we got about about slightly more to be sack twenty thousand of the people sack within ten years that is uh that is certainty very hard to imagine but what has happen this is because the swiss watch-maker were caught in their own paradigm no main spring no gear no bearings how can this ever be a watch forget it this cannot be a watch and this prove catastrophic for them let me tell you another story of our time this is pertaining to the cd player you know the compact disc player actually it was uh sony that invented the cd player back in the seventies early seventies but after deferring for a couple of years they gave it up because they just put it on the shelf but it so happen that philips was also developing it but philips thought that sony got head start maybe we should just go and talk to sony they may tell a thing or two so uh philips brought their cd player along and philip show sony their cd player when when the sony people saw philips' cd player they nearly drop dead because philips produced the cd player of what we know of today the four and the half inch one is it very small one do you know why the sony people nearly drop dead all the while they were thinking of twelve-inch cd player you see ah when you invent a twelve-inch cd player see if i could word  firstly if you want to make it portable carry around okay besides being bulky or what let say you you manage to make it portable the thing is this lah a twelve-inch cd player can last eight hours of playing time now which battery can last eight hour you have problem number one problem number two you know how much a record player cost if it is twelve-inch that runs for eight hours one hour already cost you thirty buck eight hours my goodness almost three hundred buck who could afford a piece that cost three hundred buck so no wonder they put it on the shelf you see the sony people were caught in the paradigm of the of what of the twelve-inch record player and because when they got stuck they couldn't move at all they got stuck and they could not move at all once you get the danger of paradigm getting caught you know getting caught i'll like to talk about mcdonalds in singapore when robert kwan wanted to introduce the mcdonalds in singapore it was especially a paradigm shift too it was a relevant shift he see a lot obstacles the obstacle is firstly he's bringing in the concept of fast-food no need fast-food in singapore a hawker centre our hawker centre equally fast you sit down there for five minutes the fellow give you right how can i talk about fast food number two singaporeans don't eat beef right because many of us are buddhist right hamburger also got beef number three there was already a a fast-food centre here a & w and a & w therefore they were struggling right they were not doing business in fact i mean they were about to you know at the verge of  word  they were struggling but here again a paradigm shift robert kwan in mcdonalds prove them all wrong okay so it's very dangerous if we get stuck to a paradigm ha we need to to break away from this from this paradigm from this usual way of thinking from this concept i think however a little bit crazy ha okay first step paradigm breakage is that we must always try to test our assumptions testing assumptions is very critical let me tell you a story two boys went to a forest they met a bear the bear started to give chase of the two boys half-way through through the running uh the two boys one of the boys stopped he tried to take out from his back-pack his reebok running shoes and started to put it on the other boy turn around and you crazy fellow what for you put on your reebok running shoes you'll never run faster than a bear the other boy putting on his shoe turn around and say yes it is true i'll never run faster than a bear but i only have to run faster than you that's what i mean by testing assumptions anyway you can go wrong word  first assumption was of course run faster than a bear second assumption is to run faster than the boy than the bear will catch the boy won't catch you but that doesn't mean that you all should go back and uh don't have to work very hard just work better than your other colleagues okay the second thing that we need to do is uh in fact testing assumptions is uh we have to be pos we we have to adopt a positive attitude okay you have to try to obtain a you can get ready uh to okay uh i want you to give me as many comments as possible alright i give you uh two minutes to think about my new wheel barrow can see my wheel barrow ha can see my beautiful wheel barrow forget about the spelling a bit wrong don't worry i'm damn hopeless on spelling b a r r o w okay i can never get the spelling word  okay i'll write uh what uh give me as many comments you can think of i'll be going round to collect comment so everybody must come up with one ah okay we'll start with the other row and save this row from all embarrassment word  okay we'll start from the first row okay first comment any comment you can repeat what other people had said nevermind  comments  now look carefully if i were to look carefully at all your comments actually uh this is what you want i told you this a design of a new wheel barrow ha i did say this is new wheel barrow design okay doesn't matter lah okay lah i i okay lah i don't know what i say okay nevermind  ah alright okay if i were to look carefully at all your comments ah actually this is what you want right observe carefully am i not right this is what you want? correct or not? so what you want is a what? a conventional old wheel barrow what you want is a conventional old wheel barrow but when you see a new design of wheel barrow you 'ng kum guan' you must go back to the original
