mrs chua rang this morning
""
she's wondering whether she's invited to tonight's dinner and uhm i
told her that she was
""
mrs lim had taken for granted that she was going and there was no
need to send a special invitation to her
""
she said anyway she just came back from uh the rockies
""
and she says that the weather there is warm not cool as we as we
thought it would be
""
and surprisingly she said the rocky the  word 
where she stayed for two days was also warm
""
""
uhm
""
""
so
""
""
how long was she there in the canada
""
""
fifteen days fifteen days with her two daughters and
son-in-law one son-in-law
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and she said that uhm she enjoyed it very much
""
she says the scenery is one of the best and she she also mentioned
that she went up to the uh summer fraser university and the view from there
is excellent
""
""
uhm
""
""
she says the architecture too is good but she doesn't think
that that building deserves first prize in the uhm something like
architectural uh competi competition
""
""
is it
""
when did they get first prize
""
i didn't know
""
""
it seems there was some competition
""
""
uhm
""
""
of architectural designs and summer fraser university topped
""
""
oh that's that's very good what
""
""
uhm
""
""
huh
""
""
uhm
""
""
cos our children love that place very much huh
""
since they've been there for about four years
""
""
she says the building is nice but not that wonderful
""
but the view is from there is excellent
""
""
but i think the  word  building is unusual
""
""
you know
""
""
because all these buildings are connected to one another and
there's no exposure to the rain and the sun
""
i think that was what  word  told us last time
wasn't it
""
""
ya it seems ya ya
""
""
uhm
""
""
eh actually we should walk round the buildings
""
we have not walked
""
we have not even been into the main uh building itself
""
""
oh we managed to see quite a lot during the convocation
""
sam's convocation
""
""
ya that ya that's the
""
""
uhm
""
""
that's the open space itself but not the the halls and the
enclosed areas
""
""
uhm we did go in
""
a short while i remember
""
i think that was a few years back
""
remember or not
""
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm
""
""
uhm
""
then we went to ya we went inside the building itself
""
""
uhm and then uh my friend esther she also just came back from
i think melbourne
""
she went to attend her son's convocation in melbourne
""
""
how many people will be there tonight
""
""
uh probably twelve probably twelve
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
uhm that would include the my ex-colleagues
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and the three people i went holidaying with recently
""
gracie uh cel and hock eng
""
""
and where will it be tonight  word 
""
""
uh singapore's swimming club
""
""
hor
""
hope won't end too late tonight
""
""
no i don't think so
""
anyway you'll be having your meeting
""
""
uhm
""
""
what time will your meeting end
""
""
i think uh we should end by nine-thirty not uh
""
the latest should be ten but i don't think it will stretch as long
as ten o'clock
""
would it
""
""
uhm
""
""
so far we had the meetings ending only about nine thirty
""
""
oh ya ya
""
by the end uh sam and karen won't be going with you because they
think that uh it's a little inconvenient for victor uh vin not victor vincent
to you know to keep them company till about ten
""
and also vincent would be actually having dinner at her uhm's his
uhm's
""
""
uhm
""
""
place
""
""
uhm
""
""
so they they rang just now to ask me whether i could ask
victor to allow them to use his computer
""
""
uhm uhm
""
have you asked victor already
""
""
not yet
""
i only spoke to kathleen but then the we we had to cut short our
conversation because she had an incoming call at her office you know so
""
""
so he wants to do it tomorrow  word 
""
""
no tonight tonight tonight
""
i mean if he's unable to finish he says he'll carry on tomorrow
night
""
""
ya it's more convenient because uh after all they're only a
few doors away from here
""
""
ya
""
""
just a short distance
""
but vincent's place is too far
""
it's bishan and i think uh i don't think it'll be very convenient
for them to go a few times
""
""
ya
""
and also lucy rang up to ask me whether i would be able to fry
some bee hoon for tomorrow night's function
""
""
not tomorrow
""
saturday
""
""
oh saturday saturday
""
that's right
""
""
ya
""
""
so i told her that hemelia is very new at cooking and she may
or may not be able to do a good job out of out of it
""
""
uhm
""
""
so that's for the time being
""
uh i told her that i would just say 'yes' and if i can think of
another dish i'll do that dish
""
""
but bee hoon would be very good  word  if
she can fry bee hoon
""
""
no she's got michelle to do some uh sambal sambal prawns i
think
""
and others are doing the chicken and the batch  word
 and some desserts
""
i think i'll prepare some desserts for them also
""
""
hemelia can cook the fish ball or the meat ball
""
""
uh meat ball ya
""
""
can ask her do that
""
she's quite good at it
""
""
anyway they want a staple
""
bee hoon is a staple
""
""
are we expected to be here on saturday night
""
""
well they ask if we would be like to be home
""
""
uhm
""
""
they want to include us in the dinner but
""
""
uhm
""
""
i don't know
""
""
i see
""
""
we'll go we'll have our swim in the afternoon and then we'll
see we we don't have to rush back for the occasion
""
but if we are home we'll join them
""
if not we will see what we what else
""
""
will it be for the regional fellowship group or the christian
education program
""
""
no no no no this is for the cep christian education group
""
""
uhm
""
""
and they are expecting around twelve people
""
""
i thought you told me about twenty people
""
""
no twenty are in the list of uh participants
""
""
uhm
""
""
but twelve will be coming for tonight's uh to saturday's
function
""
""
uhm uhm
""
so we have our swim first in the afternoon right
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and then let us take our time coming back
""
will we have dinner first
""
""
ya
""
""
or shall we join them for dinner
""
""
uh it's up to us it's up to us
""
""
then we should
""
""
uhm
""
""
but if we join them for dinner that means we have to come
back at a certain time
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
""
""
huh
""
whereas if we just stay on in the club for a few hours and we can
come after they finish their dinner
""
""
uhm ya
""
""
huh
""
""
that's right
""
""
and we can join them for the meeting
""
right
""
""
what meeting are they having
""
""
i thought they are having a meeting aren't they
""
""
is it
""
i don't know
""
i thought it was just some uh
""
""
just a get-together
""
""
get-together
""
""
i'm sure there will be a message uh
""
""
ya
""
""
sure somebody will be giving a short talk lah
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
""
""
perhaps vincent will be giving a short talk
""
""
uhm i don't know
""
you see he didn't mention that
""
""
uhm
""
so alex will be  word 
""
""
how's your alex
""
""
alex will be in the cep  word 
""
""
alex in a different group altogether
""
""
uhm ya
""
""
what's uh your program for sunday uh
""
uh i heard from mama that uhm nai kiaw's father has just undergone
an operation
""
""
uhm
""
""
uhm i'm not sure what the operation is and her mother is
""
""
when was that
""
""
uhm just a three days back i think and if
""
""
which hospital was that
""
""
gh
""
""
uhm
""
""
well if we are not going anywhere in the afternoon on sunday
we might drop in just drop in and visit him lah
""
you want
""
""
won't be too rush is it
""
""
sunday afternoon lah or even before going out in the evening
""
see uh
""
and her mother it seems has is not feeling well too
""
she's due to go back to toronto on the ninth of may but now she's
got to uh either cancel her trip or postpone her trip
""
""
uhm
""
""
this speaker this tape recorder and speaker is very
interesting
""
small thing like that and it's
""
""
it's supposed to take uh take eh to catch your voice from a
long distance
""
""
is it
""
""
yeah
""
i think this is called a uni-  word  microphone
 word 
""
""
uhm this morning i was listening to the tape i bought from
malacca some years back cantigas
""
cantigas i think is portuguese music portuguese singing
""
portuguese uh singing is very lively
""
oh ya by the way uh loonie rang up last night
""
loonie i i'm not sure whether he rang from singapore or from
philippines
""
he didn't indicate that
""
but he rang
""
i don't i don't know why he rang also
""
""
ya i i don't know whether to bring up the matter to elders in
his unit uh tomorrow evening
""
""
uhm
""
""
i think it's not necessary huh
""
""
don't no need lah
""
doesn't doesn't uh really uh interest them
""
""
now aileen hu's uh the the dinner is on for tuesday
""
""
uhm uhm where will it be
""
""
i think it should be at the singapore
""
let me see
""
airlines club what do you call it
""
sia club
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
sia club ya
""
seems that anybody could go there eh for the dinner or for for the
meals
""
""
it's different for our club
""
""
uhm
""
""
our club is so exclusive
""
i i i don't know the fact that they have to charge visitors who
come in for just for a meal
""
""
well they've got their reason i suppose otherwise there'll be
all sorts of all all sorts of people coming in
""
""
ya but if members uh members sign them in it's okay what
""
i mean shouldn't shouldn't uh make it that difficult for members
to have a guest for dinner or for lunch
""
or of course lunch-time it's anybody can come in on work on
working days not on weekends nor public holidays but uhm working days they
allow that
""
""
uhm you see in chinese swimming club they have a separate
entrance going to the restaurant so people use just use that entrance and
come out exactly in the same way
""
""
uhm
""
""
whereas in our club uh you have entrance going to the
swimming pool as well as to the billiards room as well as to uh you know the
other facilities rooms
""
""
anyway i don't like the chinese swimming club 
""
it's so much like a little uh uh uh a mini-china
""
""
uhm
""
""
the colour is blue and the new uh pool with its building has
got such uh poor taste the archi architecture is such
""
""
it's chinese what that's
""
""
the architecture is so bad
""
""
i mean that's typical chinese what  word 
""
""
i i don't know i feel as thouh i'm in china when i see
 word  look at that building i'm in that in that ang in
that space there
""
""
ya uhm what we don't really appreciate is enclosed feeling
that we get when we go there whereas we
""
""
it's so different from our from the changi beach club
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
where you have the sea right in front of you and the breeze
""
""
uhm
