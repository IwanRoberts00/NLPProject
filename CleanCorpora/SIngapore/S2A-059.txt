""
""
let me open up an application and i'll explain parts of a
window
""
we've got a bit more hands-on later on
""
your note pad is a windows application
""
there's accessory in-built in your windows three one
""
okay let me go back to your page ten notes mouse pointer
""
okay what do you see
""
this is your mouse pointer
""
that is mouse pointer
""
but when you move your mouse pointer into the note pad window it
changes into a what you call a pin
""
that's when you click to change your insertion point from one
location to another
""
that's your insertion point
""
the insertion point is the point that which whatever you type in
your keyboard it will be reflected there okay
""
so if you go use your mouse pointer to click anywhere that you want
your your uh insertion point to go
""
okay let's go to another one control menu box
""
you see on the top left-hand corner of your note pad window this is
your control menu box
""
when you click once on it it display the menu
""
move size minimise maximise close switch tools
""
all these commands you could make do without using them here
""
you could make use of these commands by using the mouse and doing
it with the mouse rather than selecting the commands from your control menu
box
""
the only time when you think you need to use the control menu box
is when you want to exit from the application
""
okay later i'll teach you how to exit from note pad one of the
fastest ways it to double click on the control menu box
""
that's when you exit note pad okay
""
this is your control menu box
""
i'll teach you how to move size minimise maximise the window later
on
""
let's go to the third one title bar window title
""
this is your title bar okay the one that is labelled in blue colour
""
the active one is always in blue
""
programme manager is now running at the background
""
programme manager here this is the title bar for programme manager
""
this is the title bar for note pad
""
which ever one is whichever is the one that's active in the
foreground will be labelled blue
""
the other one will be transparent
""
but it's up to you to define your colour that you want at desktop
it's up to you
""
but default it's blue
""
okay this is your title this is your title bar with your window
title
""
so notepad defines this window as an application window for notepad
okay
""
menu bar this is your menu bar
""
you see file exit search help
""
this is common uhm uhm the best part of all the commands are common
between windows applications
""
you don't find just menu bar in the non windows application
""
okay you could only find this in any windows application
""
what happens is you could click on any of the words any part of
those words there to draw down the menu
""
for file you have one menu
""
edit you have another to uh draw down menu for search another one
and so on and so forth
""
okay this is your menu bar with your uh menu commands
""
what you do is you click on any of the words there to drag down the
menu bar click on anyone of them to select the commands
""
okay let's go to next page eleven scroll bars
""
can you here this is your scroll bar
""
this is your scroll bar
""
what happen is sometimes your document is so long the window cannot
take the whole data
""
i mean it's it's thing wordperfect whatever
""
so what happen is that you click on the up and down arrow to scroll
hope you can see here
""
then you click here then you go up and down the the page
""
or you could click anywhere here
""
okay to move down up and down
""
this is your scroll bar and you got a up and down scroll bar and a
left and right scroll bar
""
this is your left and right scroll bar
""
same light one to scroll left and right this one is to scroll up
and down
""
okay maximise and minimise button
""
you remember at the control menu box you have to maximise and
minimise
""
you don't have to use your commands here
""
you can use the two small little function uh i mean boxes here
which you could do
""
the up arrow is the maximise arrow maximise uh uh what you call the
maximise icon
""
this one is the small one the minimise function
""
so if you click on the out arrow notepad takes over the full screen
and you would no longer will see programme manager
""
okay it's something like running a dos application in full screen
""
and when you click on the maximise one it should go to the install
button
""
 question 
""
can you see
""
see that one
""
the maximise the maximise button is coverted into a restore button
right so when you click on that it restores you back to the size that you
have had before you put in your maximise button
""
okay and this downward arrow is the minimise button
""
you click on that notepad is minimised as application icon but
where is the icon
""
the icon is somewhere here
""
okay that's the notepad on the desktop
""
this is your notepad running as a minimised application icon double
click on that to get back in notepad
""
okay whatever size it was before you analysed it
""
you have any question so far
""
okay i can go on eh
""
window border
""
this is your window border
""
the double line window border and when you push your mouse pointer
to anywhere along the border your mouse pointer is changed to a double header
arrow
""
that is when you could resize your window
""
so if you drag and release drag and release this would have been
resized
""
if you drag and release at the corner you're resizing from both
sides
""
okay if you're doing for one side you're resizing it from one side
only
""
that's when you need to to resize it yourself
""
okay that's why the scroll bar is is there to to to uh let you see
the whichever path you  word  after the resizing 
word 
""
okay window corner window border we've touched that
""
selection cursor insertion point this one i have explained before
""
okay this is the point where once you see that blinking there
whatever you type whatever you put in on the keyboard it would be reflected
there
""
okay that's page eleven
""
any question on the terminology for windows parts of the window
""
chapter three we have lots of hands-on so uh once we go to chapter
three we have a few exercises to do
""
chapter three is a very very important chapter
""
once you get a hang of chapter three uh you know what windows is
all about
""
okay let's go to chapter three
""
uhm page thirteen you don't get to see all these things because
you're in a different environment
""
okay programme manager is central to the operation of windows
""
it starts automatically whenever you start windows
""
it continues to run as long as you're using windows
""
so programme manager is the one that i've that i've always stress
upon
""
programme manager
""
okay the programme manager that you see on your environment is a
full screen programme manager
""
so you never ever get to see the green desktop actually
""
okay later i'll demonstrate
""
if you resize your programme manager you should be able to see
parts of the three desktop here
""
when we push it to full screen because we need as much space as
possible for all the applications
""
okay uhm let's skip the two lines there let's go down to the last
paragraph
""
notice there are technical group icons at the bottom of your
programme manager
""
you've got accessories group a group servor  word
 and group applications group
""
all this you can't see it here because we are having the nusnet
environment
""
okay it's not important let's go to page fourteen
""
more definitions
""
okay let's go to page fourteen and uh once again i want to explain
something on the screen
""
group windows
""
okay group windows
""
group windows programme item icons
""
all these things are called group icons
""
what do you mean by group
""
group in the sense that uhm they collect more things
""
they are not application icons in the sense that when you double
click on this it doesn't run anything for you
""
what it does is that it opens up another windows with more icons
this side
""
so it's called a group icon
""
and with  word  this icon opens up to a group
window
""
for example word-processing this is your group window for
word-processing
""
so you double click on this control menu box
""
it shrink back to a group icon or you double click on languages
compilers
""
it opens up to a languages compilers group window showing you more
icon inside
""
okay what happen is inside the word-processing uh group window you
have more icons inside and these icons are application icons in the sense
that when you double click on them it does something for you
""
it runs the application already
""
so when you double click on wordperfect it runs wordperfect for
you
""
you double click on microsoft word five point five it runs that
application for as opposed to these icons here which when you double click it
shows you more icons that's all
""
okay so these are programme item icons these are group icons and
this one is a group window
""
get it this terminologies once you are used to them you don't have
to bother about them which is it's just very natural okay
""
and windows three point one has its limitation in the sense it can
take only up to two levels which means that programme manager is the group's
level and this is group level one
""
group level one opens up to group level two
""
and by the time you come to group level two you can't have a group
icon inside here already
""
maybe you can but uh what happens is that there is a limit
""
there is no such thing as putting a group icon into this another
one opens up to another group icon this icon opens up to another window
""
okay there comes to a time when you have to dump in programme item
icons in that window
""
you can't go on anymore
""
that's the limitation and that's why we have so many icons here so
many windows because nusnet has so many applications
""
and windows three point one up to uh only gives you up to only two
levels in the hierachy
""
so what happens is that you've got uhm a very uhm more than
complicated kind of  word 
""
okay i've touched on page fourteen
""
any problem on page fourteen
""
group windows group icons programme item icons
""
okay what happens is programme item icons just band in one
programme item icons are active icons
""
if you double click on them it it will run something for you
according to the definition you attach to that icon
""
okay group icon and group windows are just uh what group windows
are just window  word 
""
it's just a window  word 
""
it gives you more icons
""
inside your group icons where you have shrunk to this okay
""
i i'm not gonna touch accesories group games group and application
group because our nusnet environment doesn't  word 
""
what i what i can point out is accesories group accesories group
which you have it on here
""
okay in accesories group you have write paintbrush terminal
notepad reporter and so on
""
 word  explain briefly what are the functions
of each one
""
write is actually a very primitive word-processing application
""
paintbrush is also very primitive graphics application
""
terminal is for you when you want to uh put in a a modem or
whatever when you want to dial up to nusnet from from your place at home you
have to double click on terminal and  word  by 
word  and so on and so forth 
""
notepad as i have demonstrated just now is also a primitive
word-processor normally we use it for text editing recorder is a macro
recorder in the sense that it could uhm uhm record uhm all your actions for
you and you save it in with one with one one key uhm what you call it a a
combination key key notes you call it so when once you just or put in the key
notes you could run the whole series of uhm run functions that's what a
recorder is hard-file is your hard-file calender is your calender calcu is
the calculator clock clock tells you the time that is based on instant time
on your on your machine i could change between digital and analog one object
packager later i'll explain o l e character map media player sound recording
and voice sound record you need an extra sound card character map is for you
to install extra characters like uh greek or whatever character okay i'm not
going to touch on that maybe now i should explain something on uh o l e i
didn't touch on o l e could i have the lights on thank you very much
