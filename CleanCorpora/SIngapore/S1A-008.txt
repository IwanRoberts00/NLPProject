""
it gets red when activated

arrested uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
huh
""
really
""
""
he's saying but what's wrong uh

why
""
""
because they were nudists
""
""
because the the undercover cops went there
""
""
and they got molested and they got fed up
""
""
molested propositioned
""
""
but why did they go there to get molested and then and then
arrest people
""
""
after hour recreation and then they were not satisfied
""
""
they they can't arrest them if they were not molested
""
""
uhm uhm so they must like open themselves to
""
""
but it's okay what i mean unless there are rape cases
reported uh
""
were there
""
were there
""
""
not loud enough
""
""
rape cases
""
""
no right no no males got raped there right

""
""

""
""
uhm
""
""

""
""
why they claw on you
""
""
a story worth telling
""
""
ya what happened
""
""
ya okay
""
""
i told you before right
""
""
i don't remember
""
anyway
""
""
i was cycling there lah uh
""
""
which part
""
which part
""
tell
""
""
uh it's near the end of the cycling cycling track
""
uh the other end from here uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
i was cycling off the track you know
""
there's one part where the cycling track is quite quite far away
from the uh floor line
""
""
uhm because of the reclaimed land there lor
""
""
the last  word  the last drain
""
the last drain you know
""
there are several drains
""
uh the
""
""
uhm  word   word 
actually get
""
""
canal canal's going to the sea
""
""
uhm okay
""
""
the last drain before you reach the end
""
there's one path  word 
""
there you know cycling there it's evening time
""
i i don't know what was going on actually
""
""
uhm
""
""
just noticed a lot of males uh walking alone
""
""
uhm
""
""
you know
""
so i thought there could be some kind of illegal activity going
""
""
uhm
""
""
i had no idea what exactly uh
""
i was enjoying the place because it's nice ya nice bumpy areas
""
i like bumpy areas
""
""
uhm that's why he needs a
""
""
i like bumpy  word 
""
""
that's why he needs a that rocking woman
""
""
uhm ya
""
then there's one part where i came across two naked men
""
""
uhm
""
""
ya
""
probably they heard me coming along uh
""
so they were both standing up
""
one was looking very shy
""
the other man was overweight
""
looks like a typical towkay guy
""
doesn't look like a gay at all
""
towkay guy completely naked doing stretching exercises with a huge
tummy
""
""
so all you saw was
""
""
where where where where
""
where were they stretching exercises
""
""
wait wait wait
""
you actually saw his front nuh or or he was facing the sea and
""
""
i came from behind him so he was doing stretching exercises
""
""
where was he doing the stretching
""
""
the beach is it
""
""
they're both looking very self-conscious
""
huh
""
where oh where
""
""
on the beach itself
""
""
uh not that near the beach rather nearer the cycling track
""
""
uh oh ya the casuarina trees or
""
""
ya uh
""
""
uh so at least not totally unshielded or anything
""
""
but they were so near the that the crisscrossing tracks
inside lah
""
you know they're so near the tracks not discreet at all and uh
""
""
why must they be discreet
""
okay anyway
""
""
they were very self-conscious lah
""
obviously not real
""
""
maybe still looking for new khakis uh
""
""
not real exercising lah
""
just or he could be warming up but i doubt it lah
""
it looks more like you know very self-conscious and for the sake
of doing something else just do some stretching exercise
""
""
maybe just to pretend
""
""
to this huge  word  tummy and they
 word 
""
""
that's that's when you're very near them lah
""
if not horrible
""
""
i cycled past them lah while he was doing this stretching
exercise to the huge tummy and the huge erection
""
""
wah
""
""
and the right guy was trying to look away looking natural
""
""
uhm
""
""
a much smaller guy
""
""
when you said encounter
""
i thought there were something more to it like what happened to
you
""
""
i wanted to stay and watch but i thought it's not very
decorous
""
""
can watch what
""
new new paper has said there're some people stay there and watch
""
""
can uh
""
can bring video camera along uh
""
""
no lah
""
""
why not
""
a you want extra income right
""
""
they like to be
""
no lah i wouldn't be so mean
""
""
why so mean
""
some of these people are exhibitionists uh
""
""
unless they are actually what
""
""
i mean they stay so close to the track then then they allow
people to watch them
""
""
actually uh what are they doing
""
maybe this' their way of you know attracting new blood lah right
""
""
""
