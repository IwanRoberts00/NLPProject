hello hi ya oh hi how are you fine oh so what are you doing i was marking my papers oh my literature papers ah hah ya oh just took a break lah just now so have to go back to my work how many classes do you have to mark three aw this is not so bad ya  word  next week monday oh next week ya so uhm monday is okay because i i don't have any papers tuesday my paper start coming in ah hah then i don't get any till next monday you know so stupid the way they planned it so i have all my papers next mon the following monday and it is like five sets of literature and two sets of moral education ah hah so i i have so much to mark on that you know during that week terrible oh ya i am not looking forward to it sorry anyway this whole week you know i will be so free oh you know what i mean because i would have marked because the paper i am going to get on tuesday is not too difficult to mark who does the scheduling the head of department hod lah ah okay ya but i i don't know i see if i can't cope might  word tell her and then maybe second next term they can uhm do something about it lah ya well guess what i am looking at at the moment uh ashley yes he fell down on a couch uhm bas bask in the uh in the warmth of the house uh hah tell you this chap is something else he is so naughty uhm uhm why he refuses to take his medicine he is having fever uhm we brought him to dr lim on monday uhm uhm that well because of two reasons he slept the whole day on my mother's bed oh well he found a new place to sleep and then not only that in the evening when sandy was eating don't know what he did he went near sandy of course you know it irritated sandy and sandy snapped at him and he had a deep gnash-like thing in the nose oh so my parents had to bring him to dr lim uhm i find him better now when was there blood or anything ya there was oh he has recovered from his fever he's not eating as well though uhm uhm we are just hoping that he is going to become better because the doctor has also given him tablets which you know increases appetite uhm so when hopefully he is going to eat more and become and strong cat uhm he is sneezing at the moment and it's so funny you know he behaves just like a human being the way he looks at you really the way he jumps off the table and and you know he walks upstairs uhm and he sleeps on the bed uhm uhm i mean it is uh the and the people at spca came it seems they came yesterday and they wanted to see it uh ashley oh and my father said oh he is he's not feeling well and he is upstairs sleeping on the bed so the the officers said oh very lucky cat sleeping on the bed  word  he is jolly good that is all he want to check oh they want to see whether you are taking care of it ya oh and it is funny because they didn't check on on uhm sandy because pariah word cat what uh sandy sandy which one is sandy uh pat and daryl's dog oh i see they didn't check on him uh really they also got it from spca yes and they are checking on ashley oh because it is pedi pedigree is it patrich word pedigree cat yes and no i don't think they make uh you know i don't think they make a differentiation but i think it was i think it's something which they just like they take a hand random lah ya random check  word pick on you know uh they just want to check on on the new you know adopted uhm perhaps uh ya jolly good sleeping on the bed  word sleeping word  upstairs would you like to word on my wife's bed oh sleeping on bed oh very lucky cat oh not to worry we want to go word  aiyoh ya lah your cats are so lucky lah hah the animals who live in your house are just just so lucky they must have been they must have had very good lives that is all ya i was going to say they must have been good human no they couldn't have been good human beings cause then they wouldn't have been animals right no there is another theory that you cannot sort of uh you cannot sort of uh dig word what is there such a word as degress re regress uh ah regress from a human being to a animal you cannot uh no oh means you can come back as another human being ya but you will have a more difficult life to i see you cannot come back as an animal no you can't i have been telling my students cause we are doing religions right so i mean my understanding is if you you if you are mean in this lifetime you come back as a cockroach or something like that so i was telling them no no ya see i am telling them wrong things  word coming back as a cockroach but have a harder time as a cockroach oh aiyah that is so silly i mean i mean which cockroach has a good time which cockroach sleeps on a bed know what i mean oh ya i have heard there are some but not in that sense you word talk about it it is like why like everyone has like a set of like seven cards in life how is that your set of cards are different from the set of cards that someone in calcutta has who sleeps on the road uhm uhm you know what i mean it is like i think some things cannot be explained i mean i wouldn't want to try to explain it i mean i i don't think that in other words i mean if there is a life before it is possible it may not be possible but i think word it's just a theory but it is quite likely you know that there should be cleared  word live word before if that explains why you know our lord now no i don't think so lah ya there it it explains what they cannot change like for example you know our family why are we born into certain family things like that ya uhm social economic sort of you know conditions but of course that you can come out of it too uhm uhm you know and there have been cases of like you know like tan tock seng was a hawker uhm uhm  word vegetable seller well this is a hawker i guess same and uh you know and then he went rich word  there are lots people like that from rags to riches kind of story not lots lah carol quite a lot right i mean i mean there are just that we don't know like especially those back those from china and all that ya when they in to first work now they they have they own land and  word carol no buildings and stuff historical evidence shows uh shows that uhm historical evidence uh points to the fact that very few actually have made to to the upper echelon most most of the collies that came here well maybe they became middle class over uhm uhm generations but they didn't like become rich overnight not overnight lah of course not overnight they worked very hard they as word individuals did did not uhm uhm but their their the generation that follow after them uhm ya so you have got very few cases like people like lok yoon uh tan tok seng they came from china now very few of those who like come out make it to the top uhm uhm very few it is more likely that their descendants uhm hopefully do something about it uhm uhm ya i suppose ya well our pastor don't believe in reincarnation uhm ya ya i think it is possible i don't think so  word not possible either whichever ya i suppose you mean you can hold to your own beliefs lah but it is just like god i mean sometimes you man i mean oh did you read the latest readers' digest oh on what steven hawkins no his his uhm his book the history of time no that became word  that is the latest one is it i haven't read the latest uh hah no it is very interesting go and read it in fact one thing that led to the divorce of him and his wife was religion cause he never believed in a god apparently he is the greatest synthesis after uhm einstein uhm and uh oh is it the is he the one who is presen pra paraplegic yes he is ah okay he is very famous ya ya ya i remember the name ya steven hawkins ya if you read like the second part of straits times i think many a time he's been featured already uhm uhm ya so any way they made one of his books into a movie and oh did you go to for the film festival no did you uhm no but adeline went for one of the opening uhm uhm one of the opening opening shows ah shows the crying game oh ya it is suppose to be you you saw it right i saw it ya it is it's one it's one it's in the you cannot tell me the ending right you are not supposed to tell me ya it will be kind to me i got to see it eventually lah you have to see it word  ya the thing is that i don't which theatres though it's kind of obscure places no lah there are all sorts of interesting twists to it uhm you know it is like it is very british word you can imagine uh uh you know the british coming out with something like that i is a british film you mean it is a british film oh ai yoh my friend went to see it and she said it was very good also they have you know you said it was very good so uh ah ya must go see it lah i figured that we get movies like after two months uh after america has it ya uhm well it is better than those days when you used to get them about one year or two years later really remember those days it was like we get it so late ah right six seven about a year later we get the film oh ya but now it is almost quite quite close  word little mermaid little mermaid uh hah we have it in just after because when i saw it in the states i mean then i came back my goodness after several months they showed it i thought this is dingish word  in the states they already have it on video tapes oh and the people here are watching it in the movies uhm uhm crazy i guess there is a backlog of movies to be shown you see so backlog i mean uhm because we've always been behind time right no you know what it is like there are so few movie theatres
