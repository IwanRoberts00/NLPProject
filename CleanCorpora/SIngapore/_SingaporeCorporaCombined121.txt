good evening and welcome to points of view it's taken a long time coming but we're finally having an open university it will become a reality by july this year the singapore open university provides a second chance for adults who've missed out on tertiary education they'll now be able to study for a local degree part-time just who are eligible we've been told that those with at least two 'a' levels can apply and others with a certificate in education or diploma from recognised institution here are also eligible the sou is expected to start with two degree programs a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science program both with honours options other programs may be introduced later on many of you may be wondering what an open university is like well britain has had an open university for the last twenty years let's take a look at how their system works the british open university's supposed to serve as a model for ours but peculiarities of the singapore environment will also have to be considered and to discuss just what the open university here should be like i have with me in the studio four panelists mr liew syn paw member of parliament for tanglin and gpc chairman for education dr gwee ee hian long-standing educationist of forty-two years and also executive director of the singapore chinese chambers of commerce and industry dr seet ai mee who've spent three months at the institute of south-east asian studies doing research on an open university and because educational poli policies have always had an impact on employment we have mr george abraham honorary secretary-general of the singapore federation of chambers of commerce and industry to give the employers' perspective also joining us in tonight's discussion are former students of the british open university local graduates and non-graduates as well as professionals well we've what the british open university model is like uh what can the singapore open university be like and what can it do for this society mr liew word you'd like to begin yes i think first of all the open university in singapore can provide our working adults who've missed out on a university degree with a second chance to go back and pursue a degree while working at the same time it will also enable our workers to upgrade and to acquire new knowledge and skills uh so that they can make career switches or changes and it will also meet the needs of those who want to get a degree for self-actualisation or self-fulfilment it will also raise the talent pool in singapore of professional managerial and uh administrative staff and this will make singapore even more competitive in this region in the world and of course lastly it will bring us one step nearer to being the education centre of this region uhm dr gwee as an educationist of such long-standing do you agree with uh mr liew's last point that we could become a centre for education uh yes i would think so i think uh we already have a sub-system of uh higher education i mean we all know it uh lots of people are pursuing uh studies leading to external degrees of london university and uh various twinning programs are also uh operating in the sim and couple of other institutions also i feel that a large number would like to be in the system had it not been for the high cost the relatively high cost of uh reading for a degree therefore the open university meets a really very real need in singapore how open it is you know i think that's the question you see i do not know we can discuss later on correct well i think that is something that we will be discussing in this discussion dr seet what is your research or what do you think an open university could contribute to our society well recently our ministers have been talking about levelling up economically and uh at when i was in the ministry of education i talked about raising the base of the education pyramid i think the open university can do this effectively i don't think you level up by pulling the people at the top the levelling up has to be moving the people at the bottom up to a sec to a to a higher notch and i think this uh open university will be performing this as its major role for society uhm mr abraham what would the employers' point of view be i think the most important factor is that it provides flexibility to a system that is usually seen to be rigid it allows people to learn at their own pace uhm and also for those who have picked up experience in their work it would be a an opportunity for them to relate to work that they are doing to some of the studies that they are doing uhm and i think employers would look upon it positively because if their employees show an interest in bettering themselves i think it speaks for a certain degree of motivation that exists in that individual uhm well let's take the question over to the audience now we have in fact two people jacky and christopher who have been through the british open university system perhaps you could tell us what it did for you jacky what was your experience mrs word what do you think would be some of the social uhm considerations that we have in our environment as far as an open university is concerned well there would be the question of whether people would want to take up a an open university course for self-fulfilment or for the sake of advancing their careers uhm and i think uh there should be room for both uh such students you know word wouldn't matter about their motives as long as they wanted to do the course and who are able to persevere with it i think it would be useful either category of student i personally know of people who are unable to go to university in the fifties and sixties uh because they have to support their families you know the father died or something like that happened and they have the qualifications to enter university and they couldn't and uh in a way these people have always regretted not having a degree and even if they are mature people now in their forties in their fifties i think they would be very happy to go back to studying and in order to you know have at last this kind of uh opportunity to uh enrich their minds so well eddie yeo one of those who's uh taking up a course is that to help your career or is it a a part of continuing education if i could take up the point you made about a possible glut of graduates does the panel see this happening what is the likely impact of this well i think we're still a long way from having a glut of graduates i believe now we've we only have about twelve percent of the each cohort coming out as a graduate and uh i'm quite sure that our economy can take many more graduates than twelve percent of each cohort and our aim in fact is to have twenty percent of uh graduates that's a long word and forty percent polytechnic graduates so i see perhaps this pool of forty percent who might graduate from poly might look for a further degree with the sou after they finish perhaps i don't think there will be a glut you know because if we insist on very high standards uh and uh from our experience we see that so many of our children cannot even or find it very difficult to pass the either the psle 'o' level 'a' level so uh that won't be really a glut unless god has been exceptionally kind to us that we've got so many talented people we always talk about the talent talent pool but i because of that precisely because of that uh i think we got to uh have a fairly good idea of what standard of our open university should be rather than just giving away paper simply because they miss their opportunity once during their lifetime so are you saying then that uhm it should be equivalent to the other traditional universities then yes it's very difficult to say what is equivalent or what is not equivalent but i would certainly like to peg our uh ba or bsc standard to the to our two universities at least i would agree wholeheartedly with doc uh dr gwee on this issue because i feel that it is important that standards be upheld because the university must produce graduates who then can hold their heads high with any other graduate in singapore or overseas and when this is established the future of the singapore open university is established so i think this is an a very important factor but there also have been criticisms that the minimum standards which have already come out of having two 'a' levels are in fact uh rather restrictive i mean are there any members of the audience who have a view on that but doesn't that in a sense uh you know deprive others who probably have a better chance of continuing right through uhm farrod you're one of those who've in fact done all your qualifications part-time while waiting while working uh tell us how much of a strain was it i mean it it was did you feel at times that you wanted to drop out uh i don't because unfortunately because uh i always wanted to go to university and because the consensus i've to work first and that being the case uh i more or less self-motivated to finish the course word  word do but i do find that what you need is discipline discipline discipline and that is really the the the the the ultimatum of uh part-time education zulklifi you have a different point you you believe that standards can in fact be maintained after a person has enrolled rather than at the admission level i think the question of standards at the moment can be quite speculative because it's not uh a question of just the candidates or the question of the support facility they have had at the university the lecturers the whole set-up has got to be uh word to and not only that uhm it depends very much on the first batch of graduates and succeeding ones uh prove that they can uh be uh very useful uh practitioners having gone through university uh having said that standards must be maintained and i think if you talk about having an university that's geared towards people who are already working for example technicians wanting to improve themselves to engineers i think most likely not only they're self-motivated they are already in that field of in that in that area they are better able to understand uh work in a technical area i think that is fine but certainly you you cannot overcome you can't overcome the fear of you know having to maintain the standards tend to agree with the question of standards because we do not want a situation where people end up discriminating against the universities and making the sou into a second-class university because i think the points that have been made is a fact that it's not just a combination of the curriculum but also the people who are doing the program the important thing that we have to understand it is the time frame that is given to these people that is different from the standard university format and so they are able to us that to their advantage then i think if the basic standards are kept the kind of graduates that come out of the sou would be the type that employers would be quite happy to have in their organization  hmh perhaps at this point we can move on to what form the open university uhm should take we've had very bare details so far we know there will be two basic courses in arts in sciences uh but perhaps um dr seet you could tell us you know what your views are on curriculum planning do you think basic degrees in arts and sciences suffice? well traditionally all the open universities throughout the world have had uh situations where they started with target audiences or target groups and the main target group has been primary school teachers who need to update and get degrees so this is essentially what's happening i i believe that's why the ministry of education is offering arts and sciences but in singapore there's a second target group and that is the seventy thousand polytechnic graduates who've graduated over the last twenty years so there is a second group here in singapore compared to the first group so i believe that uh the open university should move into a technology based uh uh teaching at distanced level this uh discussion has also centred mainly on the basic degree uh again traditionally open universities throughout the world have it started with basic degrees and found them that they have a second and very important role and that is of continuing education you cannot have an effective continuing education body without a very strong academic base so it is necessary to almost have a university to have a good continuing education program so as a result we find that the uk ou when they first started they did not look at it as a very important program but within seven years ten years they moved into a very large continuing education program and if you now assess uk ou uh sukotai tamaterak university almost all the open universities in the world you find that uh the undergraduate program consists of about twenty-five to thirty percent of the enrolment of the open university and the majority uh of the students are on continuing education program i feel this is a very important uh factor and i i believe sou will move along this direction because technology goes out of date within five to ten years and one of the grouses of forty to fifty year old uh employees have been that they are redundant sou can and should address this problem of technology redundancy by offering continuing education program well you've talked about the importance on a national level but let's ask somebody in the audience here colin for example you're in insurance do you think continuing education is important? would you go to the sou for continuing education? colin e: as an employer myself i find people come back with basic degree with mbas without experience in the uh technological field and i i can see the danger because the the the the the uh success ladder every round is a degree the additional degree you get the faster you move but there there may be a danger because as you move faster in that round for those who have no experience the matured the experienced people will be overtaken will be sidelined so there is a danger there so i think where that's where the open university should come in here and say okay these are the people to dislodge in in this paper chase let's do something for them so that they can stay in their in in the rat race while going up the ladder so i think that's where the sou come very important here edmund is that true that employers really look at the uh piece of paper before they decide to take someone on
