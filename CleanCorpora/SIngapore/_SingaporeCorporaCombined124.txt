 the great marriage debate revisited  good evening and welcome to points of view not enough married people and not enough babies that was the message almost ten years ago what followed became known as the great marriage debate since then a lot has been done to encourage singles to get married i'm sure you've heard of the sdu sds and sps these are specialized groups that have been set up to cater to singles from all walks of life and yet the number of marriages has not increased and even those who are getting married are doing so later and having children later as well tonight we ask why why is this pattern of delayed marriage and parenthood still so widespread even after attempts to change it to discuss this i have with me experts and laymen both single and married mr k shanmugam who's the mp for the sembawang grc is also with us tonight i also have with me two people who typify married people and single people let's start with you terry you're a bachelor and you've got many friends who are also singles why do you think singles are delaying marriage well i'm not sure if i actually typify the actual bachelor so i'll just say this for myself but you find that uhm in many situation they they people are being pushed to excel in their career they want to go places they want to travel they want to get experience in working overseas and things like that don't work very well when you are actually within a marriage when you got uhm a wife and two kids to bring along with you and i think that tends to put people uh to make people want to push marriage further until they've actually gone through that kind of thing weng hee as a married man do you think that his points are valid yes basically i would agree with what terry has said but i'd like to add on and say that singaporeans these days aspire to a standard of living characterized by material comfort and a lot of independence a lot of freedom and as a result they now perceive marriage as an institution which will impose on their financial well-being and on their independence hence uh they'll want to have a good life they want to achieve before they finally settle down is are these points valid 'achievement-oriented people' 'career-minded people' is it all valid well these days actually their education opportunities and work opportunities are much greater i think it's natural when these opportunities are available people tend to marry a bit later firstly they'll finish education much later and then they had have to establish their career so i think it's not uh something we don't expect if marriage is being delayed where did this mindset arise though is it something that we've been brought up to think i think that's that's true because since young we have been conditioned to think that you know we have to go through various stages first you go to say primary school secondary school after that jc university and during that path you're not allowed to think about anything else so the the mindset is is has been conditioned from right from young ya i recall that as a junior college student uhm courtship was frowned upon we were told 'go and complete your studies' uh 'go into national service you'll be more matured uh the the the after having gone through the process of national service go to university study develop a career and then you can uh think about marriage for some reason uh students who actually have steady girlfriends in junior college days are perceived as students who are not serious in their work there's a stigma attached to uh being involved in a relationship in junior college but is this stigma something that we carry with us over into our working lives and into our adulthood i think perhaps it's much more really the structure because both the last two have mentioned really what a macro thing the kind of society we live in that they that the expectations of us are different the opportunities are different i mean in the old days there weren't that many nice things happen to you and getting married was one of the few really nice things now there are so many other nice and exciting things and i think in  word part of the kind of society we live in we see that more and more couples are opting for what i call companionate marriages and so uhm we do have uh people who go through a sort of a childless period and it's as if their life is in a holding pattern you know and then suddenly after many years then there's the arrival of the first child uhm but i think uh the norm is still that most people tend to associate marriage with parenthood well can't companionship like you said be achieved without marriage people can very happily have boyfriends or girlfriends steady relationships and not take a plunge and get married what's the difference well many people might ask that question which is why you find a significant number of of proportion of people uh choosing to stay single and uh choosing to have uh such friendships and without going into whether it's right or wrong or passing any moral judgements we must realize that there's there's such a feeling and uhm such an attitude and deal with that in the larger social context but should we be dealing with attitudes though because some people have considered that social engineering well i think perhaps uh you've got me wrong i i didn't suggest that you try and change such social attitudes well what you're saying well there is a perceived policy a suggestion that we should try and have as many as much well try and increase the number of marriages uh try and have people marry and if possible have children now that's stated as a larger social call but when you try and state that as a social call you must realize that there are significant number of people who will choose not to get married for various reasons economic social personal but in a free society we are entitled to do that and a large group of people who may choose to get married but not have children you must try and understand why they choose to do that and then i don't think it is there's anything wrong in trying to uh win their hearts by reason if you think it's better that they should get married and they should have children right before we of course try and win their hearts we have to look into uh reasons as to why people are still putting it off putting marriage off perhaps we can hear from one of the singles in our group edward well basically a very significant reason is uh financial reason marriage is not a cheap thing these days and i think a lot of people have got very high expectations what uh they expect of the marriage so it means that uh you you find people saving up for house some of them even want a landed property before they get married and uh it may be a bit uh too much of a high expectation but there it goes you know uh people do think that way well i i know a lot of people like to have a mercedes benz but that doesn't stop them from moving about by bus or mrt or even in a less expensive car you know comes down to a question of priorities doesn't it yes that's right are are these expectations uhm realistic well i'm not quite sure that i agree with edward in saying that uh financial considerations play a significant part because in the modern singapore you would find that both marriage partners are probably working so marriage does not per se impose a greater economic burden on either party i think it's more a question of whether people feel materially committed towards marriage and uh these may perhaps be additional factors the economic factors could may perhaps be additional factors but the more important factor is whether people feel that they can be involved in a relationship which is going to demand quite a bit out of them so it's one of attitude a different social value system  word i pick up on the point you made about commitment there are some people who would say well marriage is is too much of a commitment in a sense that it's a mental burden for them is this a fair judgement i think it's rather unfair because if you're not married how can you make a judgement it's too much of a commitment word  but then once you're married it's too late word  wrong well see this see this where perception comes in because the moment you have a pre-conceived idea as to what marriage is about then you may be put off getting married and and that's a concern there that the longer you delay then the less uh uh unfortunate it will be for singapore i'm inclined to believe that singaporeans generally value fidelity in marriage and they also look forward to a happy uh family life for that reason they are afraid to commit lest they may make a wrong decision it is this fear of making a wrong decision uh that actually prevents a lot from really committing to a relationship so you're saying that fear actually cripples some quarters of people is that right for you well fear perhaps might be too strong a word putting it in a context of a modern-day singapore to perhaps fairly ambitious individuals perhaps well-educated trying to live with each other trying to adjust themselves to each other it's not an easy thing to do and and uh perhaps fear might be too strong a word but certainly uhm the uh the it can be described that fact can be described as one of 'well i'm not quite sure that i'm prepared to make that many adjustments at this stage i prefer my freedom to the uh adjustments that i have to make if i commit' is that a selfish attitude though i don't think that is right to characterize that attitude as a selfish attitude because i'm not harming anyone else i'm should should be free to live my life as i wish so there is a very real argument for remaining single after all is that right i think actually word although the older generation are pictured as always encouraging the young to marry sometimes they have contributed to this fear of commitment because many of the older generation of parents kept emphasising to their children how much sacrifice they've made oh how what a burden life had been i'm not sure if that hasn't really contributed to the fear of commitment that people have mentioned even though it's come from a very conservative source not only that i think a lot of uh uh parents who tell their kids you know uh 'if you get married you know be sure you look after your children uh uh i'm not about to look after the kids for you after i've struggled all these years' i think that's not being supportive also because i if if indeed they are trying to promote uh the kids getting married faster then i think you know you might be prepared to also look to the grandchildren uh well speaking as a working grandmother i i i think we just have to face it with uh we will fewer and fewer as we get a higher proportion of grandmothers who've got complete in secondary schooling and the society says it needs everybody's labour contribution i agree the granny's the obvious one but i think we probably got to learn to do without her because society says everybody must you know take part in economic activity  actually i'm wondering if there's a clash there somewhere because when you're talking about uhm the parent giving a negative uhm connotation to the idea of marriage and all that i was thinking sometimes in many cases you don't really have a a a valid pattern to follow in terms of the parent because of the uhm rapid change of uh as word  as word i said progress social progress and economic progress the actual pattern and relationship and lifestyle of my parents don't actually apply anymore to to a uhm double-income family word  career you're saying that are you saying that we're lacking role models yes i think so is that true is that a valid point role-models i think i would tend to agree with with that because i think uhm young couples nowadays are what we call uh pioneers in a brave new world you know and then the old rules don't apply because the older generation always said 'oh we used to have ten a dozen' you know they grow like bean sprouts i mean what's the problem and then you know our generation today with the you know high emphasis on being achievers and and also i think cost of living things are actually are are actually becoming much more expensive and i know that even though when you talk about women having to do a juggling act but the men actually go through an intensifying act because they have to work that much harder they have to stay back in the office that longer hours to earn the extra dollar you know so sometimes when you when you talk about a priority like you want somebody to be career-risked uhm he is going to be so uhm you know hard-driving that he probably won't be able to spend that much time uhm at the homefront so i think we're really asking for a very different creature uh from the kinds of couples that used to get married say twenty thirty years ago
