hi i'm peter lim and it's mother's day hi mom and all the other mothers out there happy mother's day it's a happy coincidence that we're discussing men tonight after all all men come from women men come in various guises there's a gentleman the new man and remember the old brute then there are those confuse guys who make the girls feel so sorry for them so what's it really like to be a man in singapore today take me for example am i the typical male are you the model man and if you're a woman what is it take you expect of your man the ideal man to help us define or redefine the singapore man i have a fair distribution in the studio tonight one woman and two man let's get to know them hi janice it's good to see you again thanks we used to work together yes janice you are a journalist a wife and mother so i put it in the right order yes i think so no well mother first right absolutely and you are the columnist too doctor robert balhetchet can i call you bob yes certainly please do you're a mor moral educationalist and like me a bachelor oh sorry i didn't realise i had company i've company too and anthony you are a family therapist husband and a father welcome to the studio tonight we're talking about men singapore men and what society and women and men themselves expect of the singapore male so can i start with you you must be expect on the men well i hope not well janice you took a year's leave from work to look after your son ryan who is now three three years old right almost three but why did you take twelve months away from work why not your husband a simplistic answer would be i suppose that's because i'm his mother and that's expected of me but uhm i truly do feel that it is the woman's role to be the mother and as much as my husband loves our son and everything i think women do give uhm women were meant to be mothers and there's a nurturing quality to women that perhaps uh i hope i don't get into trouble but perhaps doesn't come as naturally to a man anthony are you reassured to hear that i am not you're not ya because one of the problems is that we sometimes do not let the man become a human being to allow that nurturing part of him to surface i think a man can also express this gentleness nurturing spirits and so on let's let's try and get into the minds of some of the uh male viewers tonight but how many do you think will agree with what anthony said uh maybe not too many i've often said i'm not too sure whether it's process or socialisation i tend to think it is but i don't think too many men would uh for instance uh cry readily in public or in front of someone else wouldn't mind if i cry in private well i own up but the whole what's the point of crying in i mean ya but uh you know out of sheer sorrow for instance let's say they they lost their wife or lost their mother they cry out of sheer grief you know uh but they jolly well make sure that nobody's around to see that because they'd feel that that that's being soft you know uhm i think that's the mentality of most men and believe me they're probably brought up like that i don't blame the men so you blame the mothers do you i think so in a sense because uh you you you see this with with every mother if a kid falls down and uh if it happens to your boy and he yells and cries the mother picks him up and say come on you're a big boy boys don't cry oh that that is being told to the chap from very young if a girl falls down and cry then no problem sayang the chap you know it's it's it's kind of natural you know i remember being told that many many times when i was a little kid boys don't cry you're a big boy now you don't cry so you know you you you grow with the mentality i mustn't cry and i agree with bob here you see there's a reality that we define men in a certain way women in a certain way and in that sense we limit the men they say in my therapy room we find men having that privacy that uh permissional most you know to express their emotions when in pain due to they do or they don't they do they do due to difficulties in life or or problem with relationship and i see a lot of man crying you know ice-sin:s1b-031#> so it's it's like so sad you know that you you you have to pay somebody for an opportunity to cry i mean wouldn't he be better if he brought up to to to be permitted to express emotions and perhaps express them appropriately too so that we do not get some men who have difficulty expressing emotions and then they end up with a lot of aggressive feelings and some of them then end up beating up their wives or hammering things or killing themselves or you know bestrewn things altogether i think i they be allowed to to get in touch with this part of themselves society now says singapore at least that men must change right and the the then prime minister in uh july 1990 says that uh new attitudes have to change if singapore women are to successfully juggle their roles at home and at work so society is demanding that bob are the men responding or are they getting more confused or more reactionary uhm i guess it's a bit difficult to answer that outright in terms of uh equality lie for instance equal pay and treatment and that sort of thing everything else being equal uh then i think you know that's that that much change i suppose if it adds to a large extent but there must be some areas which are you know there is still that kind of a differentiation but on the other hand uhm i would think it'd be totally unnecessary i wouldn't want men to change uh in terms of uh the niceties that he shows to a to a lady etceteras etceteras etceteras you know uhm i've been accused of being male chauvinist because i open doors for ladies uhm because it seems that's an indication that i consider the other sex weak i don't know weaker and they can't open their own doors so do you still do it absolutely and i think will absolutely defend and when i teach courtesy to to kids that i teach them to do it uhm because i think it's nice i've been told to stop doing it sorry i've been told to stop doing it yes so have i i was told that in public in in a discussion once you know that i was being chauvinist i said what carry on but i like being chauvinist and somehow or rather the female friends i mix with seem to like my chauvinism in that area at least you know janice which is how i feel actually men are quite confused you know uhm on the one hand they're expected to now be sensitive and emotional and those are very good i mean those are the things that keep a relationship alive at the same time the woman also i think i think if if if i can be used as an example i'm just your average woman right we also want the men to remain protective we also want the maleness you know of the men to come through so while i want him to learn to share his emotions with me to learn to to to nurturing and everything uhm i think i also have a responsibility to in teaching him how to bring it out because you can't just say the man has to change full stop and i am a woman and i demand this i know i depend on my husband for all the practical things in life uhm he depends on me for the emotional support that i can give you know so it's it's a partnership lah you know i i come to think in the sense it's sad lah you know i don't think we should just focus on men's changing you know because men has to change in relation to something and it's in realism to the changing expectations of women as well of word even other men so i i agree with you in that sense i mean it has to be something mutual and i also agree that there is this confusion that is setting because with all the demands of men to change sometimes the man is not quite sure as to what he ought to be you see at the end of the day and that may add to the confusion i suppose but do you personally feel confused do you or do you what you should be i suppose i suppose that there's some point you can be because then you ask yourself what do they want you see so you're you're told for example okay you you you you must let the woman be more than that you know passive uh submissive person so you let her be okay but then the next moment you stand back and you refuse to open the door for her for example and then she just much in then then you get the snag remark that you don't want to wait for me first you know open the door i think there's a different issue between chauvinism and gallantry there's some confusion i'm i'm just it's a maybe a silly minor example but but there's a bit of confusion there so likewise with other areas to in just with what janice is saying you know what we're talking about letting the men express emotions some women cannot handle that because the moment you see that coming out from the man you think he's being less than a man when like i said before you said it's actually being more human you see so that may lead to the confusion well we talked about uh different demands on men which are causing confusion among men and you you of all people i'm surprise to hear that you too are a bit confused uh you mentioned maleness and after the break i'll like to ask you to elaborate on that it's time for a commercial break we'll be back before the break we are talking about how confused we poor men are bob and i have two things in common at least we're both bachelors and both of us have been scolded by women for opening car doors and other doors for them anthony in the other hand have has seen men being scolded for not opening doors for women so janice what do you women want i don't know uhm i think women want a balance and i think there's a difference between chauvinism and just plain politeness or gallantry old world chunk and i think if you if women want to bring it down to something as ridiculous as don't open the door for me because i'm macho enough to open my own door then it's i think bringing things to the extreme but there are different there're women with different attitudes right ya so you represent the middle ground middle ground i enjoy being a woman okay  but that doesn't mean i enjoy being trampled on by the men there are certain roles i think of the men has to play just as there are certain roles that a woman plays is just you know it's just the way of the world right and which is not so that if he cries he's being less of a man but there are certain things a certain take chargeness uhm a woman i think must feel that she can depend on her man you know not to fall to pieces in a crisis to be able to make decisions for the family if they cannot reach some somebody has to you know to to to be a leader to be to be the person that you can depend on he is the person that uhm there's certain male attributes that he should have lah you know is it that's that's not necessary that's not necessary being male you know i think i think it is and apart from that is it unfair burden to the poor guy precisely precisely you see so why should the man be burdened with all these responsibilities because the wife has to take care of the running of the household so that word him to but the man the man the man the man is also changing and and why can't the man uh woman be the provider as well so that the man can make a change too he can do other things that he wants to because if you do not allow the man to do that then you get to a position where the woman have choices you see she can decide that this is what i like to do i like to be a full-time mother i like to be part-time mother i like to be full-time worker outside i like to do this or that but the man has no choice virtually he has all the responsibilities of being the provider the decision-maker the take charge person you know word can't even out no no no i'm saying when it comes to the crunch you know somebody must why can't it be the woman if the woman can make up her mind sure you why why not i mean as a man i'll like the woman to do that too so that in a sense we then you know allow for this interchangibility because i these are not necessary static roles you see i mean and they can be flexible and there can be interchangibility between the man and the woman
