there are two short points really in this appeal which are plainly on the evidence act but before i take your lordships into the middle of that i ought to give your lordships a slight or a fair amount of the background of this case the claim itself is for the alleged sale of about six hundred and forty thousand shares at three dollars and fifty-six cents in a limited company the completion date for that according to the claim was september of nineteen eighty-three the consideration for the delay until completion was that the defendant the appellant in this case would service an overdraft account at fee of the respondents' banks this went on to september eighty-four well past completion date when for reasons which i will come to in a moment interest on the overdraft account stopped in december eighty-four the plaintiff respondent sold out and there was a shortfall of approximately one and a half million dollars some time soon after that two sums of twenty thousand and thirty thousand were paid by the or were paid to the plaintiff my lord now that is the claim the defence there are two parts to the defence your honours the first one is that the defendant applied to strike out the claim against him on the ground that he was not the defendant or the person who is alleged to be the person who purchased the shares that's been adjourned sine die the other was based on an order fourteen application for summary judgment and that came before the learned registrar for hearing on a number of occasions and basically this is what the defendant's claim is the shares were sold it was an oral sale there's nothing in writing the defendant says or rather the defence is that khoo i call him for short khoo the broker says it was a sale to one gosali it wasn't a sale but an option to purchase the option to last for twenty-four months meantime it was to service the overdraft account gosali an indonesian filed an affidavit confirming this and that he was the buyer and then we come to this point your honour where there was a series of discussions when this fifty thousand dollars in two sums were paid now mister gosali put in his account or part of his account to show that in fact he had paid this interest and your honour will perhaps look at page one hundred and twenty-eight of the record where he lists out the various payments he made through a firm associated with the defendant now this is where the link has come in my lord that's at page one hundred and twenty-nine of the record i bring this out my lord because this startling point must have shaken the plaintiff's claim because this is a certified account my lord showing the interest payments and they go back a number of years my lord or over a certain period now this is all filed in the summary proceedings and the issue that came up immediately after that when affidavits were filed my lord on two matters which are set out in the which i will come to in a moment which were set out in the affidavits of the parties now the first the complaint your honour are really at page one hundred and nine where you will find my lord that mister gosali or mister khoo says and i ought to go through this now my lord because this is where the crux of this case is at page one hundred and nine of the record at the second paragraph there my lord i approached mister gosali with the information given to me by the plaintiff and asked him if he was interested in acquiring the plaintiff's shares on the terms mentioned and after some discussion relating to the information given by the plaintiff he agreed to take up the option by october eighty-four the shares had dropped heavily in value and it was discovered that the representations or information given by the plaintiff was false or inaccurate mister gosali then began to have different views regarding the exercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of mister gosali and the plaintiff the option was cancelled now this is mister khoo's statement your honour and mister gosali just the same and supports this statement my lord now immediately after that the plaintiff filed in an affidavit at page one hundred and thirty-four as to the rest of the said affidavit and the affidavit of erwan gosali i crave leave to refer to my affidavit of eighteenth february nineteen eighty-six i do not know who erwan gosali is and have never heard of him i crave leave to refer to paragraph ten of the affidavit of erwan gosali the negotiations were carried out between the defendant himself and on his behalf by john khoo with mister subhas anandan and were on the methods of payment of the shortfall represented by the agreed price of two million two hundred and seventy-eight thousand and four hundred less the total proceeds of six hundred and ninety six thousand and seventy-nine from the sale of s p p limited shares in the market one of the proposals put forth by the defendant to mister subhas anandan to pay the shortfall of one million five hundred and eighty-two thousand and two hundred and thirty-one plus the outstanding interest was by way of transfer of three units of housing at one tree hill gardens being developed by t k lim realty limited defendant's company annexed hereto is the copy of the telex from john khoo to subhas anandan a copy of telex marked g from mister subhas anandan to the said john khoo and a copy of a letter from john khoo to mister subhas anandan marked h giving specifications and built-up areas of the units offered by the defendant the proposal was aborted as the development was encumbered and no satisfactory proposal to life the encumbrances came from the defendant now my lords that's the first reply to gosali and to mister khoo now mister khoo then filed some affidavits it's at page one hundred and sixty-four at the bottom of the page my lord as regards paragraph eleven of the said affidavit i deny that there was any representation made by me on behalf of the defendant to mister subhas anandan who was acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations regarding the balance of the overdraft interest and not the alleged shortfall claim against the defendant mister subhas anandan had certain bias or interest in the property referred to therein and had requested more particulars thereof can i read that again my lord as regards paragraph eleven of the affidavit i deny there was any representation made by me on behalf of defendant to mister subhas anandan who was acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations the emphasis my lord at that point of time this is without prejudice this was also taken at a point of time immediately after the plaintiff put in his affidavit now my lord after that mister chew goes straightaway and files an affidavit at page one hundred and seventy-one where he lists out the various proposals and goes deeper into the negotiations my lord as to paragraph nine that's page one hundred and seventy-one as to paragraph nine of the affidavit annexed hereto and marked c g four it's a draft prepared by mister subhas anandan which incorporated one of the proposals made by the defendant for securing payment of the amount claimed by the plaintiff by the issue of shares to the plaintiff by alitier private limited which shares were to be paid for by capitalisation of the defendant's loans to his own family company the proposal set out in so and so fell through and defendant offered to transfer three units of housing in the one tree hill garden for this purpose i had the valuation of the units made annexed here is a copy letter to mister subhas anandan dated twenty-fifth january eighty-five enclosing the valuation the price of the units to be transferred to the plaintiff was to be the payment of the amount due to the plaintiff as the price of the three units pegged at two hundred and eighty dollars per square foot exceeded the amount of the plaintiff's claim the plaintiff eventually agreed to take two units and the balance of his claim to be paid by the defendant in cash i then instructed messengers goh poh and partners to help in drafting the agreement for this proposal i have heard that searches showed that the property was encumbered to the limit of five million annexed hereto is a copy of the company's search on alitier private limited showing the charges registered against the company and a copy of certificate of title showing the circumstances marked c r t seven goh poh and partners then wrote to messenger subhas anandan on twenty-ninth july as per annexed so and so my lord now the learned judge hearing the appeal from the registrar said that the door had been opened the initial statement made by gazali and khoo i haven't read gazali's one but i will now now i'll go back again to mister khoo first because it's important to know whether the door in fact had been opened it's at paragraph fifteen let me read it again my lord mister gazali then began to have different views regarding the exercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of mister gazali and the plaintiff the option was cancelled now gazali says your honour at page one hundred and twenty-eight my lord i missed that paragraph ten my lord of his affidavit gazali's affidavit after a series of discussions between the plaintiff and my intermediaries it was agreed in early december nineteen eighty-four i could abandon the option provided i paid interest in the sum of fifty thousand payable in two installments i duly paid the same now this is what is supposed to have opened the door to the negotiations because from then on mister khoo promptly pulls the door wide open and brings in various points that were raised and which are in the without prejudice negotiations which mister khoo properly said and gave notice in his affidavit these are without prejudice now of course the other side or rather the judge has held well you shouldn't have put in all these other facts if you say it's without prejudice why did you not just stop there and just say these are without prejudice it should be either struck out or removed from the record my lord i have an authority to this effect my lord that you are entitled to state your case in the event that you do not be allowed to treat these statements or documents as being in fact without prejudice the simple reason is a lot of people mark their letters or their statements without prejudice when there is no dispute and no negotiations as such in the sense that there is a pending court case and then they call it without prejudice you see it very often my lords i'm sure your lordships in your long careers must have seen this being used very freely it means nothing unless there is a dispute that's going to court the words without prejudice mean absolutely nothing make no effect they have no effect at all my lord you can say without waiving my rights and that doesn't prevent it becoming admissible now the last affidavit was done on the thirteenth of may my lord and on the twentieth that's three days after the application to strike out was made my lord now the two grounds that were given by the learned judge who heard the view or appeal was one that only the parties to the negotiations have this privilege no third party is entitled to it  now may i just point out my lord, and i've got it in the skeleton at page 3 my lord
