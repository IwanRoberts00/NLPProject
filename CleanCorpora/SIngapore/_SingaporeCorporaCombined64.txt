word i have values that shall we word a e how would i how would you react i was i was telling myself what should what would i do the thing about aids word  ya  word world wide i mean world wide i mean of course it changes lah now it is ecological you know why i mean i word  partly because the problem is no longer a western  word  it becomes a word  no longer of the of the developing world lah and because the problem started from the west right doesn't it doesn't no it kind of started from africa ya but it is like transported because of some western values you see so the thing is whether that problem uh has become a international thing and so definitely you mean to say the culprit is now the west that is why word  i think so you see it is no longer a it is it's it's no longer a western thing you know a lot of americans have aids you get what i mean now is that a lot of thais have aids because of what yes yes yes you know i know what you mean and you can't say it is because of the thais themselves someone must have forced it in order to under to accept that right you also accept responsibility of course so i would rather not talk about it
