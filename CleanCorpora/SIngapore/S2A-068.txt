""
may it please you my lord
""
we are finally here for the purpose of presenting to your lordship
our submissions on this matter and in respect of which the hearing has gone
on almost four days three days
""
in fact i have my lord at the beginning of this trial given to your
lordship the list of authorities i will be relying on in support of my
client's case and this morning my lord i have in fact given to my learned
friend and to your lordship's secretary a very brief submission on what the
issues are in this case
""
what i plan to do my lord is this as i see it from the defendant's
case what i plan to do my lord is this to perhaps just go through the issues
with your lordship and then with your lordship's permission to go through the
list of authorities and perhaps go through the law as well subject
""
of course at any time to your lordship stopping me and saying that
it will not be necessary for me go through it if your lordship has in fact
read through it
""
i have in fact in submitting these authorities highlighted in my
bundle the paragraphs that i will be reading
""
so with that my lord if i may be permitted to start
""
as i see it my lord the issues in this case are very simply did the
plaintiff when she transferred the subject property to the defendant intend
the transfer to be a gift of the property from her to her son
""
that's the first issue my lord that has to be decided upon
""
if it was a gift then that is the end of the matter with regard to
the subject property
""
if on the other hand my lord the court is of the view that it was
not a gift that the question that then comes up for consideration was whether
the as to whether or not the property was transferred to the defendant on the
terms that the defendant was to be a trustee of the property and he was to
re-transfer the property back to the plaintiff after she had obtained her
identity card
""
now with regard to this these two issues the plaintiffs of course
rely from their statements of claim on the point of undue influence
""
the third question that your lordship has to consider is whether
there were any conditions governing the use of the money held in the bank
account opened in the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant
""
my lord with regard to the first question the defendant's case is
that the property was transferred by the plaintiff by her own free will to
the defendant
""
now in support of this my lord i rely on the defendant's own
evidence as well as the evidence of the defendant's second witness
""
in further support of this statement i am also relying my lord on
the certificate of title which quite clearly indicate in the agreed bundle
that the property was transferred as a gift
""
of course my lord i concede that this evidence of the defendant is
denied by the plaintiff and hence therefore the court will have to decide as
to which of the parties testimony is to be believed
""
in short my lord the case falls on which of the two parties are to
be believed the plaintiff or the defendant
""
it's my case my lord that notwithstanding the cross-examination by
the plaintiff both the defendant and his witness have maintained their strong
position on the evidence
""
with regard to the second point it is my submission my lord that
the question of a trust cannot arise
""
this is because if it was so the transfer of title would have
evidenced and this in support further support of this i rely on the evidence
of the defendant to prove this
""
my lord having said this may i just draw your lordship's attention
to the pleading itself
""
the action itself my lord admittedly was commenced by a different
firm of solicitors to my learned friend
""
and in the supplemental bundle of pleadings at page six your
lordship will see from the amendments that were made to the pleadings as to
exactly what was the plaintiff's case before the twenty-sixth of july
nineteen eighty-eight when the amendment was when the statement of claim was
amended for the first time
""
before the amendment the plaintiff's case was that there was an
arrangement between the defendant and the plaintiff that she would have the
same right and enjoyment over the property prior to the transfer
""
when the amendment was made she says for the first time on the
twenty-sixth of july nineteen eighty-eight that the transfer was induced and
then she says it was without independent advice
""
for the first time these two allegations are made
""
and for the very first time she then states what the inducement is
""
i draw this to the court's attention because i think it plays an
important part when one comes to read the testimony of the plaintiff
""
if this was true if it was true that she was induced to transfer
the property and if it was true that she was induced to transfer the property
on the basis of undue influence my question my lord is why was this not
stated from the first moment she started this action
""
why has she held it back and only subsequently chosen to produce
this line of thinking
""
the query that i have is is this sincere or has this been built up
""
has this argument been built up by her in order to create a
situation where there was undue influence when in fact there was none
""
even with regard to the question of the transfer of the property
back to her the allegation that when she gets the identity card back the
defendant would have to transfer the property back to her surfaces for the
first time only after twenty-sixth july nineteen eighty-eight
""
and likewise the condition that the plaintiff should be allowed to
stay in the property for the rest of her life
""
has she been honest to this court in saying what she has said
""
add to it my lord is the fact that she now says that there was
ill-treatment
""
that's not much of a new point i concede because it was there
before the amendment was made
""
but certainly she has made the allegation even more serious by
stating that she was forced to move out of the property and has then sought
to rely on the care and concern of her two daughters for abode
""
my lord i draw this to the court's attention and leave the court to
draw its own inference as to why this has been stated at such a late juncture
""
looking at the amended looking at the defence of the defendant
there can be no doubt his stand has always been as it has been
""
and the amendments that were made in the amended defence were
merely the consequences of her sad and pitiful story as put up by her if it
is true
""
and if one looks at the defence one would see that it tallies very
much factually with what the plaintiff herself has admitted in this context
""
i refer to the allegations that she was performing illegal
abortions that she had a criminal record for that and the fact that he denies
that there would be a re-transfer of the property
""
the next point my lord which i would like to make is this namely
that i would ask the court to draw its own inference as to why it has taken
the plaintiff so long to commence this proceedings and to seek the court's
remedy for a declaration
""
your lordship would see when i go through the law that such an
inference can be drawn from the facts of this case
""
my lord it cannot be doubted from the evidence that has been
presented to this court that the plaintiff is not as educated as her son has
been who has been fortunate to be
""
but even he too my lord does not enjoy that sort of education that
perhaps the other two children of the plaintiff have
""
p w two she says is a programmer certainly it calls for education
much higher than what the defendant has prior to that being a school teacher
""
my lord it cannot be doubted further that the plaintiff is a
thrifty person very much a characteristic of perhaps that generation
""
but one has got to look at her in the light of her mother
sixty-nine years of age widowed since thirty-seven but with only one son and
two daughters
""
from the evidence that has been given to this court she denies that
she had made a gift of this property
""
she supports her argument by the evidence of p w two
""
if one goes through the evidence of p w one she admits her illegal
abortions when she admits her record
""
it confirms the evidence of the defendant on this
""
but where her evidence goes out of the way is on the question as to
whether there were conditions attached to the gift
""
here she relies for strength and support on the testimony of p w
two
""
my lord my client does not deny and his evidence bears it out and i
think the mother's evidence bears it out too that he loved his mother and his
mother loved him
""
but where the dispute comes about my lord is the fact that on the
unfortunate day when p w two choose to return back to the home and that
quarrel took place that that's when this whole case began
""
it is my submission my lord that if one looks at the evidence of p
w one objectively and then looks at the evidence of p w two in the light of
what the defence has said it is extremely clear that this whole litigation
has been motivated by and brought about by events that took place and the
circumstances and the relationship that now exists between p w two and the
defence witness one
""
having said this my lord may i be permitted to look at the evidence
of the defendant with regard to the transfer of the house notwithstanding
cross-examination by my learned friend
""
he maintains his point though perhaps in a strong and hard way that
there was never any conditions attached to the property being transferred to
him
""
he admits that there was the sad circumstances surrounding his
mother's record but denies in any way that that played any part in causing
her to transfer the property to him or was even instigated or motivated by
him that she should do so
""
that being so my lord one has got to therefore take out these
factors and see whether such a person as the plaintiff could have transferred
the property as a gift to the son
""
a little supplemental factor that comes into play is i think the
fact which cannot be denied that perhaps there was a bad relationship that
took off between the plaintiff and her daughter-in-law
""
it may have been prompted by the fact that the plaintiff had not
been invited for the defendant's wedding but then his evidence speaks for
itself when he said that it was a very simple ceremony that he had and that
there were only two witnesses present
""
i think my lord it must be so that in a muslim marriage the
witnesses can only be muslims
""
the evidence of d w two supports the point that the mother was
aware of the fact that her son was in the company was frequently in the
company of a muslim lady and subsequently converted to the faith
""
look at that my lord in the light of the character of the plaintiff
character of the defendant as set out by d w two 
""
my lord i think it's a fact to say that converts tend to be
stronger in their faith than born, people born in the faith and i think from
the opening evidence of the defendant it's quite clear that he is a staunch
muslim now brought up in the teachings like in all other religions that one
should respect one's parents
