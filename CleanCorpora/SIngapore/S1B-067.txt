that's all the activities involved in development
""

all the functions

""
""
yes you have to start it off with a systems study and then
this
""
""
investigation
""
""
investigation followed by the systems specifying specifying
the system and the design of the system
""
then you went on to the actual programming testing and integration
of all the
""
sorry

testing and
""

""
""
designing programming testing and integration
""
""
file conversion from existing systems

""
that's all included in
""
""
yes
""
""
all included in the project
""
""
yes
""
manual and the yes together
""
to make sure that everything is okay
""
that the outputs you know tally with what you have manual records
""
""
now throughout the whole project
""
whom did you deal with in datatronics
""
""
mister shaw
""
""
who was in charge of that project
""
""
he was the project manager
""
""
he was the project manager
""
""
mm and also the systems designer
""
""
systems designer
""
""
right
""
""
and all discussions and negotiations for the purchase of the
system were with whom in datatronics
""
""
with mister shaw
""
""
with mr shaw
""
""
yes
""
""
all discussions negotiations with him alone
""
""
yes
""
""
how often did he attend the office of s i s i r
""
""
when we first started off the project
""
when we were doing specification and design and a lot of the
technical work initially it was almost every day
""
then as the project progressed and it was more programming you
know and programming and testing
""
then he comes in when we have technical problems that need solving
""
""
i see
""
""
and also to oversee you know
""
oversee as a project manager to oversee it
""
so he came in maybe two or three times a week
""
""
two or three times a week
""
""
yes
""
""
when he attended your office
""
what were the office hours or what were the hours he kept
""
""
nine to five
""
but if there are problems and we had to solve them
""
then we would stay on till nine or ten until you know
""
""
nine or ten at night
""
""
until we get the problem solved or we are too tired
""
""
i see
""
can you remember roughly what his responsibilities were his
functions
""
""
yes
""
mainly he was the project manager the systems designer
""
he would you know oversee all the programming testing and
integration
""
he wrote the first drafts of all the functional specifications
""
first drafts of all the functional specifications
""
yes
""
then later on as you know
""
as the specifications developed
""
then he vetted you know all the enhancements of the specifications
""
and he also came in to solve technical problems related to you
know
""
all these aspects programming and testing
""
""
now miss sng
""
""
and
""
""
i'm sorry
""
i beg your pardon
""
""
i think initial training of the users and he was also
involved in that
""
""
training of users of the system
""
""
training of users of the computerized system
""
""
yes
""
now you knew that mister shaw left datatronics in may eighty two
""
""
eighty two yes
""
""
what was the state of the what was the progress then
""
""
we had one more application you know to develop
""
""
one more application
""
""
one more application
""
""
to develop
""
""
to develop
""
the last one
""
it was
""
yes job costing
""
yes
""
""
did datatronics after he left
""
did datatronics complete
""
""
no
""
we did not have anyone to replace him as a system designer and
project manager
""
and the assigned programmer was also away from the job
""
did not show up five
""
and project manager to replace mister shaw
""
and the assigned programmer was away from the job
""
i think the last five out of the last six weeks
""
so at that point and time we decided to terminate you know the
contract
""
""
you terminated the contract
""
""
yes
""
and because it was not satisfactorily completed
""
ten thousand i think was withheld as penalty for non-completion
""
""
ten thousand
""
""
ten thousand
""
""
so you are saying that datatronics failed to assign a proper
""
""
replacement for mister shaw
""
""
replacement for mister shaw
""
and after he left datatronics did s i s i r have any further
business with mister shaw
""
""
yes he
""
when i had problems i still you know contacted him and he advised
us on an informal basis
""
then when he started his own company we contracted with him to do
further enhancements on the applications
""
""
further enhancements on
""
""
on the applications
""
""
on the applications
""
""
yes
""
the seven applications that was
""
""
computerised applications
""
""
yes that was nineteen eighty three to eighty five period yes
""
""
and are those computerised applications still in operation
today
""
""
yes
""
""
no further questions my lord
""
""
now miss sng
""
you said that you knew the plaintiff as mister shaw as the project
manager and system designer
""
did you know whether he was a director or partner or employee of
the company datatronics
""
""
we considered him as you know in charge of the whole company
because he was the person we dealt with
""
""
i didn't quite get the last bit
""
""
we considered him as the person in charge of
""
""
of datatronics
""
i'm sorry
""
because
""
oh thank you my lord
""
""
so he could have been the owner of the company
""
he could have been the owner of the company as far as they were
concerned
""
yes my lord
""
when you appointed datatronics first
""
yes
""
""
i will assume he was
""
he did not specify his designation in any letters
""
""
but we did not know
""
okay
""
""
when you appointed datatronics
""
did you call for various quotations first
""
""
yes
""
""
did datatronics give the best price
""
""
yes
""
""
was there a vast difference between the datatronics'
quotation and the other quotations
""
""
not a big difference
""
the only company that we invited to provide a quotation was c s a
computer systems advisers
""
""
but the difference was still enough for you to appoint
datatronics
""
yes my lord
""
much obliged
""
yes my lord
""
not as much as that but that they had to be competitive initially
so that very little profits were made when they gave quotations
""
when mister shaw had left the company in nineteen eighty-two you
only consulted him informally
""
""
yes
""
""
and did not appoint his company until nineteen eighty-three
""
""
that was a different project
""
""
but for nineteen eighty-two there was no formal contact
between you and his company
""
""
formal contact as in appointment no
""
""
and you were the one who approached him
""
he did not approach you
""
""
as far as the project was concerned it was not completed so i
think he has an interest in you know the project
""
so we were in communication quite a lot as far as technical
problems
""
and as far as technical problems were concerned when we were faced
with a technical problem then i would call him up you see
""
tell me what to do next
""
that kind of thing
