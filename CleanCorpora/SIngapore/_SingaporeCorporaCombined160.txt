doctor balaji could you please give his honour your qualifications my qualifications i'm a m b b s singapore a fellow of the royal college of surgeons glasgow completed a neurosurgical residency in the united states at henry ford hospital and a board eligible neurosurgeon i have a paediatric neurosurgical fellowship from harvard university a what the last bit a paediatric neurosurgical fellowship from harvard doctor balaji when did you first qualify with the m b b s degree nineteen seventy nine and from when have you been involved in neuro surgery from nineteen eighty two and when did you become consultant neurosurgeon january this year in nineteen eighty four were you attached to the neuro surgery department at tan tock seng hospital particularly in september october november nineteen eighty four yes i believe so by that time would it be fair to say that you would have been holding the position of registrar in that department if you got acquainted with neuro surgery eighty two i was trainee in neuro surgery at that time doctor balaji did you come across the first plaintiff jeya wife of akkaiah whilst she was admitted to the neurosurgical unit of the tan tock seng hospital on eighteenth october nineteen eighty four i do not recollect looking after this patient at that time and looking at the record i do not see my involvement in her management at any time at that time so the only occasion on which you saw the first plaintiff was on the twentieth of august nineteen ninety for the purpose of making this report at page nineteen of the bundle yes how long did you see the first plaintiff during this consultation at the out patient dispensary forty five minutes about doctor balaji i may have to ask you a few questions from the records can you please confirm to the court that you have all the records from the hospital in relation to the first plaintiff the records are with doctor lai outside could we have the records i'm sorry your honour but i would like to have a do you have them yes now before we go to the records could you please kindly look at do you have a bundle plaintiff's bundle could you please turn to page nine is that mister baratham's report yes twenty fourth of september nineteen eighty five yes i have it in front of me you have that at the time when you were in the department of neuro surgery doctor baratham was the senior neurosurgeon and head of the department yes that is true now doctor baratham in this particular report states doctor balaji she sustained a head injury with a skull fracture and on x ray was found to have air inside her head this implied the possibility of infection and she was given prolonged course of antibiotics no definite effects result from her head injury but she was treated by the orthopaedic surgeon for various orthopaedic injuries please make reference to orthopaedic report now what would be your comment about the statement that there were no definite effects resulting from her head injury you have now doctor balaji you have now seen the records of this patient yes i would say i do not agree with that you do not agree with that yes for the following reasons if i may be allowed to give the reasons yes with that statement no definite effects result from her head injury yes for the following reasons one first with regard to the question of infection looking through the records you find that patient febrile for many days and sorry, patient yes when she was admitted in nineteen yes i didn't catch you what you said the patient had fever for many days while the patient was in hospital and when there is air in the head and the patient has a fever it must be assumed that most likely cause of the fever is an infection of the brain i also have the benefit of doctor ong's report and testing he just went by one of the functions of the frontal lobe which would be intellect which we can measure objectively using i q test the patient's i q test has dropped to below normal a normal i q being between eighty to one hundred and twenty range and what was the reading of the i q in the record i refer to page eighteen the second line the psychological assessment done showed her to be functioning at borderline range of intelligence i q sixty eight to seventy five no doctor balaji i think you are jumping the sequence we are still in eighty five this report at page eighteen is made in nineteen eighty seven yes so levels of intelligence do change you must agree so let's stick to ninety eighty five doctor baratham's report and you said that you did not agree with that statement for a variety of reasons and you were giving those reasons you see i disagreed with doctor baratham's statement in nineteen ninety in nineteen eighty five when doctor baratham was making his report i have no input into this matter so my decision or my statement or disagreement with him is based on information that is available to me in nineteen ninety whether i would have disagreed with him in nineteen eighty five when he wrote the report i don't know doctor balaji in nineteen eighty five if you had examined the first plaintiff would you have made the same statement as doctor baratham has made in his report no definite effects result from her head injury i don't know i would have to see the patient in order to give an opinion and not having seen the patient it's hard to say whether i would have given the same opinion or not doctor balaji doctor baratham clarified just now that at the time when he made his report on the twenty fourth of september nineteen eighty five he had not had the occasion to have a consultation with the patient but he made the report based on the hospital records i'm asking you that if you were in his shoes in nineteen eighty five no consultation with the first plaintiff purely based on the records would you have made that statement no why not because the patient stayed in hospital for a prolonged period of time patient was in hospital for at least a month there was air in the head which meant there was a fracture of the front part of the skull the patient had fever for many days and all this would have suggested to me a serious injury to the brain doctor balaji what do you understand by that statement that doctor baratham made no definite effects result from her head injury i would understand it to mean that he thought he could not be sure that the head injury caused all her problems can i ask you by reference to your records hospital records can you please tell his honour what were the complaints and condition of the first plaintiff at that time during the time of admission no we're talking about september eighty five well i'll take you through doctor balaji the patient was the first plaintiff was admitted on the eighteenth of april nineteen eight four she stayed in hospital for one month during that time that she stayed in hospital what were her persistent or common complaints when she came in she was confused she was not obeying any instructions this was at the time of the accident or at the time first day of admission two days after her admission her condition was still thought to be very poor about ten days after admission we have the first note that states that she is now conscious let his honour record want you are saying but the report doesn't state what level of mental activity there was but that's the first note of her being conscious so ten days after the admission she's conscious yes right and then it's about two months or rather one and a half months after admission you have the first note which states that she is now sounding a little rational irrational no sounding rational first note that she is not only conscious but she's now rational at least in the eyes of the doctor the medical officer who wrote that so the main complaint appears to have been fever and her mental functions please look at the report carefully are there any other complaints or condition that she suffered during that time from the date of admission to the time she was normal yes she has got thigh ulcers no i'm talking about from the neurological point of view from the neuro logic point of view no nothing else in the record no is there any reference to poor memory no is there any reference to incontinence no is there any reference to her inability to control her bowel no is there any reference to emotionally being emotionally labile no doctor balaji you said that only after ten days the record shows that she was in a conscious state yes right could you please look at page six of that bundle before you the plaintiff's bundle of documents which were given to you your honour page six of the p b you have that that's a report from doctor ong tze guan yes now in the first paragraph at the second sentence he says the above-named was admitted to the neuro logical unit on seventeenth october eighty four following a road traffic accident she was conscious but confused yes so does your record show that she was admitted in a conscious state or was she admitted in unconscious state the first neuro logic examination states it as follows confused but talking not obeying commands if i may just make but it must show that therefore she was conscious no if i might make a note about the word the interpretation of the word conscious consciousness from a neuro logic view in examining a person is a spectrum on one spectrum one end of it is the person who totally comatose without any kind of response and at the other extreme is a person who is totally normal in function and in between these there are gradations of consciousness and one of the important parameters we go by is whether the person can follow instructions if the person cannot follow instructions then a lot of those mental functions that you have asked about like memory emotional liability and all this cannot in any way be tested neither are they of any they're all impaired because that person is not in communication with his environment even though he is sort of awake in the sense that his eyes are open so that would be impaired consciousness but according to the hospital records she was not admitted in an unconscious state although she was not admitted in a comatose state but she was admitted so the person was confused is confused she's admitted confused unable to follow any instructions but not comatose not comatose and the reference to her becoming conscious on the tenth day after admission would you agree that that is the day when she can probably communicate with he environment understand instructions and so on yes that's probably when she began to follow some instructions now during the stage when a patient or person is not in a conscious state because she was not able to communicate with the environment would such a patient also have problems with incontinence and problems relating to controlling the bowel yes in the sense that they will not ask to go to the bathroom or things like that and so they have social incontinence the mechanism itself is working but they don't have the mental ability to take care of themselves
