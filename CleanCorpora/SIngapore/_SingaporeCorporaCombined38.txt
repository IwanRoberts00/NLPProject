this this pie it's my first time oh it's an experiment too ya it's a miracle i don't know how i can serve you all experiments  word this your potential word  word well actually a regular custard pie is when you make it with condensed milk whereas this is the custard pie with the custard powder the regular custard pie is when you bake the whole thing with the pie so that's why my pie i bake my pie crust separately and it cracked because usually for a regular after you make a pie crust you add this metallic thing to it you know it's like it's it's in a shape of like a high dish type thing and it's usually word  and you press it down so that when the pie bakes it wouldn't pluff up and break and i didn't do that you see i just had to take the risk ya i can i've only found that thing in the states maybe i should get my friends to you know send it to me uhm ya 'cos this is the first time i've made other pies but they've always been like you bake the whole thing uhm you know the cats are speaking  word ya hungry does it mean that you have to buy a lot of all these bowls and moulds and things like that ya i have plenty we've all sorts of things uh all the different shapes auntie dying
