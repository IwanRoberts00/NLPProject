gown and everything else
""

""
uhm after the camp right
""
after the camp because cecilia said she has a friend who who knows
some shops that will bring her around so she'll call me along
""
then the church started calling and writing in so quite difficult
the church to get a church
""
it's like those that allow us to book uh already it has been taken
that day
""
""
that's why ah
""
it's actually i
""
that's what siew hong was telling that you know book the the church
as early as possible you know
""
""
ya but then yet there are many churches that allow us to book
but they only allow us to book three months in advance
""
""
uhm
""
""
you know that all the confusion
""
""
so you have to make your list lah which one allow you to book
which one can convey the order
""
""
and now with the phone rates the phone charges
""
""
you have to spend a lot of money on it lah so you try
""
""
so i try to call as many as possible last week
""
 laughs 
""
uh try until saturday you know thirtieth of november

 laughs 
""
and it's not cheap you know i heard one place inter international
baptist church they charges nine hundred dollars you know

""
just for that afternoon
""
""
ya and then uhm we wrote in but already taken up that day that
we wanted actually they said still available you know so by that time we we
write in our letter two weeks later already taken up
""
maybe it's also good that it's been taken up so costly uh
""
nine hundred but on average about four hundred five hundred dollars
both lah the reception and the sanctuary

tomorrow i've got a tutorial to give some
""
""
to
""
""
to students uh
""
""
which group
""
""
teach them uh english language students third year students
""
""
ah ah
""
""
so teach them uh the library how to use the library the
catalogue
""
""
how long is the session
""
""
one hour
""
""
uhm
""
""
so i've to go and go back and prepare
""
""
one hour ah
""
""
ya so quite i think quite a lot of things to teach tell them
even the catalogue itself
""
there's so many things to tell them
""
""
it'll be held in the library
""
""
ya so then we also have the cd-rom
""
""
cd-rom
""
""
ya it's those computer is all the data in the computer
readable format so you go to the machine cd-rom
""
uh it's like uhm music those music disks like that you see but all
is data
""
so you just slot the whole thing in then you search
""
let's say you want journal articles and all that for a particular
subject you can do it
""
""
there's only one one tutorial class is it
""
""
uh we have a series for this uh this session for third year
students but uhm the response isn't very good
""
""
oh it's voluntary
""
""
uh suppose to come the students suppose to come but then uh
the other time i had a philo lecture one student turned up
""
""
ha
""
""
terrible
""
eight or nine of them you know that kind of thing
""
""
but you have to that means you've been giving lectures
""
""
uhm on and off not not all the time but next year there will
probably be more because we're going to have uhm sort of teach them link up
linc
""
the terminal the computer catalogue for all the first year
students if possible third year students as well
""
so there's going to be lots and lots of things to do ya so and
then fourth year students also going to have a more in-depth one one to-one
type when they do their academic exercises
""
ah we'll help them on their topic
""
so i think right from aug july up to i think one whole term first
term will be busy all the time so
""
""
do you enjoy giving lecture
""
""
""
because there's something i know rather than let's say if i were
to give a lecture to all teaching staff or or or you know those experts ha
then of course i'm
""
""
or or you you you you have to do that also
""
""
no i don't for those teaching staff they as and when they
come in a new staff we'll do
""
""
brief them
""
""
ya for that one-to-one basis yah that means we make an
appointment with them ask them to come to library uhm for let's say one hour
or so
""
we'll just show them how to use a catalogue show them all our
library bring them to the different department tell them what to do and all
that
""
""
you know most of the lecturers
""
""
not almost
""
depends on department like some new some new lecturers and all
that lah when when when it come
""
and then make an appointment with them then i know them by face
""
and all that others is like based on what i know is as an
undergrad
""
then i'm suppose to do uh estate management architecture
""
do this blur you know that day one one lecturer came and ask uh uh
ask me to help him lah so i went then
""
i don't know i can't really know the subject you see
""
so i can't
""
not that he ask me certain questions
""
i'm not very sure about what how to look up for it also
""
so it's uh a bit difficult for me
""
let's say if i do geography at least 
""
i know because i studied studied that subject before so anyway i
try to smoke my way through
""
 laughs 
""
""
oh you mean you bring him to the shelf uh
""
""
ya bring him to shelf and know like uh like depends on what
because different aspects let's say of architecture and all that you see so i
wouldn't be that sure lah better go two o'clock already
""
""
ya
