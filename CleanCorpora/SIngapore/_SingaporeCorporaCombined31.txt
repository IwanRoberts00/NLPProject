because uh  word david david is going to david says he will stop at the mrt station ya but i am sure oh but he ya uh he asked you to give jenson a call right ya jenson word   word we should have a dial uh question  word  seriously you consider about the the dl word  uh okay lah  word can record it uh uh no you have to go through the training phase first you know what what training phase there must be training what they teach you how to do it for you probably not much uh uhm but they will teach you how to do it how long is the training phase no it is it is continuous what oh you mean i i start in august ya we are leading on tuesday uh okay yes sir word  so like like i was saying they came to conduct the sessions uh who we meet every tuesday uh uhm so we can you will join us for every tuesday uh uh and then uh probably for a for two or three sessions uh  word time you are comfortable and then you will lead the class or co-lead together with somebody else's uh so in this case you are probably co- lead with me first but i thought you are at at uh stl oh ya then then you probably do it together with sin tiong uh uh but sin tiong will be promoted to dl he is he is always been with dl you know oh is it ya it is just that oh it is just that that he is too busy to or there are too many no because there are there are word too many he so he co- he co- he co-teach together with me so if i can't uh he i can't do it on those days then he will do it lah so he should be finished his exams soon right june uh june uh ya hopefully he passed i hope hopefully he passed i hope word  probably would lah if he passed then we will we celebrate with him if not we will moan with him uh ah don't forget me don't worry uh i will i will cut for you august uh august august twentieth we will be starting again okay so uh if you want then you probably can join us in august uh that will give me a lot of time to think about it the communal-wise not too bad now right uh you are confused word  uh all right huh i am i may not want to go to ministry of labour for my attachment uh why not don't know whether got time maybe later next year lah why got no time you still got a lot of time got lah got lah if you don't do it now you won't do it later you know i know and i still find it very useful because the only person that still still maintains that contact uh uhm  word uh is only is only me uh me and tze peng that kind of uh uh uh but tze peng one is still quite far tze peng only contacts within word for two days you see i thought i will go before september because i want to  word  i want to attend the stats course one more time  word  ya i want to go after that huh but it must be a  word not more than three months you know huh ya but it must be a four month kind of a attachment otherwise ah yes otherwise you won't get to know the whole mechanics you know ya i but he they when i talked to jerry and the they didn't they didn't sound very keen uh maybe i talk to him again no actually they say okay you know it is good you know but they they cautioned me in that i should not uh look at the administrative side of it so much true ah true ah ya but it is not the administrative ya more for uh my own experience uh ah it is actually for the work experience exposure how you go about investigating a case uhm ya it is word that you can actually see a the whole area of factory ya which you will never get to see here moving out sub-factories word so it's actually very very narrow uh the only ones that you see actually word on and off you get to see a few electronics factories and that is about it uhm unless i go myself lah no you can't go word you see ya difficult lah no you can't you can't just word you can't just word into the factory uh ya ya quite difficult lah so i think i was thinking of starting in september october and november probably actually you may want to speak to hock siang and find out what is the best time to go uh ya he he because they have their peak periods and and down period ya uh the peak period meaning a lot of staff going on leave that kind of thing uhm get a chance to do more you see uhm because if you are there and everybody is there uh then you you won't have much you won't have much to do uh actually i have a word i i can take over what is his name uh that guy peter tay ah peter tay while he is doing his full-time course uh ah ya he is starting what he is starting from july ya word  so june the whole month the whole practically the whole year oh uhm they will love your your presence to a certain extent so what do they do there quite busy uh no lah not too too bad but you can investigate some of the case actually will be good they probably will not allow you to investigate the whole case uh but you can tag along you see you can even go with hock siang or go with people like siok lin who won't mind showing you the ropes uh that is the thing you see if i go uh for because i talked to hock siang he said it will take me at least one or two months right to be familiar to be able to be on my own uh that is what that is how long peter tay took ya two three months right but but you won't say i won't be useful to them that is the problem right uh certainly you won't be that useful lah but one one of the thing that you can offer them is that you can try to help them out to upgrade their computer system aiyah word  and you are using d base they use d base you are quite familiar right whoa i'm very familiar with d base uh least familiar very very familiar ah that is that is very good what because uh the only one that is helping them out now is this uh fifty something year old man who is retiring soon huh really ya okay lah i don't mind i you cos i am qualified because when i asked last spoke to hock siang in uh word  he said six months will be nice lah because six months will be a real help to them rather than uh uhm uhm might be just a burden to them no but you won't be a burden uh if you if you just tag along you see ya lah in all their visits that kind of thing ya true lah uh then at the during the times when you are free if you can help them out on the computer system  uhm uhm that side of the people will appreciate that because uh prior to this this guy uh chee lan uh somebody else did it for them i mean this engineer you know and he spent most of this time just doing all these thing and then he got so word he went he quit you know he quit the job and went to do a diploma in the in artificial intelligence is it ya oh iiss oh ya graduated and they have enough they have enough systems around what oh you might like to try cos the other thing i have to plan my dissertation i don't want to don't want to schedule my dissertation before march next year ya january lah
