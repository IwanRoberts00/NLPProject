great show isn't it oh yes ya great expectations i like the music a lot huh you like it's really good ya uhm i like the part which where she where finn was sitting in the gallery and then there was this lady singing soprano orh so opera music orh she just comes ya lor just sings like that i remember you laughed at that part ya why do you like that why there's no reason why   laughs  very cute  laughs  i mean i mean she sings like that but the voice sounds like it is from all over the place and the whole thing ya uhm ya i like the scenes how how they construct the things when it's out in the open in the buildings there's always leaves falling even though you don't see trees oh ya hor everything just falls and falls i like the beginning ya the sea so calm and then it was so frightening when suddenly this prisoner just jumps out from the the the the seabed  wah so scary  oh ya ya  true ya and it's very touching lah how someone who is poor and yet so kind at heart you know when you help the prisoner at first and he doesn't just meet him with the with with that what is that thing called the the pliers ah oh the pliers ah to to break open the the chains you know ya ya loh he even brought some food food and and jim bean jim oh that was jim bean laughter  oh i see uhm basically i think he's very kind at heart lah finn ya tell me do you like the scene when they first kiss  laughter  the boy the small boy and the small girl ya it was so innocent the fountain right  nice right  so innocent so nice ya ya 3 times it happened is it first time was that second was in new york the same type of fountain that they first kissed on the third time ah underneath the water again but this time was the pouring the pouring rain ah oh ya they kiss one more time very passionately notice the difference the fountain the fountain and then the pouring rain uhm ya i mean i mean it's quite heartening to know you know from nothing he became somebody and he he manages to realize his talent  ya  in art in painting ya and so undiscovered uhm but he he thought he thought the the benefactor was the old lady ya correct estella's aunt  and word maid ya ya that's why he's doing this he doing this for her he's under the impression ya he thought that the aunt wanted uhm him to be on the the same level  same standing as estella  ya ya  so so that so that they can be together uhm so it's all along he's under this impression ya that's so sad aiyah but i like the first time uh finn met estella ya when she was only ten years old and he was seated there when she was well trained already  laughter  to be a wah don't know what monster uhm well trained by the aunt ya she i didn't like her look then you know wah she really looked so cold and like like a snob like what finn says ya ya i like the scenes lah i don't know why every every every frame well it's like a picture itself the rustling wind especially the old houses the first part okay everything looks  so run-down  ya so run-down but yet so beautiful in a way uhm everything looks like a picture it's print very very nicely even the part where the prisoner the final benefactor he died then the thing roll down on the floor and roll down on the things  one of their bottles  it's too beautiful and ya when he died you see the screen the windows behind see sunlight the buildings and trees and everything uhm but i didn't understand the part when the three big fellows or bad guys the bad guys ya gangsters they trying to kill the the benefactor  ya  he's trying to kill him correct they had something going between them he did say uh they when they when when the when robert deniro the guy was in his was in the his his his painting room then then robert deniro was just saying that oh these guys wanted to settle a score with me uhm it's an old score he didn't say it's like the past caught up with him it's just the past lah uhm ya lah robert deniro did a lot of bad things but he said that there's few good things he did one good thing he did ya which is very very nice  which was to help finn realize uh his talent ya i was so confused i was like wondering where where he got the notion that he likes to draw uhm oh ya ah then i remembered it was the it was the oh yes book it fell out of his hand into the water and he kept it ya the first part is so important when when finn was at the seaside and he just drew the fishes he saw the birds that he saw ya so touching hor robert deniro actually kept the book ya i thought it fell into the sea ya he was so rough then  laughter ya whisper whisper your name ya ya but very nice i thought very nice very nice movie ya especially the music uhm cause it's set in the modern time lah the books tells more ya uses the that so called different kind of english ya and that ah you see in the book does it talk about the upper class and the lower class of society hor  oh yes  oh yes so pretentious ah the higher class the buildings look so monotonous right you get the feeling the art gallery the buildings that you walk through the subway everything look so monotonous it's only when it's in the open oh yeah like the the it looks like the the water run down the leaves rush everywhere stuff like that uhm and how it comes it went one full circle when when finn comes back to his  house again to visit his uncle joe  ya correct  correct and how the benefactor appear in the first and the last part everything like a sandwich like that lah <$a < ya sandwich ah ya very nice uhm very nice quite a sweet show lah and   very nice  i like the part so touching the joe came back his uncle came came to visit his art gallery   oh the opening of the gallery ya and he didn't know how to behave and ya laughs  he was confused already he was like part of the upper class but uhm at the brink of it ya just ya it's very sad so although he realized finn realises his dream of bring an artist and and being so-called rich to match uhm estella's status you know uhm estella whom he loved very much right here he felt very empty uhm ya he felt very empty and he he he lost himself i thought ya ya ya he lost himself but his sole aim is to find estella his love   you know   ya ya  but why did tell me in the book why why did estella i thought they like can't remember laughs  they came to but why i thought they like professed their love for each other and then the next moment she left to get married with the   other guy   the other guy  maybe it's like what you say loh uhm she's just so estella is just so well trained by the auntie you know uhm to to so called don't allow man ah to to to hurt you  hurt man  in that way right right estella i mean the auntie became mad because you know she was left alone by the by the fiancÃ© at the altar  correct ya  so that a lot of deep hatred for men uhm so train the niece not to be hurt by men in this way you know uhm ya something like that lah ya i get it actually come to think about it actually uh this movie speaks very badly about men leh  laugher  hah why why why so why i mean   don't know leh  remember the wo the lady says men are the bad things in life because she had a bad experience you know she was left at the altar but we don't know why ya but it's beautiful in that how i mean finn got got a chance to realise himself right he's quite innocent lah hor innocent do you think it's a love story also it is a love story lah to me to me it's a love story lor uhm what is it to you ya in a way it is it's about men men again  laughter  okay let it out an artist reborn laughter  ah okay but it is also about the prisoner you know so so called low-class you know did a lot of bad things uhm uhm and yet so although he's bad he can still do one good thing you know you know he help he helps finn to you know become who he is you know uhm uhm and yet the upper class supposedly to have everything but then they what good did they do  ya  ya they're so pretentious everyone dressed up in their black tie and like the coat and everything   ya uhm  and they make their stupid jokes you remember the part they asked asked uh finn how much do you charge your paintings by oh ya  laughter  by the inch or by the how long it takes how long it takes or by and stuff like that   uhm ya  so it says bad things about the upper class in a way ya it's pretty clear it's pretty clear ya clear nice lah very i find it very nice uhm quite empty right the lives they have the upper class   very ya very  they dress up so well but actually i don't know i kind of like that kind of life where you just go to seem just be with nature like what finn and and and did at the beginning you know ya in the beginning the narration was beautiful lor ya some some of the things finn says but can't really can't really remember but it says like you know that when benefactor experience uhm when he says like uhm like uh ya when you look from over her a little bit it's a bit noisy there   ya right  but i can't hear what he was saying oh ya ya he was saying something like let me think ah let me think uh oh after that benefactor experience when the small kid he says something like sometimes in life uh no not in life sometimes you have a look just a little brush with real life uh ya and that's when you really experience you know what life can really be that tremendous experience that he has as a kid when robert deniro like captured him and made him made him do certain things and things like that uhm ya that that i i i also like that part when uh finn says i'd like to tell the story not as it happens ah but as i remember  ya as you remember ya that's beautiful that's just like you right you like to remember things i mean you you that's how we remember ya what we remember is always the assets ya the assets and the beauty of it the feelings you don't really remember the actual things hor you know events and things like that  well so finally when he become so called successful he went back to his his old life and and and i think that's where he finds himself again you know uhm and then he went back to the the run-down house where he's supposed to do the gardening with the { once years ago { correct and then what did he saw what did he saw or who did he saw uh huh the little girl { again right { the little girl ya the little girl again don't tell me that's estella again ya but but the first thing he said was i saw her again i saw her again and he thought she was stella but actually she's a little girl who looks like 'stella when she was young ya some of the lines are very nice ah like uh i saw her again ya it set some expectations ya uhm and then then the camera like what you like to say ah the camera pans*** ah aiyoyo you know your stuff very well you learn thoroughly  laughter and the i like that scene ah the steps leading to the the sea and ya beautiful and then ghost feeling is gone birds are flying through the place ya uhm there was a breakthrough like there was a breakthrough like eh eh and then estella and him met again ya but that part when he says erm when when something about understanding each other at the end when they were talking to each other what is that it was like love like love first at first sight mm uhm say that uh like the like estella say that can you ever forgive me say that { don't you understand me { orhh then they look at each other without saying a single thing and the narrator say that she understood all along so in just very few words we get the idea it conveys the message that actually their love is so strong that it can cross class boundaries class boundaries uh years uhm yes ya many years many many years ya ya more than 10 years more than 10 ya at first i felt a bit sad because urm how come estella always promises to be there and then you know she didn't turn up you know yeah she never turn up for example the opening of his show his you know his paintings she said i'll be there and yet she wasn't there ya it was like the revenge loh orh remember uh 'stella's grandmother uhm uh forsaken at the altar the guy never turned up so it is the same thing here uhm art gallery supposed to be there it's a fulfilment of his dreams everything that he ever wanted but he wasn't { she wasn't there { she wasn't there uhm ya right it was like the ultimate revenge lah i see and instead she got married right ya that's worse right to a guy whom we can { tell she doesn't really love ya so sickening ya i like the part when give me your hand and he put the put it on the heart and say what is what is that he said wah and first thing as a small boy he said it was the boobs  laughter  ya when he was a small boy and everyone touches estella's auntie's heart so scared boobs lah boobs laughter estella says it's my heart sure and it's broken and it went full circle again ah ya ya and she realises how much it hurts and she i think she was quite regretful also uhm for what she has done to him the aunt the aunt ya that's why she knows how what it feels ya to be the other side 'cause ya ya ya loh and he she said i'm sorry ya ya that was quite touching so all along it was her doing uhm uhm quite interesting show lah not bad talking about it is fun lah ya hor uhm but so few people lah maybe because it has been running for quite some time lah actually two weeks only leh two weeks only hor two weels only so sad but ya especially the music lah i think very nice music really good uhm very nice music ya censored lah hor sad laughter  but it's okay still quite complete in its ways makes you want to read the book hmmm maybe one day i'd try i may try is it difficult to read uh ya { a lot of details a lot of details { not really not really orr i read some of his stuff not bad ah charles dickens i read christmas carol that was that was cute not too bad so i think can understand it's quite good lah it's quite good because it it brings out the the deep feelings ya of uh love revenge wah estella's auntie is real mad  laughter  ya that was very nice portrayed like what right it's like what the book described you know uhm sometimes she'd just wear the wedding dress again ta very crazy very crazy ya but she always act this kind of role one lah is it who is it her name is anne bancroft uh orh always act crazy is it ah old lady patriarch-type lady uh very eccentric orh ya  laughter  he she acted in a role something like that and won won best supporting actress before orh orh years ago this show called the graduate orh the graduate orh she's the one ahh she was the ya the old lady okay the old lady kind of the old lady kind of thing uhm
