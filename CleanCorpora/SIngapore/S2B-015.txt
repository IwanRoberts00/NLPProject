""
""
some exciting displays are being planned for the singapore
armed forces military tattoo
""
""
it's a three-day event that starts on the twenty-ninth of
next month
""
""
and it promises to have just hair-raising stunts
""
""
ever wondered how it feels to jump off a thirty-metre tower
""
that's exactly what the commandos will be doing during the
nineteen-minute military tattoo
""
each of them will be doing a free-fall repelling from these light
towers with coloured smoke coming out of their helmets
""
they'll dive straight from the top without a parachute and only a
rope to hold on to
""
""
the main difficulty besides the height is the wind because
being up so high the wind is pretty strong and this will affect the repellers
when they're descending
""
so they have to uh spread out their bodies to stabilize themselves
so as to come down uh in a in in a steady manner
""
so that's one factor but uh with constant practice they should be
able to overcome overcome this
""
""
and what are some of the safety measures being taken
""
""
to start with he has his safety helmet his safety goggles
""
now of course he has to put on a pair of leather gloves
""
these are the standard repelling gloves which he use protects his
hands from getting burned and gives him better grip on the rope
""
then he has his uh harness which he sits into to which it's
attached a carabina and this device which is called figure-of-eight
descender
""
this is quite an important safety device because first of all it
aids him to in doing his braking
""
so when he brakes the figure-of-eight the way it's configured slows
down the descent and stops descent completely
""
meanwhile when he's descending freely this figure-of-eight
descender enables the rope to glide freely to give him a smooth descent
""
and that's just one of the highlights of the tattoo
""
if you're interested to go tickets will be on sale from tomorrow at

by september
""
""
dancers actors artists and sculptors where they're just
starting out or established will soon share a common home at armenian street

""
three local artists have pitched into help raise more money for the
substation
""
they donated some of their prize/price towards like this one
""
it's in front of the lama monastery by ong kim seng
""
with help like this the centre can better serve the arts group here

disciplines can interact

and cultural barriers

a computer system to give students more hands-on experience in
automated engineering
""
launched today by the ngee ann polytechnic the facility cadcam fms
is one of the largest installations used for teaching
""
""
the five-million dollar system was officially opened by the
chairman of the national computer board mr tan chin nam
""
a tour of the facility also gave mr tan a first-hand look at the
fully automated flexible manufacturing system or fms
""
the computer installation is the first of its kind to using fms for
teaching
""
it reflects the present trend in automated manufacturing and it has
two main advantages the fms allows for frequent changes in product design and
demand
""
for the polytechnic the end of the project is by no means the end
of its partnership with ibm singapore the company which was awarded the
project
""
the two are looking into providing training to develop the system
further the polytechnic also hopes to work with ibm to provide consultancy
services to manufacturing firms here
""
and as for students new system spells a brighter future
""
""
we hope that uh with such instrument given to our students
thereby they will be able to make use of the cadcam facilities as well as the
fms
""
the flexible manufacturing system will be able to assist the local
industries as well as any other industries to automate themselves
""
""
and just a week away the military tattoo to celebrate the saf
silver jubilee
""
those involved in the show are fine-tuning their acts
""
""
stamina fitness strength and teamwork
""
this act calls for the same qualities the saf's been instilling in
them
""
three hundred and twenty men from four units will give you a taste
of sheer brute and entertainment
""
what's needed is some fine-tuning like being in step with everyone
and being confident of the pyramid
""
the high point is this five-tier human pyramid
""
it's collapsed many times and will continue to be the biggest
worry but confidence grows with every practice
""
another peep into the army will come from this man-handling of a
twenty-five pounders
""
the first guns acquired by the saf are now used for ceremonial
purposes
""

this month the pa youth movement organized several activities
to bring its a hundred thousand members together
""
it's all part of youth month their tribute to the nation it was
also a chance to see how the movement crew grew sorry from forty to a hundred
thousand members today
""
""
pulau ubin and its wooden rural community centre reminds
youth pioneer of koh kok weng of the cc he started in jalan besar sixteen
years ago
""
""
at the beginning when we started organize activities for
youth it was really an uphill task
""
first of all the condition there is not really conducive as
there's no attraction and most of the youth do not know the existence of the
pa youth movement
""
so we got to launch an house-to-house campaign to publicize the
youth movement so they come to know about it
""
""
and to keep them coming the popular activities of that time
were introduced
""
activities like weight-lifting sepak takraw and table tennis which
are still popular today
""
but with more members joining the movement in the late seventies
and early eighties there was a need to offer more varied activities and the
late eighties saw social service getting more important
""
as a sense of community grew the youth members learned to how
identify social problems and even solve them
""
in the future youth leaders will also be meeting and mixing with
youth leaders from other countries more often to exchange ideas and to learn
from each other
""
but the sea's where the action will be
""
more and more of the adventurous and independent youths of today
are expected to go into sea sports and perhaps even more will try to put
singapore in the map like these canoists
""
they'll try to break the present record by forming a raft with
three hundred and fifty canoes this sunday
