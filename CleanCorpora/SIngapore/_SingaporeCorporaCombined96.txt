his name is ken oh ken what ya like i don't think it's ken tong oh whoever word will say ken tong ya lah ah don't be silly uh ya anyway so he was like talking about work and all and he was not doing his work he was reading up books on japan oh so i was like ah even i can tell that you're not doing work but he's nice lah uhm ya lah he looks quite okay he's marianne's colleague uh uhm uhm ya don't know in what capacity i think we must really ask marianne word  oh oh ya what's she doing uh her her job sounds like fun you know research uh oh uhm actually she's i think like secretarial or administrative support to to her boss lah ya what what's what what is it doing are they a research group or what uhm oh andersen consulting does uh these you see they have clients uhm uhm and the clients ask them to do computer packages for them or uhm training sessions and stuff like that uhm uhm uhm uhm so they have to present proposals and all lah so he will i think provides uhm support lah administrative support uhm uhm uhm ya like uh maybe when they need certain things then she like when they need you know information on stuff like this she'll come down and get it oh so fun so ya so the main actually the main bulk of the work is done by con the consultants oh  word consultants they pay them quite a lot so i i hope will will get to be one lah ya i hope i hope ya so actually ya so she said see how lah so consultants are the ones who actually do up the proposal you see uhm and you know get the information and write up the stuff so i think for her she just you know provides support lah so she does the running about and gathering the information lah uhm i don't know about the running about this is the first time i've heard her coming here to get information ya ah i think probably the consultants have to do it themselves uh eh so fun uh i hope one day she become a consultant ya i hope so too anyway ya it sounds pretty interesting why don't you go into that too ya i can do research but then how uh maybe they want things like accounting and and management no i don't think so they take in they they take in ba people as well how lang lang lang also ya i think so ya eh then maybe i can ask her ya ya ask if there's vacancy and you know just write in your resume and then or or if there's vacancy suh  word itself ya and then ask them lor uhm uhm uhm i think should be quite fun uh ya should should be quite fun and they pay quite well so and that's only for an ordinary degree so if you've got a masters i think that will be worth something ya maybe maybe i could  word  so so how did you go to the you're going to the cash-on-line right oh no i didn't go ya i thought you i forgot all about it because she didn't bring her tickets what oh yes yes so do you want to go or not you don't want to go phantom of the opera no lah i i really want to go but you know i word  that's no problem not liquid at all lah  laughs  totally not liquid lah i'm so sorry aiyah eh i'm so sorry you know we forgot to ask my sister about what about the ribbon the ribbon oh no it's okay anyway we met marianne so that's okay uhm ya i wanted to ask you also about your your sister whether ya we spoke with her after she met jokim and how she feels and stuff like that ya ya ya so so okay she called me lah ah and then she just like okay she she she she likes jokim because she can talk to jokim and everything lah uhm then i said like so how's how how do how do you like the hairstyling you know very good uhm she's very impressed but then i think like make-up she was like i don't know what she was looking for lah but actually like i mean what do you expect like miracles uh i mean what do you expect like like those tsk you know those artists uh those paris make-up artists uh like super-models uh ya those models uh ya ya i well i don't think the the photos do a lot of justice to the make-up lah but uhm i think it's also very important to remember who who the models are you see i mean because they are like normal you know ordinary people ya ordinary people you see so it's not like i mean not exactly like your ah lian ah hui that sort lah but you know ya but ya ya so and sometimes you can't expect miracles really i mean of course you want to look good you know but uhm ya and then some of these people may not be photogenic ya that's right you know so it doesn't come off and you you don't have all those touch-ups and photography ya ah tell your sis if she wants uh ya she can come over to my place uhm and have a look at my dayspring album ya ya ya okay ah because uh then you know to see if she wants before if she wants uh that sort of photographs before she signs up lah otherwise uhm uhm uhm you know if it's not to her expectation then you know seven hundred and ninety dollars is a lot of money to spend for that ya then she can also see the make-up i i really like dayspring's uhm make-up artist did really catherine uhm no no that one is uh lancome that one is separate that one i got for the day orh but uh the studio one because mine was a whole package and nuh it was together with studio make-up as well eh uh uh uh so the lady did it very nicely i was like whoa can't even recognise myself uhm ya ya i saw i saw  word turned out i think the photos turned out quite quite good lah ya ya so uhm ya if she wants to you can ask her lah word in fact i think i think your photos you look very good in your photographs ya i mean in the studio photo i take uh huh yes yes yes yes not like myself like that so like whoa okay ya enhanced lah enhanced lah remember word  ya but hans oh oh enhanced enhanced hans like ya hans like goldfish eyes he can't get over it so like so sad because he's really the photogenic one you know i'm the one who's not so i say oh you got no problem lah you know so when the photos turned out it's like why am i like staring like that so i've to find excuses you know no lah maybe sleepy that day no maybe headache lah maybe he should have looked into a flower word  looking ya he's word disappointed but i mean i still think he looks good ya because he's really very photogenic when you take him un unawares uh ya he comes out very nicely uhm uhm for some reason or other ya that's why i told you lah when i pin up his hair quite good some some people it it's it's like this you know whether the camera likes you or not ya ya some it's like turns out really good and also i think it depends on the photographer's skill and the kind of background uhm like uhm there was once i i wore this red dress uhm uhm uhm uhm to go to this friend's wedding so she took photographer like uhm i looked normal lah you know goggy uhm and all that when i went to take then the same day that afternoon uhm uhm i went to take uhm a passport photograph and uhm my ic photo  word  ya ya oh ya you're telling me very nice ya then like ya quite good so i thought ya i suppose it depends on who's taking it as well as ya the kind of uhm background that you have then ya lah a lot of factors ya whether it's outside indoors or outdoors so all that burn must bear in mind lah ya i mean she can look really wonderful for studio and she may look really wonderful on that day but the photos may not turn out that well you see ya i think so you know that's true ya so just tell her to be realistic and wake up you know ya lah that that's it like she must she must do her research all lah ya i guess she's a because she's not so too keen on on jokim no she she she wants she she's gonna ya she she's not too like wow about his make-up but she she's going to take him on and oh she's going to take him on nuh if if since he agrees to take her on so okay lor uh okay fine like jo quite funny uh like he just decides okay six hundred dollars maybe he's been calculating you know in his mind ya no actu i i don't know lah i think based on what i know of jo he will like look at you and and the person and he thinks that he can afford it he can work with you and ya i mean word  your budget lah uh and then of and then he will like talk to you and then if he thinks he likes working with you then okay you know he doesn't mind the money is not that important ah but let's say if you know he doesn't really like you very much uh and he thinks you're very calculative and all that sort of thing uh he doesn't really click with you then i don't think he will give you the the discount oh i think that's how he works i mean i i haven't told him this lah but i've been observing him you see aah so but he's mighty generous ya he's he's quite fun lah i mean he will do do that for the sake of friendship or for the sake of you know ya ya of feelings lah you know you qing that type of thing orh ya yau qeng because ya ya oh because like ya when he when i first met him i thought like he like quite business-like i thought ya but then later on he like kind of warmed up lah ya and became himself and showed us his topper i like was very shocked like he really went to the room and take out stuff and like showed us like eh ya ya i like word oh maybe theresa and him are in and all right ya like maybe like you know very good friends ya mean like he's never done that lah normally we are quite sane i mean how long ya quite good friends you know i think you all share a lot right must be on christian stuff uh ah ya i mean we just we just talk lah you know and he's like quite strange because there are some things that he knows and there are some things that he doesn't know like siblings he thought was like you know sons and daughters  that's children  word sisters ya he's so cute or something like that lah you know ah like when you say psychosomatic word uh like what you know but i i like that about him because he's very frank you know and he doesn't like uhm ya put on airs word  ya un unpretentious lah ya he's quite unpretentious so ya that that's why it's fun and i always enjoy my my sessions with him even like now when i call him i'm quite scared because it's like what you feel you know like he's a bit stand-offish ya even when i call him it's like uh jo i want to cut my hair then he like uhm okay let me see and then he like we never joke and we never like talk properly over the phone you know ya ya it's just like a business transaction then uh when i  word  that was how my sis ya ya ya it's only when i see him then okay you know i will like oh talk to him lah then he'll be okay ya so he's that sort lah because word like oh hello then wasn't like very friendly sort ya ya like oh no he doesn't warm up to you word  ya he doesn't then i like oh no maybe i was rude somewhere i like ya i know i feel that all the time huh it's like maybe i was imposing on him or like sometimes when i go down at five minutes late or whatever it's like i feel so terrible you know ya then like oh nev' mind it's okay okay i mean then he started  word / sounded word so so you know like discouragingly and ya so like i feel like maybe ya maybe i've offended him maybe he is angry ya maybe he is he is angry ya exactly you see but after that he'll be okay
