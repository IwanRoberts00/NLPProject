your honour i have put up briefly written submissions based on the main issues adduced in this trial and i will go according to the subject matter accordingly your honour the first issue is what is the nature of the contract what is in fact the contractual subject matter your honour the solution to this issue has to be found in the contract dated tenth september nineteen eighty-three which is evidence in exhibit one and two of the agreed bundle your honour it is very pertinent to note that these contract was drafted by the defendant company and not by the plaintiff's company it is only countersigned by the plaintiff's company at the end of the contract at page two your honour i submit that the subject matter of contract evidence by this letter from the defendant company was for the defendant to supply approximately eight thousand tons of p w d b one asphalt premix to the plaintiff's project at yio chu kang road hereafter i will just refer to the project your honour it was not a contract to supply all the asphalt premix which was required by the project your honour my inference is based on the following points the parties contemplated that the defendants will supply and lay approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix to the project at sixty-six dollars your honour the meaning of the word approximately means about or more or less and this is this meaning has in fact been given by the candidate court of appeal case in british wheat carbassing company limited versus e d eddie company limited reported in nineteen twenty-one fifty-nine normally law report page seventy-seven which can be found in the plaintiff's bundle of authorities at page twenty-three to twenty-eight if your honour would refer to the plaintiff's bundle of authorities to this particular case at page twenty-three which i submit that this case has some relevance to our case in point your honour this is before the supreme court of canada and in this case the facts are stated in the headnote an agreement for the sale and purchase of paper contained the following clause one hundred and fifty tons approximately of paper per year and it was held your honour the court held that on the proper construction of these clause that the contract was for the sale of one hundred and fifty tons of paper per year the word approximately was only to provide against incidental variations arising from slight and unimportant excessors or deficiency and that each year must stand by itself the contract not being for four hundred and fifty tons during a three year period the words being the whole of the purchase requirements did not form any controlling part of the contract and were merely an intimation as to the purchaser's requirements your honour i quoted this case merely to show you the meaning of the word approximately it doesn't much go much further than that here the contract will sell approximately one hundred and fifty tons of paper per year and that instead supplied short of it and i think the issue before the court is revolves the word around the word approximately and it was held that we have to give incidental deficiencies and surpluses to that figure so in our case the figure eight thousand tons was provided for and therefore the actual tonnage supplied by the defendant company was seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-five point ninety one tons which is only three point three per cent short and therefore the word approximately would cover the shortfall of three point three per cent may i carry on your honour next the caption re-surfacing of road at yio chu kang road in the said contract at page one your honour if you look at the caption it merely says servicing of road at yio chu kang road it is submitted that this caption was used conveniently to facilitate easy reference in the exchange of correspondence between the parties the caption did not specified the exact points between which the defendants were to lay the asphalt premix the plaintiff's contract with p w d in contrast and as pleaded in paragraph one of the statement of claim and admitted by the defendants was to construct and widen yio chu kang road second carriage way from sembawang hills to jalan kayu p w d's contract was very specific from which points of yio chu kang road to which point the contract made between the plaintiff's company and the defendant's company never mention the exact points between which asphalt premix had to be laid next your honour clause three of the contract at page one thereof it says that please note that we are not responsible for the variation in thickness laid as our quotation quoted to you is on metric weight only your honour i submit that the word our quotation must referred to the quotation as evidence in this contract and the quotation is an offer to supply approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix there cannot be any other things besides this which is so clearly provided for in clause two this is reinforced by the word metric weight only and metric weight your honour i submit must refer to the eight thousand tons metric tons of asphalt premix referred in clause two therefore clause three obviously show the intention of the writer that this quotation is an offer to the plaintiff's company to lay to supply and lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of asphalt premix at sixty-six dollars any other construction would make this contract redundant in a sense that if it is to lay the whole of the project then there is no need to mention a quantity in the asphalt premix to be supplied your honour it is also given by p w one witness f w one in this trial that it is customary unusual for contracts of this nature to always bear a limit on the tonnage to be laid next your honour the defendant's statements of supply as shown in the agreed bundle and for most of them they have printed words like site and tons and even have column for quantity supplied tons and balance to be supplied tons these words are not put there for fun they must have served a purpose this is basically to show or it would indicate to the defending company when they have breached the approximate limit if indeed the contention is that it was for the defendant to supply the whole of the asphalt premix then there is no necessity when they are laying the premix in stages to keep track of the tonnage laid it's not necessary in fact they should have just add up the total towards the end of the whole project and say oh this is ten thousand tons and twelve i submit your honour that all these clauses and words used in this contract point to the fact that the parties contemplated at page three of my submissions your honour paragraph h contemplated a quantitative definition of the subject matter of the said contract and this subject matter was uppermost in the minds of the contracting parties when they make the contract and it was definitely not an open-ended contract where no quantity or tonnage is specified the subject matter to be gleaned from all these wordings and from the evidence and testimony in this court in totality re-enforces the plaintiff's version that this contract was a simple one it was for the defendant company supply of approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix at sixty-six thousand dollars and not for the defendant to supply the whole of the asphalt premix requirement for the project your honour it is also pertinent to note that the total tonnage laid for the whole project by the defendants and resources development corporation total up to nine thousand eight hundred and forty-four point fourteen tons and in percentage terms it is twenty-three per cent more than the estimated eight thousand tons stipulated in the said contract your honour p w one witness p w one had been in the road construction business since nineteen sixty-two and is unlikely given his experience and expertise to under provide twenty-three per cent of asphalt premix required by the project therefore p w d's testimony that he estimated eight thousand of asphalt premix for part of the project from ang mo kio avenue four to yio chu kang track fourteen is credible d w one and d w three corroborated p w one that a figure of eight thousand tons of premix originated from the plaintiffs on this first point your honour i submit this conclusion that the defendants had supplied seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-five point ninety-one tons of asphalt premix to the project it had been permitted to perform its obligation to supply approximately eight thousand tons the shortfall of two hundred and sixty-four point zero nine tons or three point three per cent of the estimated eight thousand tons is small given the nature of this type of contract and the circumstances of this case and the de minimis rule should apply to absolve the plaintiff from being liable for this shortfall if i may proceed your honour i will go on to the next point on the cannons of construction of written contracts in the case of clear and unambiguous contract your honour i submit that the contract was clear unequivocal and free from ambiguity the words used therein are to be construed in their plain ordinary and popular sense clauses one and two of the contract and three in their plain and ordinary meanings can only be interpreted to mean that the defendants were to supply deliver and lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of asphalt premix at sixty-six dollars per ton clauses one and two and three i may add are not susceptible of any other interpretation the defendant's contention that they were entitled under the said contract to supply all the asphalt premix required by the project contradicts or varies clauses one two and three of the contract and where the words of a written agreement have a clear and fixed meaning extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show that the parties meant something different from what have written  ninety-four  section ninety-four of the evidence act precludes the admissibility of the testimony of d w one and d w three which seeks to show that the parties meant something different from what have been written in the contract your honour the next point is this the defendants drafted the contract which was countersigned by the plaintiffs the rule of construction is that a deed or other instrument shall be construed more strongly against the grantor or maker thereof the contra proferentum rule is best summarized by in a case of john lee and son versus rail executive and i quote a passage of abasad master of the roll we are presented with two alternative readings of this document and the reading which should be adopted is to be determined among other things by a consideration of the fact that the defendants put forward the documents they have put forward a clause which is by no means free from obscurity and have contented that it has a remarkably if not extravagantly wide scope and i think that the rule contra proferentum should apply as in our case your honour this is a typical case of a written contract where the defendant company is seeking to expand the scope of the contractual matter so extravagantly and i would urge your honour to apply the contra proferentum rule against the defendant i do not admit that this contract is ambiguous and capable of two interpretations but indeed it is then i submit that the contra proferentum rule should be used against the defendant who was the drafter of the contract
