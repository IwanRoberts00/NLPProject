mr pro-chancellor graduates ladies and gentlemen
""
my very first words and indeed all my words from here on are for the
graduates for whom we're all gathered here this afternoon
""
congratulations
""
i will not repeat what others might have declared from this rostrum
on occasions like this
""
namely that i wish i were in your place to start all over again
""
kknowing as i do now the pitfalls to avoid and the opportunities to
seize
""
no errors teach and enrich
""
and although you must think ahead and plan your career never grieve
over a wrong turn in your path or despair if it takes a little longer to find
your vocation
""
but while i have no wish to begin afresh i'm still filled with envy
as i look at you all
""
the hopes the ambitions and the confidence that is written on your
beautifully unlined faces
""
the many years you have ahead of you and on top of it all literally
on top of it all those luxuriant mops of hair
""
i'm consumed with jealousy
""
having accepted the invitation to address this convocation i was
pleased to learn that my audience would be composed mainly of graduates in
the sciences and mathematics
""
people of like discipline and disposition as i with whom i can
readily empathise
""
surely i said to myself with more than 20 years of working
experience there was much i could say that would benefit those about to leave
academia
""
so three weeks ago i sat down to prepare my speech determined to
pass on the fruit of my years of accumulated wisdom
""
to my utter disgust and frustration i discovered i had little to
say apart from the usual platitudes
""
that was humiliating because doesn't that mean my post-graduation
years have been uneventful and unenlightening containing little of note
""
fortunately for my self-esteem the answer is no
""
what it does mean is that there exists no easy principles that
apply universally to everyone
""
regardless of personality time and circumstance
""
therein lies the difference between the friendly academic cloisters
that you've been accustomed to and the realistic theatre of life
""
my message to you today is that there is no message
""
in real life there are no pat answers that assure you of a passing
grade
""
in physics at least in undergraduate physics you adopt a model of
the universe
""
and on the basis of this fixed model develop your theories
""
make your observations and draw your conclusions
""
in mathematics you work from a given set of postulates from which
you derive theorems through aristotelian logic
""
until you change your model or your postulates you live in a
comfortable world of orderliness and predictability
""
all that will change as you step out of these hallowed halls of
learning into the turbulent climate of commerce and industry
""
and yes even the civil service
""
out there nothing's axiomatic and you play by an uncertain calculus
that changes as you move from one job to another between one boss and the
next
""
intimidating
""
enough to make you stay in the university a few more years doing
post-graduate studies
""
not necessarily
""
while most if not all of you will have little use hereafter for
non-euclidean geometry and the abstruse equations of theoretical physics
""
and while the same is true for much of the examinable syllabus of
the science faculty
""
all is not lost or wasted
""
the ability to analyse to draw logical conclusions from observed
facts and agreed assumptions
""
and above all the acquired confidence to absorb unfamiliar facts
and learn new theories will put you in good stead in any enterprise
""
even marital ones i found
""
one word of warning
""
any acquired skill unless regularly practised atrophies
""
the ability to learn is no different
""
and the intellect unless it is sharpened through constant exertion
dulls
""
if i have only one piece of advice to give to the young graduate it
is that he must never cease to learn
""
he must be relentless in his quest for new knowledge and a better
understanding of his surroundings
""
and he must apply to this endeavour no less rigor that is demanded
by the disciplines of mathematics and the physical sciences
""
but logic isn't the alpha and omega the be all and end all
""
logic and the power of analysis are necessary conditions for modern
living but they are far from sufficient
""
rational thinking i'm told occurs in the left half of the brain
which is better at functioning in a sequential manner
""
the right half tends to operate in a simultaneous fashion much like
parallel processing in computers
""
image recognition aesthetic appreciation and intuition are governed
by the right
""
neither hemisphere is fundamentally more dominant than the other
""
and which half is used more often depends on the type of functions
that are emphasised
""
given the obsession of our society with science and technology and
your kind of training in an examination-oriented system
""
that leaves little time for mental exploration beyond the syllabus
""
i'll be surprised if with few exceptions the right halves of your
brains have got enough exercise
""
this is a pity because good performance at examinations should not
be achieved at the expense of creativity
""
don't knock intuition or gut-feel as the americans call it
""
when newton saw the apple fall and archimedes screamed 'eureka' as
he jumped out of his grecian tub
""
it was the right halves of their brains that flashed
""
subsequently of course the left halves had to be put to work to
construct more precisely the laws of gravity and floatation but only
subsequently
""
these stories are apocryphal but not so those of kekule who grasped
the shape of the benzene molecule while day-dreaming in front of the fire
""
and coleridge who composed kubla khan in his sleep
""
coleridge of course was no scientist and neither was mr raymond
chow the movie producer who made bruce lee famous
""
mr chow told me he did not call for sophisticated business analysis
to convince him that ninja turtles would make money
""
indeed rational arguments would probably have deterred him from his
investment
""
after all who wants to watch slimy green turtles emerging from
sewers
""
as it turned out millions do and mr chow is so much richer because
he respected his gut-feel
""
the founder of ibm thomas j watson was famous among other things
for the sign in his office which read 'think'
""
he should have added with both hemispheres'
""
a proper balance between the cerebral hemispheres is necessary
""
just as the totally irrational person hobbles along on mental
crutches a liability to himself and others
""
the clinically rational person who distrusts intuition inflicts
upon himself an unnecessary handicap and misses a lot of fun
""
rational thinking must allow for occasional diversions into random
unstructured reverie to discover and create
""
while intuitive insight must be complemented by logical arguments
which perform form and structure for it to be communicated
""
can i be so bold as to suggest that the truly educated person is
one in whom the two halves of the brain function in synchrony
""
the truly educated person is well-balanced in thought and behaviour
""
not for him the extremes of the religious fundamentalist or the
dogmas of the ideology
""
instead he opens himself to new ideas however strange and opposing
views however unpalatable
""
i fear that the trouble with many of our newly graduated is their
total conviction on so many issues as if the text books they read and the
examinations they passed have conferred infallibility
""
self-confidence is useful particularly in the young but
overwhelming confidence can lead to prejudices and bigotry
""
we must not forget how ptolemy's geocentric universe was replaced
by keppler's heliocentric one
""
how newton had to yield to einstein and why einstein's general
relativity must eventually give way to a unified theory of physics
""
how can we be absolutely certain of anything when we must deny
what's so clearly obvious as the solidity of this rostrum before me
""
but we all know that this rostrum is mainly empty space that is
nothing
""
the wood consists of molecules the molecules of atoms and atoms are
no more than elementary particles separated by enormous amounts of space
""
are there even particles or just waves
""
as i rest my hand on this rostrum i don't know where flesh ends and
wood begins
""
even if you've never heard of heisenberg the years in university
should have instilled in you a sense of uncertainty feelings of intellectual
humility and a guarded scepticism against every new guru appearing on the
political economic or religious scene
""
remember some of the principles of duality and accept that
diametric opposites need not be mutually exclusive and annihilating
""
like wave and particle
""
relative and absolute
""
capitalism and socialism
""
monopoly and competition
""
nature and nurture
""
private enterprise and government ownership
""
hot and cold
""
yin and yang
""
left and right
""
what the university has taught you is only a start an opening to
greater discoveries
""
let me as i come to the end of my speech leave you with what so
many ancient sages have said
""
which is that the truth lies not in the stars and the vastness of
outer space but in ourselves and the ordinary things around us
""
wisdom is and here i quote my favourite lines by william blake 
""
to see the world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower
to hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour what more
can anyone of us want  
""
""
 address by mr c r rajah president singapore law society 
""
""
mr pro-chancellor graduates ladies and gentlemen
""
after six years at primary school four years of secondary two
years in pre-university three or four years at university and all the moments
of doubt
""
and even pure panic along the way here
""
you all are this morning more than five hundred graduates ready to
be well and truly convocated
""
today you receive the degree scrolls that formally proclaim your
graduatehood
""
so what is it to be a graduate
""
are you any different from who you were before
""
yes you are and i will tell you why
""
as a student there were no expectations of you other than a hope
that you would pass your exams
""
your graduation has changed all this
""
your intellectual capacity is now no longer in question and your
ability to stay the course no longer in doubt
""
you have proved yourself
""
your graduation has clothed you with a new status
""
there are now great expectations of you
""
whether you like it or not whether you deserve it or not unless
time tells otherwise
""
you are now regarded as a responsible and respectable member of
society
""
someone to whom problems may be referred to for solutions from
whom leadership will come and in whom others may trust
""
and as surely as night follows the day when others look upon you
and treat with you with new respect and regard
""
you yourself will change to grow into and accommodate the new
position your graduate status finds you in
""
this change will come faster for some than for others but for all
of you it starts with your graduation
""
will the mantle of graduatehood change you for the better
""
i hope it does
""
how do you ensure that such change will be for the better
""
i wish i knew the whole answer
""
to some of you your enhanced status might go straight to your head
""
time and your own conduct will find you out
""
others will soon have little regard for you
""
the rest of you will grow to fulfil in lesser or greater extent
all the expectations we have of you
""
but all of you in the end will have to find your own answer armed
with the principles of truth and virtue that have been instilled into you
over the years
""
and as an educated person which you should by now be you have one
great responsibility to yourself and to society
""
always to think for yourself
""
to make up your own mind
""
you have been taught to do so and trained to do so at the
university
""
continue to do so through life
""
apply your mind to a problem and find your own solutions
""
of course there is no point in re-inventing the wheel 
""
where you can get help or advice from a person with experience or
a book always do so it will save time but always make certain that you
understand the basis of the solution or advice offered in the course of your
working life whether as a lawyer scientist or whatever else you might turn
your hand to you may only be a link in the decision-making chain the final
decision or view taken may not be that which you hold be prepared to
re-examine your own views and to adjust them if you are wrong the greater the
reputation of those whose views differ from yours the more you should be
alive to the possibility that you may be wrong if not in whole perhaps in
part and if you are wrong learn from your mistakes there is nothing wrong in
an honest mistake those who have never made such mistakes cannot be prone to
holding a view or taking a position but do not make the same mistake twice if
after all your re-examination you still believe you are right then stand firm
maintain your view hold fast your position it does not matter if your view
does not prevall remember that just as you feel convinced that your view is
right there may be others who feel just as strongly that your view is wrong
and their contrary view right respect their honest views as they should
respect yours agree to differ but until you are in your own mind to your own
knowledge on your own reasoning and by your own instinct satisfied that you
are wrong you must never never abandon your own truth for that of another
maintain your intellectual honesty and integrity and the same spirit of
inquiry and reason that has carried you through the last sixteen years and
brought you here today will take you and all those who travel with you
through a life where you will always stand tall my warmest congratulations
then to each of you and to your parents guardians teachers loved ones and all
those others who have in one way or other touched your life and helped to
turn you into the flower of our youth
