so how how's the special session whoa you want me to talk about the special session that one no confi closed meeting how can i talk about special session oh closed meeting uh uh you cannot tell us about simon who will be posted to which uh uh gabriel will be here right it's confirmed uh what else you can tell us about him he's married you don't know him uh uh well i met him when i was at ttc he's married with three kids how old is he his wife is not working oh well and he is in his what uh early thirties ya early thirties he's about he's about uh shimin's age uh even though he didn't go university mai mai's age uh ya but three kids already you know very productive you know  word  i don't know how she's going to transcribe that man he called me earlier today wanting to see me because soh soon has directed him uh so poh soon was telling me only library uh only mission so he said library and other areas so i congratulated him lah but did uh your your is mary going to nominated for library again if not her who who can stand in her in her position this coming next next on twenty-third is nominations  word  but that would be up to the senior pastor to propose uh ya he will propose lah but nominations could word  agree or disagree with him but if able to disagree then i would assume that  word alternative bigger no lah my you you you are the better person to tell him what who who has been working in the library committee if you uh talk about experience i don't think you can get anyone word  so there're other people within the church uh that are that are qualified to do this job but you have old old old timers mrs basti old timers probably they have own problem uh mr mr mr what's his name uh tsk word  indonesian mr suvant uh mis mr surata surata ya uhm i'm not sure whether he can do it or not he used to right it's more than just sitting and directing people to do when you classify your books it's quite a professional job and mary is professionally trained to do that we used to have one girl remember her she was trained in library work in uk you know i heard about that and then she she got married to a church member from another church alamak we lost one potential librarian there marriage uh uh you taping this uh it's already on so how's your flat i don't know man i just received a letter from uh hdb uhm they're saying the the it's it's been approved lah the sale has been approved the sale of your flat or the one which you you're going to the sale of my flat has been approved and uh this this uh just think i i need another month's time i can get a we should get a letter to go and sign on the legal documents uh but my problem now is this old man who bought over my house he wants to come in and start planning the renovation while i'm still there old man uh days are numbered that might be create quite a problem uh because of my house now a lot of junk uhm did we've got boxes lying around then my antiques why don't you just show him the plan i don't have a plan my friend you know the plan uh you want to get a copy of the plan you got to pay you know you ask him see how much five five dollars per copy ever since i moved in ever since i ever since i moved in i never paid i never bought the plan but in this new house that i bought the owner bought a plan and gave me a copy but i thought when i got my flat they gave me free ha i i didn't pay for it i didn't buy a plan they just gave me a a plan of my flat are you sure ya nowadays you got to buy you know really uh how old is your flat about six years ah about the same time same as mine what six years exactly uh but mine all included with the sales agreement i don't think my wife paid for it i didn't pay maybe it's all in all added up into the sum you pay you don't know maybe lah maybe uh you can ask him to buy lah you pay how much can it cost not much lah search fee maybe two dollars about ten dollars uh not much lah but but it's a way of making money what ah just i just came back from hdb pastor wee ya uh just word can you come to the phone for a while uh just a minute uh is it urgent or not urgent yes okay were you around at the peter lewis seminar no i was yesterday i missed service sunday service uh uh how was the seminar i i think for the night meetings uh about two hundred plus two hundred plus uh two hundred twenty thirty i expected more uh uhm but were these people church members or outside most of them were church members but i i i i'm beginning to see uhm maybe we we need to we need to we need to strategize the publicity remember two two two years ago your missions conference was goyak no mission conference was okay two years ago remember when uh terence was organising it oh when i was still a student attendance put the record straight i was a student not working yet the attendance was terrible remember only about a few people turned up and that unless unless you push hard uh people will not come uh uh we were just talking about it last night with uh danny and uh my wife and philip uhm uhm it's it's information overkill they look up the bulletin on sunday there're too many too many things too many it's information overload the system breakdown they don't know how to prioritize uhm which one to attend which one not to attend uhm so in the end they glaze over everything and nothing seems in that's probably just one one factor i think the other point you need to see is the period in which you began your publicity long time ago you know long time when when when was long time ago i wrote a letter to all the the small group leaders you know about one and a half months ago but you you didn't have prayer meeting calling the small group leaders to pray no which we did our mission conference preparation took about a year it's just the preparation and then we have our quarterly uh mission prayer night and we made it a point to emphasize to point out this mission conference i suppose the other the other thing is how you sell how you sell the publicity uhm put the topic like that you'll deter a lot of people from coming ya ya only those who are really interested come the the the topic itself tells you what is expected uh ya spiritual movement not everybody wants word  not everybody wants discipleship too it's it scares people away the topic ya discipleship word  you can word with missions what when you organize a missions conference people interested in  word  those not interested won't come so in the but i i think on the whole those who came really benefited they were small group leaders most of them but i there were a lot more small group leaders who didn't turn up uhm somehow they word that's good ya well i i think uh uh he's a good fellow to fall back for something word conference uh talking about a bible conference sunday school word  seminar or something of that sort 'cos his exposition is quite good that's supposed to be his specialty what's his background baptist evangelical baptist yes but he preached at uh he was a good friend of martin lloyd jones really martin lloyd jones got him to preach word so did oh really so uh so his style of preaching is martin lloyd jones' uhm you read martin lloyd jones books and listen to his tapes and uh the style is about the same but i when i was sitting down talking to him i i think right now he might be coming back here quite often because he's made contacts with uh church of singapore he's made contacts with uh anglican church oh is it and i think his own church in uk is finally releasing him uhm to go on this kind of tours so if you want to you can call him again maybe family camp will be good if they talk about wesley wesley camp pointing or focused on activities this time perhaps focus on bible study word  if we have if we have a bible conference word but uh i think next year will be a different conference inviting somebody else whole flavour will change maybe we just have too many conferences that's  word  that's another possibility lah we have we have too many programs in town uh uh people have to choose so it's overload overkill ya uh don't know lah i hope i i'm i'm glad that i have finished this project so this one of your projects for this year so now i'm looking forward to moving house again uh that that will be a new project new church here not a project uh what new church here new church here what september ya lah ya lah but i i have to start working now you know on what word  got to start packing i've not even packed my clothes my things to go off uh you frequent traveller what's the problem frequent

guess minus uh i wrote to them asked them for temperature range they said will be cool for them cool is different from this cool you know cool that's relative you know ah their cool is not like uh sanyo air-con cool their cool is more like deep-freeze cool freezing man but i look forward to go lah but michigan is near the lakes right the great lakes ya word my seminary is just near the lake frozen in winter ya it'll be cold that's where scholars are made you know bring your chilli padi lah chilli padi gejok only pop one chilli padi inside sambal balachan is uh is pauline going to cook for you ya i think that's the cheapest uh don't touch the food that an american has touched do your own thing lah just buy the raw material from the farmers' market if you go to supermarket also it'll be very expensive ya when i took peter and valerie out yesterday afternoon for lunch they said that's very very something they seldom do over there  uh because for them to to eat out it's word  ten times more than cooking at home so for them after church uh it's usually  word  lunch means we take you home for lunch here lunch we take you out for lunch but if you are to uh to to eat out over there i mean if you buy and cook in then uh uh from what i heard from uh gujang who goes there quite often it's cheap uh cheaper lah cook your own food lah we have kitchenette i was told that we're going to stay in at one of the cottages the school has no dormitory uh but they have several cottages so we have to take care of the garden in winter we're supposed to shove the snow uh in spring we got to cut the grass and like that that lah and then you get paid for that no lah that's part of our roster duty man you you're staying in a community hostel uh it's a it's a it's like it's a seminary
