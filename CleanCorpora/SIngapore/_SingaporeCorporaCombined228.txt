now i had elected to speak from here uh for the simple reason that i do not have any transparencies to show now the final exam in n u s is really an institution and i think for even those of us who may not have been educated here we know that as a fact i think uh if not before then by the time you reach uh this point in the uh seminar series you have known that now the students in the days when the final exam is the only yardstick by which they are measure i think they are caught between two resignations let me explain before the exam their motto seems to be or they are rather resign to the fact that the sooner you fall behind the longer you have to catch up so they operate on that principle and indeed it's a very well uhm uh established principle because from july anywhere from july until uhm february you have a lot of time to catch up right if you fall behind soon enough and after the exam they are resign to the fact that uh and i quote from somewhere education is what's survives when what has been examined has been forgotten right because then it's too late to do anything anyway so might as well uh resign yourself to that now this uh very strange phenomena of placing the final exam as the focal point of the year and in some sense the whole uh three or four years that n u s student have uh to spend uh at this campus uh produce a really uh unique set of problems for people on both sides of the examination now i speak not as an educationist and and really i do not have uh very profound thoughts on the subject but i speak as a person who has come through the system uh mostly on the side of the staff because my my own education is largely not from n u s and uh i hope to share some of those with you now now after have the students have gone through about three of those final exams or in some cases four i'm sure many of them could almost reside the examiner's injunction from the microphone right it goes something like blah blah blah blah blah blah and and then it ends with something like expulsion from the university right and then after a while i say you may start now i think it's something like that right that's what i you call anyway and and then they bury their head right into their examination paper and they keep going now why why why do they sit through that and what are the justifications for having the exam in the group discussion that we had just now to my surprise passion do run high uh on why we had examinations and not other form of assessment uhm or rather why are no other forms of assessment use more profitably in our educational process and the discussion already word run to national objectives how we want to play in the big league and so on to philosophical issues and the technical terms that come out baffle even me you know because i'm not one of those that understand all the normatives summative word and whatever uh uh procedures that are going on examination but let me say uh in defence of the final exam since uh i have to that the common denominator principle plays a large part and i i firmly believe in it the idea is that the level the the plain field should be level because if you allow uhm the staff members to do their own assessment then we know all the problems that can come out of it i mean i come from the business administration faculty and we do have some continuous assessment components and i must confess that they are some irregularities that uh would not be so prominent in the final let me just quote a few when you have quizzes that are set and not at the same time and on the same place uh you are bound to have some problems with uhm the standards being different because you know n u s students are so well-informed they operate in a in a a market of perfect information coming from my faculty if you give an exam at two o'clock you cannot repeat the same exam at four o'clock you know otherwise they you know you most of the students will get one hundred per cent so because of that you have real problems and then of course you know in the final exam when you grade questions when you are going through the scripts you do not know who are answering the questions unless they use special kind of colour ink or something to signal to you but that is usually not the case for continuous assessment you do know except perhaps you make them quizzes uh you do know the and and uh students are not very happy about that yes you can imagine and of course uhm if you conduct quizzes as we do during tutorial groups they are actually very distinct possibility of student cheating sometimes you could almost tell that they are cheating it's just that you couldn't put quite your finger on it because you know if they are not really caught red-handed really that's the problem and in the final exam much of this is eliminated because everybody sits on a a presumably identical uh chair and they during that three hours perform and then they walk out and everybody can can see that it's quite fair or is it quite fair now let me just mention then in the next few minutes some of the problems that are real and not so much theoretical first of all we assume the examiner care about setting a good exam or even a fair exam uh what do you mean by good well we have some exposition on that issue uh during uh doctor pang's uh session and also actually in our group discussion we have to clarify for student the content expectation right i mean even that sometimes is not done very well uh from my personal experience and the fact that the final exam is actually conducted after the various uhm significant student evaluation process by that is the time and we are evaluated by students right the fact that the final exam is after that actually have some bearing on the way it's conducted i mean this again i speak from personal experience because somehow or other is like they they don't have a they don't have the final say you have the final say right okay that's one point secondly there is always the charge that uh it's not a good idea to put all the eggs in one basket and we we know all the problem with that and thirdly there is uh the mechanics of how the exam is uhm conducted now we talk about a level playing field but you know some student happen to sit below the air-conditioner and you you know i have one student who actually was near freezing this time and and you know she said that you know i was feeling so cold so i searched around in the end i just switched off that particular air-conditioner for her okay now if she didn't do well she has a good reason not to do well right and you know that students that are nearer the entrance actually might get anything up to one minute more to read the examination you all know that because it takes a long time to walk from one end of world trade centre to the other end and when collecting the papers and this is something that i raised with the registrar's office actually uh once when i was a young energetic lecturer that the the students uh many students do not honour the rule of put down your pen or stop writing now whatever the the instructor said and they keep writing because they know that nobody get penalised for it they get the a a back look i mean from the person collecting that's about it and i i feel that things can be done about it but but this is a real problem and thirdly with technology so advance today or rather lastly you have problem with calculators now the typical registrar office personnel or the typical invigilator cannot tell the difference between a calculator with only four functions and one that has one megabite of memory and at the level where i'm teaching it makes a lot of difference let me tell you that and then there is the grading system now we know uh that the examiner is under very great pressure to finish all the scripts right and uh at one time we have got six hundred and sixty student taking statistics in second year and to finish that in a short time is a not a easy thing to do and so all the concomitant problems about consistency and all that all comes in and these are real problems too ah uhm and then marks recordings can uh contain mistake in that we've seen those happening and then uh the grade adjustment is not consistent i mean there is a case uh of uhm a course having about twenty-five as in one year and the following year has over two hundred as because of some word  so let me uh then come to the last point then really the problem one of the main problem of examination as uh it is conducted in this university for for the final exam is that student have really no way of uh having any feedback from the final exam the feedback is really only one way so we talk about trying to make the examination a learning process i mean in theory it's a a good thing to be able to aim for but for many students really it's the bottleneck they all have to go through now what can be done to solve some of these problem now that would of course take another half-an-hour but i won't uh i would spare you that i think one possibility is to make it a practice a for at least for the subjects uh which are are what is term objective for the examiner to pose some kind of sketches how things should be solved immediately after the exam on the notice board because i i feel that the learning uh process is incomplete ha if a person went through three hours trying to solve some problems and they're never told what the answer was of course for certain things you can't i mean trying to comment on some shakespeare sonnets for instance i mean there is no model answer to that i could well understand but certain things the answers are clear and we must give the student a chance to look at what they are now before they forget it before they can say and i quote again educationist what survives when what has been examined has been forgotten we don't want them to say that all the time do we thank you well as you know my assignment is continuous assessment i would not have any big uh statement to make or big theorem or theory to advance uh what i want to talk about will be some problems uh connected with my own personal experience and for that purpose i think it'll be useful if i give if i say a few words about where which department i come from and so on a bit about the department i'm from the department of mathematics this department is a very big one with something like hundred and five staff members and we teach about four hundred sorry four thousand two hundred undergraduate students every year  some of our courses are huge more than six hundred students and our tutorial groups may be as big as twenty-five students involving perhaps as many as eight tutors covering forty-two tutorial groups or for the same course
