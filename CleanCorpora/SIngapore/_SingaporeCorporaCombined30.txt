this weirdo approached me you know he from afar he came and then the minute he saw me he acted as if he knew me so he came forward and asked me whether i've got a change for a dollar then i said there's a machine over there why don't you try it then he he took out his money and says uhm can you change for me so i i was so shocked lah that i did it for him and gave it to gave him the money which mrt station was this dhoby ghaut oh okay uhm but then you said before right that you've been reading a lot of these weird men weirdo ya like when i was going home from school the other day this chinese man he kept turning and looking at me then he asked me whether i was working he followed me up all the way to the mrt station same mrt station uh no not not not at word  uh and then he like i walked to the right and he followed me so i walked to the left and he followed me so i went to this very big man and stood beside him so this chinese man got scared walked away ha  word another time same mrt this man oh big man he sat opposite me so when we got out you know he started he came up to me and you know what he said or not in malay lah you know malay right uh so he says uhm ya that means aiya so cute so small so i ignored him you know walked out and then he followed still you know then he said where're you going so i said working uhm why did you answer him that's why i'm very surprised you know why you like give information uh i i i mean like where are you going going home i ignored him at first then this second time i like okay lah cos he tried so hard lah embarrassing very embarrassing so i said i'm going to school ah then he said oh studying i said no i'm working where i said where very near whoa so much of information somebody didn't just walk away you know then he said aiya so cute so small i'll see you again so i i looked oh so i say no why do you say no cos he looks married and like oh so so cheeky ya but what does this these three episodes although they may be separate what does it tell you about men in general uhm a lot of weirdoes lah not all of them are weirdoes you know no but you see from these three i mean what gives them the right to just come up and pass comments on or you know intimidate you in any way you know like like i think you you should have given it to him you know when he like oh so cute so word just like just like jerlin at him or like just don't give face just walk i did not that's why i i i think so i i mean if uhm if you were to tell me of a situation i would do i would do it lah but faced with the same with with the circumstances uh i dare not you know but do you remember uhm mary as we were coming up we we were going to clementi mrt ya then there was this guy just behind us yep and so he was so close behind us you see and we were going up the escalator so like when both of us just stand and just look at him you know he said hello you know he said hello you know he said hello no you know what made me turn he said hello uh like uh i heard a voice from like out of nowhere so i turned around then he smiled so i thought like oh maybe you you knew him but then you didn't no then we just let it go word  that's how uh ya ya then what did he do then we we just turned back lah we just turned back we just i thought you knew him uh then why why why so funny strangers could say hello to strangers do you know but he was standing very close behind us you know ya ya ya it's like not not natural you know it's not like peak hour spoonerism you know he even said hello so i thought like you knew that person and he like give a smile so like stupidly i smiled you actually smiled no like i just stand i just stand back without any any question lah wasn't like like ah like that so the moral of the story stay home uh no it's not to stay home but what is the moral of the story mary the moral of the story is that we should say hello to strange men also we should initiative no no the desirable ones don't say hi to you no ya no no no no you know what you should do you know what you should do you should just shock them you know tell anyone and do what you just shock them like how maybe you say oh hello then they say you ask for it if anything happens ya because they're always bigger than us basically admitted you have to face ya that's true that's true ya so they will like if anything happens anything bad but there were two of us what two of us and only there's one of him what although he was quite he was quite tall lah but still didn't he follow you no he didn't then we can just run and shout for help i think maybe ya cos you see i uh i i was alone so i dare not do anything funny you see no but you don't have to like give him you don't have to give him face in the first place what you could just like turn around you know what i usually do i i don't even like jerlin or anything i just like just turn around like oh a blank face you know oh i didn't see you i i i see right through you and just turn so maybe the person thought i was retarded or something or person quickly thought i didn't hear you if i just you know like so you can't say that i provoke you in any way or i didn't you know that kind of thing uhm uhh and i don't like walk very fast or anything just like pretend lah or i just see through the person like that  word  but you see this is the thing you see why should women word up with this kind of thing you know why should should a man just come up and just say oh hi sexy or hi cute i mean how come  word  what gives them the right to just come up and say pass comments and invade your privacy this is this is sexual harassment you know it is you know i kana sexual harassed again you know harassed harassed brenda harassed when when when when don't want to say the other way round uh you harass the men she she just said she kana right ya so she must be object of the harassment no lah nothing i told you about the amy thing lah uh what happened it's like i i went to the repro room reprographic room you see sorry i my english very bad i rep reprograph oh that one repro i don't know how ya reprographic word  then uhm in the photographic unit lah then i was like looking we we were doing some oh oh you told me and then he had this picture he wanna put up his picture of amy ya he had this ah that is very nice picture of chinese wayang word  whose poster is that just like oh uh your uncle's uh okay then i thought oh okay then like but if it was mine i would have given it to you then i said oh ya ya i guess that's too bad and then suddenly this this guy uninvited go and come and tell me like you know who i'll put up then i'll like have to like you know humour him that who would you put up amy yip and then like effect lost on me but he was like grinning away then i like ya okay do you know who's amy yip then i was like uh  word dozen right ya hong kong actress i was like trying to feign ignorance uh uh uh uh and then like oh okay ya smile even more but do you know what she does i said she acts and like she does more than that i thought so oh oh ya this is sexual harassment man she acts in ra movies still acts what acts what acts what still acts right okay acts what what happens if word she acts what then then then the other librarian the other librarian like aiyah chen uh you don't uh what don't don't say this kind of things uh don't talk about ra movies lah you want to talk about ra movies everyday you go to the toilet you can see one ra movie yourself i feel like kana sexual harassed twice from two men at one shot right sick or not what do you say from now onwards don't talk dirty jokes in front of me i don't want to hear don't talk sorry ya no respect ya lor that's why but that's it you see where do you draw the line you know from allowing someone to just pass a comment you know about you and where you know if it's kind of ya like uh i say some some sometimes some women like uh they like it you know they feel even flattered oh you know at least this person that bothers to look at you and say oh hi sexy something uh but i think i don't know generally my my feeling is that i i'm not flattered uhm and i just i just don't like it uhm i mean you just don't like strangers coming into i i get flustered with word whistle yes very disgusted and you find that it is men who do this you feel embarrassed you know ya of course men who do this so why can't the women do this you see women have more class you see they don't do this sort of things you know you you you talk like a psychiatrist you know no lah but it's you see i suppose if if women did it then if anything untoward happens then they always say you ask for it you uh ask for it did you watch did you watch uhm word not accused uhm uhm what's that two women they were acting that uh salmon lewis salmon lewis oh ya ya i like i i i love her i love her i love her i love word you know i love her i like both of them no i love her more uh uh who's that? ya but i don't know it's like you see let's say if you see like if just because like she she was having fun with this guy just dancing like that uh so if he want to go a step further like you know like it's as if she asked for it you know that kind of thing yeah it's just like why why is it that women can have no men can have fun anyway they want but women cannot have fun it's oh you ask for it kind of thing you know ya  it's ridiculous you know it's ridiculous uhm so how's your school my school lah okay lah very busy because exams oh finished already uh ya just yesterday i thought you were supposed to key in your grades this tuesday right that's why word  the other teachers are not as efficient as me so they have not done their work yet uhm oh so they have not passed you the grades lah ya you
