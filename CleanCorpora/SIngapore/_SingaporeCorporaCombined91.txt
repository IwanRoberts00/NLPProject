doesn't really take down messages well ah hah right ya it was well quite funny cos he said you were sleeping so i thought the voice didn't sound familiar anyway i ask is that barry then he says no it's not and i think he felt kind of awkward cos' he didn't know how what to say ya he doesn't know what to say on the phone so wait wait wait i gave up word  it was quite funny i thought ya lor i know word  i'll sleep a lot lah in the afternoon you do ah  word i get up and do work oh about six six seven plus oh dear so is this your nap time huh no lah it's okay ah i've a essay due tomorrow oh

like uh hand in assignments uhm uhm as well as um uh do my teaching practice and then it's not like you just teach from the textbook you know got to prepare lesson plan detailed lesson plan work sheets word  eeks quite artificial lah ah hah quite challenging uh that's good are you all into your practice kind of ya i'm doing the t.p. now teaching practice oh ya at that school that's near to your place right ya lah one term for one term i don't know whether to stay or not you know to stay at as in what stay stay there teach there oh cos' they actually need teachers there ah hah actually for sec one and two how do you like it there it's the usual government school lah i mean you know what i mean right it's the usual ah ya  word  so far i've been quite lucky you know i got all the good teach uh students oh that's good ya but i won't be teaching them you see if i stay on oh i actually wrote to rosie about it you know uhm about two weeks ago i wrote i think then she replied quite fast so i just got her letter i think yes ya yesterday last night uhm uhm ya she wrote to me i got hers some before chinese new year uh uhm you called her ah no no i didn't i wrote to her i think we should call her ah so terrible but do we have her new number no right ah i have one number but that was from quite long ago that's the old one nuh ya ya i don't think we have her present number come to think of it never mind lah just writing is is uh it takes long enough ya and i don't write very much lah terrible no time ya haven't written to word leh i've got about ten letters pending  laughter  yes but you've been writing to her quite a lot right that's good you know that was i thought it's six something word  last year ya it took a lot out of me ya then quite good lah i mean because she always talks about what other people are talking uh doing that's what she tells me to i think she keeps more she keeps in touch with them more than  word with me i mean you know what i mean right ya like keeping in touch with everybody else more than i do ya ya i think same place here ya so funny hor so she's feeding us all this info she knows so much about what's happening ya lor i don't know i've never been so busy before in my whole life okay this this course uh is really too much lah when is it going to end uh march march we're having exams ah hah which is quite soon nuh it means i'll finish teaching practice early next month uhm uhm then after that uh one week to study for a test for an exam ah hah then after that followed by another exam ah hah and after that we'll be posted out to schools already boy they don't give you very much time to study uh ah ya lor it's so weird lah the course because this is the first batch and then we're like the guinea pigs you know so uhm they they i think they couldn't really figure out how to what to do with us lah so word then then they cram the whole thing lah they treat us like some don't know what like that cram us with a lot of things uhm uhm and then try to make the course sound so professional and then after that you are thrown you know like no holiday no no real break lah uhm uhm except for last month i mean december uhm ya so quite pressurising lah the course oh and you're kept on your toes the whole time lah but how different is yours from the ones that the previous years right ya the previous years they take one year you know exactly and then they got holidays here and there ah hah ya then we we start immediately we don't have a holiday before we we go to school for for real you see uhm uhm ya so we start immediately lah but isn't there like the march school holidays or something like that ya lah because the following the ntu course i mean the course structure you know i mean the what do you call it cur uhm curriculum curriculum structure or whatever you call it ah hah that means it's you know like it starts oh ya the calendar it starts in jan uh ju july right uhm uhm then after that they finish in march uh very march to have exams then they have holiday until the next july right uhm ya for us it's like we start in july then we march we go out to school oh so it's like you're working round the whole year you know welcome to the working world ya quite teruk ah but at least june there's the holidays right the school holidays ya lah ah then that's not so bad lah ya lah but ya lah as usual you know things start happening nuh and then you get posted into i mean you get uh volunteered into things you know like all these uh sub-committees lah especially for young teachers oh yes yes yes ya lah then you really that's what i heard actually a lot of the teachers feel very unhappy oh all these extra duties uhm but then can't be helped what somebody has to do them and it's usually the new people who get assigned all these extra stuff right ya lor ya because they say oh you're not confirmed yet so uhm you know you better prove you know prove your ability and then the principal seems uh principal has more power than i thought ya so they can do what they want orh ya principals have quite a lot of power recently it came out in the papers didn't it something about donations and stuff oh ya lah that that one actually i ya that's very common right you have heard stories before but now it's like out in the open yes that's right but the amounts that they come to it's quite quite large ah ya i didn't expect quite so much some into the tens of thousands my goodness just to get your kid into the school maybe that's why they're losing teachers i don't know that's a lot of teacher ads recently hah on tv yes oh ya ya because it's now is the right time what soon they'll be i think they'll be putting out the ads soon uhm for ntu i mean for ie eh do you know this uhm there's this girl who did english ah her name is uh something gopal lah not sure what gopal do you know who she is no doesn't sound familiar ya she's now a hod at this school right oh hod ah of which d she's from our year you know but i think she has some uh teaching experience before that lah then she went to n uh nus to study oh ya so she's actually older than us lah i think so but i'm not very sure she looks quite young actually uhm uhm ya she remembers joan you see oh so she thinks very highly of joan then because of that she also laughter she's been treating me quite well oh that's good hod it's not too difficult to become one right ya rosie said that they have to have don't know five years working experience anyway it's a it's you know like last time you have senior assistants right uhm uhm now they don't you know and then in schools so they have these hods lah and they're not just head of department you know like humanities arts maths etcetera ah ah hah they also do all the administrative work you know oh boy ya all the admin work that's like additional work very funny huh and they give you a nice title to it lah ya lah and then you do all the other stuff rosie was offered that post wasn't she she went for the training ah hah ya then i think she's a bit too junior so if she continues for maybe another year or so i don't know oh maybe she could have got it i thought she didn't want it you know huh ya but but actually ya she didn't sound like it was very great ya that's right so it was like purposely don't do so well ya so you won't get selected type 'a' but you hear anything else from here because the letter she explain mostly replied lah to me ah hah  word  ya they went on they went on the europe tour and lost their luggage oh oh ya ya she mentioned that ya one luggage right it was stolen on the way to rome or something like that ya aiyah what a pity eh but she went around quite a bit ah uhm in europe yep  hah not bad hor that's right so fun can play with snow went skiing went skating serious ya aiyoh aiyah should have known nuh he's very active right ya
