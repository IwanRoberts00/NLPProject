i i hope to be able to to address your question i think which you know is gonna be more interesting and let's have a more interactive sort of a a discussion session uh as you can tell you know from you know from the brief introduction of my experience uh i have worked in many many different areas in terms of you know uhm functional areas but in terms of the group of customers you know that i deal with you know i find that the the smp you know or the entrepreneurs you know some of them are at least is indeed the most uh exciting and rewarding from my point of view it has also been the most frustrating you know because to deal with these people that have got enough egos that sort of you know roll all over you if they're successful can be quite a bit of a challenge just uh so i would be than happy to share with you some of my experiences just before i start off you know reading so called from my my text uh i work with a number of different people uh including people that have form a company that is for example uh s tech you might have heard of it which is a compatible to to creative technology that is a lot of my clients uh kent hurst you know the direct marketing people has another client of mine you know i have got another client that is an inventor you know that took the simple cable and decided to do something different with it you know uh and the list goes on i work with a number of different people that got some you know marvelous ideas looking at convention businesses and you know having a fresh look at how they would package things uhm so very exciting and i'm you know hopefully you know uh all that i see in front of me everyone of you are people have the spirit in you that one day and you gonna go out there and do do your thing but ladies and gentlemen to start with you recall businessman robert ng's remarks you know on the virtues on greed i'm sure at the recent pre-univeristy seminar that has sparked off much discussion and debates you know and letters in the press now i do not intend to be as provocative this evening being maybe being an accountant you know basically you know i got to be a little bit more conservative i'm here only you know to give you some ideas so you can then challenge you know amongst yourself and with me some of these ideas indeed you know this topic of entrepreneurship and what is it has generated much discussion you know in terms of you know definition not just in singapore but all over the world it has what i hope to achieve today in fact is to leave behind some ideas of what entrepreneurship is all about and who the real entrepreneurs are as you would see later on during the rest of my speech you know this concept of entrepreneurship also changes with the times you know and it will change as to how we are perceive you know entrepreneurship ten years from today will be different from what we do to uh ten years twenty years thirty years down the road now in the course of my presentation i'll be drawing from examples of real life entrepreneurs to help illustrate my point some of these people are people i know personally some are clients whom we have serve while others are personalities such as sim wong hu of creative technology michael dell of dell computers frederick smith the founder of federal express  good argument i had an argument with you know some of my staff in the office about this concept the looking at mcdonalds in singapore their introduction of the kiasu burger now is that entrepreneurship some would argue yes it's entrepreneurship because you seeing a a unique taste there you know some of the marketing programmes is it entrepreneurship yes creating demand you know it's you know in spite of using in a or fix franchise you adapt to the local market and change it and you grow additional business that is entrepreneurship as well  so i mean you can that if if you are a little adverse or if you are lacking in in in in in in for example capital to take forward an idea you can you know find you know a a company that is you know as enlightened as three m you know and be able to pursue you know even entrepreneurship within you know an organisation but certainly that's very enlightening some of these stories are very interesting uh federal express for example the way they first started they became very very successful now with it went off you know faxes voice-mail what is gonna be the next lap for them what's gonna happen to this company i'm watching i don't know what will happen to them let's see what will happen to them some of these story so nothing is forever you gotta keep changing all the time and this is what entrepreneurship is all about you know the ones with the continue sea of potential customer demand goes up there and satisfies that demand as an idea and be able to convert that idea into reality now a lot people have ideas now is that entrepreneurship just ideas how you know i've seen so many people with just ideas but some people just never convert their dream as they will forever be dreamers i've got some very bright friends mine very clever people mind you and you know every a year or so in fact about two years once they sur resurface and and i'll ask them what happen to your that last idea you know and i know you know nothing has happen and they were good ideas because you know he what's lacking is you remember the definition of entrepreneur you need the managerial capability to see through as you are just as important it's not just ideas but do you ever see through as important just as important any other questions okay i'm going to be very provocative here the people going ten years from now twenty years from now looking at two two sets you know two possibilities if i have a child that has to be in the job market twenty years from now in singapore want of the good life want a comfortable life rewarding life if you're not sure whether you're going to succeed my answer to the question be a technician be a good electrician be a good plumber be a good car mechanic you'll be in good demand isn't it don't be a graduate forget it if you're gonna be mediocre graduate forget it either that or be prepared to work overseas not in singapore so the time will come when you know must word  agree with your proposition now you want to go through the list of some these people who uh the singaporeans that at least that i know of here you note the strange thing is that the outcast in the sense you know that has succeed you know a lot of these people that have succeed they are outcast damn out and outcast i can tell you that some of these people our society have you know prejudice you know against them why because a lot of them were chinese educated they're good technicians but they went to technical school they cannot speak properly they cannot won't and can't get pass an interview you want to go and get a job with ibm they won't go pass the screening test because they can't speak proper english so they are force into the situation so they become very good technician a lot of the entrepreneurs i meet now are people like that with their technical education chinese educated they are force by circumstances to go out there they are clever people they can see it they can't express it in the lingua franca in the business environment here so they are force to go out there and make it by doing it themselves they cannot do it with anybody under the establish standards they will never make it so that's one group of them very interesting group they're a group look at these people he is only a you know technical educated he is not a full-fledge engineer to my knowledge anybody knows he's an engineer i don't think he's an engineer alfred is not you know he's very you know very impressive when he stands up to speak he'll be a salesman not i got another client the direct marketing company 'o' levels definitely not a graduate he is a doctor wong kai is so you're right by and large they are the people that are you know not graduate they're also you know force by circumstances you know to have to strike it out on their own now that's one side of looking the other side of course is you know i mean you know once you know we we we i chatted with you know this child you know in the office just now and then we i have this discussion with you know some of you know the people in my office you know the younger generation so to speak and we sort of talk about quality of life and what what you want to do in life you know and you know they came up with a very interesting proposition says well the best career you know comfortable life in singapore if you are graduate recent graduate join the army in seven years or so you'll be a major you could be very well paid there are no wars in this region you're being well-looked after it's so comfortable why should i take a risk i mean that's kind of sad you know isn't it but this is you know this are my you know we hire pretty good people in my organisation and these are the people that tell me this there some of these discussion goes on amongst you know fellow graduates so any the enlistment officer is just next door for you to sign on and say potential majors so i think you know things will change but i think it's changing because of the environment changing you know more graduates you know would have to take the risk you know because there aren't enough opportunities in singapore your bit word will grow but i think we're growing more brighter people with greater expectations you know with you know higher educational levels then you know there are jobs for offer what's the government trying to say now civil service head count they're holding head counts right if they're holding head counts they will tell you operation base is going to increase so the civil service will continue to take in the bright but only the very very brightest will get in head counts are not going to increase significantly private sector domestic business in singapore how far more can we go we're already maturing four we'll have to settle down to about four to five per cent growth and we would be very lucky over the next maybe you know twenty years or so where does it present all these bright young people that are coming onto the market place you got to be entrepreneurial or be prepared to work elsewhere so circumstances will change ice-sin:s2a-042#> disagree with me please  comment and question  i've given you my views let's have some other views here i mean i will be more than happy to to encourage you all  comment  good point a very good point i mean you know i'm just to relay you know one of my partners spoke at the you know the last you know gathering here  steven phang came by and after his speech apparently some of this you know students approach him and one student came by with exactly the same problem you know where do you slot you know an idea into and this student said that i want to bring in bungee jumping you know i don't know who to approach
