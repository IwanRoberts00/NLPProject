well maybe you can tell me whether you'll stay in teaching for your whole life i think i will why maybe not for whole life but maybe for the after three five years later then i will go for masters oh you intend to go for masters actually i am saving up more for masters oh that is nice beginning to that's why always half of my bursary all gone to savings masters in education is it yah or master in arts i don't know lah but this is my own plans you see but i don't whether is it god's will for me to do it or not have you been praying about it have been praying lah now and my mum was telling me said if i next three four years anything may happen you see what happen if i meet a man and i get married and this and that then i don't want to study anymore i mean you know tentative plans lah as least word some preparation i don't know yet you me ah if the door is open i will like to go into either youth work or prison ministry in the long-run serious so teaching is something like a stepping stone oh preparation lah in a way because it affords me a lot of opportunities to talk to youngsters see how they behave yah so unless there is a ministry in teaching itself that keeps me there then i will stay yah but i do hope that the lord will call me either prisons or delinquents ministry so actually now i mean uh by attending this course is just like uh i mean you want to get formal training is it you want to get some kind of formal training i guess not really formal training but it's more like on the job training anyway teaching is something that i like and i have lots and lots of opportunities to mix around with young people and in itself it is a ministry you see because you can change lives you can influence the kids yah that is right if the lord calls me somewhere else then this will be a very good preparation i hope to be able to do that yah i think that word sounds interesting but it is very it is not easy it will be very tough it is very tough can be quite tough you know that is why must pray a lot yah i mean spiritually you must build up also you must build up your spiritual life also hopefully my future spouse is someone who has the same vision yah otherwise it can never come true last just last june i attended this my church camp then we had this speaker called uhm this african speaker missionary daniel ungamore or whatever his name is yah then uhm we are attending the camp then he prophesied you see then he called me out you know i was so sacred because he's a very aggressive speaker called me out then he then he said uh what uhm about this mine i'm going to uhm china no he didn't say he prophesied that you are going to china yes he didn't say i'm going to china he just said that uhm you will be going to your grandfather's land and my grandfather happened to come from china yes you see and he said uhm and then you you'd be going to uhm hong kong first from there you will be going to canton or whatever is i can't remember what is it and then uhm and you will minister to the young students there and if you are faithful okay then you will uh minister to the ladies the young ladies oh yah especially my ministry that is very specific prophecy yah very specific then i was i was quite shocked because he he doesn't know me you see and how did he call you out he just points he just point at me and then i just stand up and i i was very nervous then then he said i got a i i i'm big but i got a small heart then got fears word because i never never never consider missionary work before never so it was like a big step for me and then it happens that one of my good friend my very good friend he is now in china doing mission work work work for six months it is like then a lot of my friends said it's like john the baptist you know not exactly but preparing the way for me making contact esta establishing contacts for me but i think work missionary work in china is not easy i know and i am a very fussy person especially the cleanliness i don't know how i'm going to survive well the lord will prepare when he calls that's right actually prison ministry for me won't be easy also because i'm i'm not firm enough you see sometime i get too soft with the people then get pushed around that is not really advisable maybe that is why i have to learn how to teach first you are very acceptive uhm to be teaching but is teaching your first choice actually uh uhm i was considering journalism journal that is nice but what make you change your mind i mean that that was after j c then uhm amazingly lah the lord just showed showed me which direction he wanted me to go yah then i just come into teaching actually i never considered teaching before for my whole all the while was to be a journalist you know or a reporter you know that kind of thing because i like to write you see yah that is interesting then after that yah lor teaching i actually hated teaching you know initially like when my sister went into teaching because my father wanted one of us to be a teacher so when my sister became a teacher i was telling myself whew i don't have to be one yah so i went into law i wanted to do law because it is kind of closely connected to prisons you see but i realise it's not you never really get to establish close contacts with the prisoners it is very much like a client and some stern relationship so later on i went uhm i did a bit of relief teaching then i liked it very much and i realise that my inclination is actually towards youth yah so i started praying about it and miraculously god has been opening doors you see yah like initially i was offered p g d e primary programme and i knew that i didn't want it so i rejected them and i know that if i reject them there will be a kind of record yah so they may not accept me again on the second application so when the second application came out i applied again and then notwithstanding the fact that they told us that those who have been rejected or have been offered a place don't have to apply again they will not consider us you see so i was kind of troubled i prayed about it and i wrote the letter i i wrote the application and i wrote a cover letter for the application and it's really miraculous how i was given this this opportunity to come in here and i was wagged upside down during the interview you know what did they for rejecting them oh you mean they ask you oh they ask me why i rejected them in the first place and what made me so sure that i am good enough to teach in the secondary school and all that and then they slime me saying that i have no teaching subjects whatsoever no english what but i am not uhm technically trained in english yah lah neither am i okay yah but at least you have lang i mean lit lit lit yah i have nothing so in a way it's really a miracle and i am thankful to god lah because i faced a lot of objection from my parents it is like a big switch in my career because you are doing law you know i mean you did law and some professional degree so to them it's a kind of a sacrifice but i'm glad that i'm much happier now and they are accepting the fact i'm a happier person in the teaching profession so thank god for that what was your sister's reaction she was very upset she didn't want me to come into teaching why because in a way she she knows that it's not easy it's tough and for young teachers you may not see all the happenings within the profession it's just it's more than just teaching but then again she respected my views and i think i'll stick to it until i'm called elsewhere what did you do within that year waiting for for the next application i was doing a lot of temp jobs while waiting so in in a way i kind of wasted a year what kind of jobs clerks serious ah yes accounts clerk data entry operator all those clerical jobs ah and i spent half a year in great joy accounting person  word so close to them but it's it's a good training lah at at least i learn how to be humble and appreciate the so-called lower jobs yes that's right because with your degree uh really a lot jobs a lot of places rejected me how come saying that i'm over-qualified remember the passage that you read or not i think i know i know i think because you under applied in a way in a way they dare not employ me because i'm a degree holder you see and i only want jobs like clerical jobs and all that oh they they think i'm strange nut but it's uhm good experience for you it's a lot of it takes a lot of training and faith you know like allowing god to take control of every step of the way because you really do not know what's happening right it's so much uncertainty because i was when i was doing the odd jobs odd jobs i actually didn't know whether i they will take me in and i just went ahead and spent one year waiting and the lord is good very faithful i'm very thankful for it yah i'm quite thankful of god also i don't know and the interview was a breeze oh really because i i'm i was the last person you see then all those before me i knew them all from my lit group then they were they were they went in before me and they came out with very horrid expressions they bombarded them with lots of tough questions yah i heard so when i went in i was very nervous but i and when i'm ner when i'm nervous i tend to smile a lot you see so i went in and then the first thing they asked me was things like uhm do you have any relief teaching experience things like that then i said yes just for a week then they ask me whether uhm no what else did they ask what is my favourite author so i told them jane austin then they said oh is it everyone likes jane austin then i tell tell them then asked me about the course that i i took for lit right in in n u s and the kind of books i like read and things like that very easy it's all due to my own uhm it's like my own asking me about my own hobbies and things like that
