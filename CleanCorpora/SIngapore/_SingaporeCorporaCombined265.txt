consumers from october current import rules for rice will be relaxed and importers will be allowed to buy all types and grades of rice the trade and industry ministry says the change will come with the introduction of labelling regulations all rice bags will have to carry information on the type of rice grain composition net weight and brand they must also have the name and address of the importer or local distributor with the labelling and liberalization of uh imports of rice consumers will have an advantage in that they can make informed choices the price of rice will not increase because uh labelling costs are only a very small proportion of the cost which consumer will pay uhm i think with this labelling there should be greater variety for consumers to choose from as an importer we will benefit by diversifying our sources of supply and i think this is a good business practice as a retailer we would be able to offer more variety to our consumer and at the same time offer him lower prices the wishing singapore well has helped raise more than three hundred thousand dollars for the twenty-fifth anniversary charity fund the latest contribution came from staff of the
