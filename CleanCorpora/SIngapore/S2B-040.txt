this is the yellow crane tower
""
the symbol of wuhan city
""
it's more than a thousand years old and many poems have been written
about it
""
through the centuries it's been destroyed and rebuilt many times
""
today it stands as a proud witness to the rapid economic development
of the city construction of high-rise building everywhere
""
roads jam-packed with traffic
""
men and women buying the latest fashion
""
prosperity has greatly increased since wuhan opened its door to the
outside world last year
""
more than ten years later than the coastal cities of guangzhou and
shenzhen
""
but wuhan's economy grew by more than twelve per cent last year
""
though lower than the twenty per cent achieved by the coastal
cities it's catching up fast putting up a good fight for foreign money
""
to date more than four hundred sino-foreign joint ventures have
been approved in wuhan
""
the total amount of contract signed is a whopping two point eight
billion sing dollars
""
the joint venture partners include citroen the french car maker and
philips the dutch electronics manufacturer
""
would-be investors are in china's one billion consumers wuhan is a
better place for investment than the coastal cities
""
wuhan's strategic location has made it a key link in china's
internal trade
""
located in the meadow ridges of the yangtze river wuhan stands at
the crossing of the trade routes from beijing and guangzhou and from shanghai
to zhongching
""
this makes it an important hub for communications and inland
transportations
""
wuhan has a network of waterways linking it to fourteen provinces
in china
""
it boasts of the largest inland port
""
to make it a hot spot for investments the wuhan harbour was opened
to foreign ships last year
""
goods can now be shipped to and from countries like singapore japan
and europe
""
to make it more attractive as a foreign trade centre wuhan's
building a new international airport
""
to be completed next year the airport cost about five hundred
million sing dollars
""
currently the domestic services inland flights to twenty-five other
cities and weekly flights to hong kong
""
to link the new airport to the city and to cut travelling time down
to just twenty minutes a new highway will be built
""
this is all part of the government's plan to improve the road
system and help ease traffic jams
""
already being built a second bridge across the yangtze river
""
it's expected to be completed next year at a cost of two hundred
million sing dollars
""
massive amounts of foreign funds are needed for these projects to
upgrade the city's infrastructure
""
to meet this increase demand plans are underway to build a second
power plant and to increase the number of telephone lines
""
there may be a power shortage but there's certainly no lack of
manpower in wuhan
""
wuhan's literacy rate is one of the highest in the country
""
it has some of the top brains too
""
that's no surprise since wuhan houses some of the country's best
universities
""
wuhan is also china's third largest research centre for science and
technology
""
there are more than twenty thousand researchers working in over
four hundred research institutions
""
labour cost in wuhan is also relatively lower
""
on the average a worker takes home about a hundred sing dollars a
month
""
his counterparts in guangzhou gets twice the amount
""
the wages may be low but the people in wuhan can afford to buy big
""
the employment rate in families is high
""
with their combined income a family of four working adults can
afford modest luxuries like television sets and other electronic goods
""
with such buying power and a population of seven million people
wuhan offers a grwoing market that's worth more than two billion sing dollars
""
a lucrative market for retailers
""
currently there's only a few big stores like the wuhan department
store
""
more than two hundred thousand people walk through its doors
everyday and it's one of the ten largest in china
""
last year it chalked up sales of more than a hundred and twenty
million sing dollars
""
it's also the first department store to be listed on the shenzhen
stock market
""
besides being established in retailing wuhan also has a strong
industrial and manufacturing base
""
its key industries are in iron and steel machinery and textiles
""
the wuhan iron and steel company is the second largest in china
with annual output of about ten million tons
""
other leading industries include pharmaceutical chemical and
electronics
""
for its future growth the wuhan government wants to further develop
these existing industries
""
in addition it has also identified two other areas of growth the
automobile and high-tech industries
""
to develop these two industries the central government has
earmarked two special economic zones
""
the wuhan economic and technological development zone also known as
auto-city will concentrate on the car and its related industries
""
it should be completed by the end of this year
""
high tech products like optical fibres and electronics will be
centred in the east leg new technology development area
""
investors in these two zones will be offered the same package of
tax breaks they enjoy in the coastal cities
""
and for singapore investors the opportunities are aplenty good
infrastructure skilled labour tax breaks
""
wuhan looks set to be the next focal point in china's boom
""
it's a chance for singaporean investors to build on the
opportunities before they slip away

all secondary schools who now conduct the normal course will
be taking in these ten thousand children from the em3 classes
""
in most of these schools teachers have yet to know who among them
will be teaching these children
""
well teachers being teachers didn't want to speak openly about
their apprehensions concerning these children but from what i gather they say
they know very little about these kids apart from a few horror stories
they've heard from their colleagues
""
stories which stem from one very common public perception
""
these children for some reason or other didn't do well in the
streaming exams
""
they were placed in the em three classes and as a result branded
academically slow by many
""
with that label came others difficult unmotivated hyperactive and
restless
""
but many of these children if given the right motivation learn well
""
teachers say that the key is to engage them in activities that
interest them for example computer use
""
in fact lessons in the new normal technical course would take on a
more hand-ons and practical approach
""
there'll be role-play games and project work
""
the education ministry says they've also designed a special
syllabus and new instructional materials for these classes
""
mister hopday teaches mathematics in the em3 class through this
computer-based learning programme
""
young as they are iskandar and his friends know their priorities
""
many want to work harder this year and move on to secondary school
next january
""
it's a chance they would not have had under the old school system
and that's why they want to make good this opportunity
""
but at the same time it's going to be tough going ofr most of them
especially when they face certain realities of life things other children
don't worry about
""
i learn from their principals and teachers that these children lead
another life outside school
""
kelvin tan is fourteen years old and works part-time during the
holidays
""
the extra money helped him buy a bicycle
""
his classmate velu also holds a part-time job
""
velu works five days a week at mcdonalds
""
he starts work after school at three pm and finishes only at nine
""
it's not surprising then that these experiences have had an impact
on the children
""
so teaching these children demands something more from the teacher
patience understanding and genuine concern
""
and some of these children have a maturity far beyond their age
especially those who have gotten into serious trouble before
""
well spending sometime with children has made me realise this
""
despite what people think of them many have risen above the
criticisms to deal with what's the most important thing for now 
""
""
""
everyone needs some love and romance but in our modern society
it's assumed we'll choose that special someone by ourselves
""
suggest a matchmaker and you'd probably get the reaction in this
movie
""
matchmaking is seen as something that only happened in the past
""
gone are the days of a matchmaker or are they
""
perhaps matchmaking still lives on only in different forms and
guises and maybe we'll respond to the idea of matchmatching according to how
it's presented
""
take for example the popular game show perfect match on sbc eight
""
people are scrambling to take part and it's become prime time
televsion
""
it's literally a song and dance in this media version of courtship
as contestants try to win their perfect match
""
game show or not there have already been two marriages
""
and then there's love over the air waves
""
the deejays are so identified with the programme that they've been
nicknamed the matchmakers and they're often approached by friends and family
to pair off couples
""
but is only the media form of matchmaking popular
""
not if the commercial viability of introduction agencies like
these is anything to go buy
""
this agency alone has four thousand members
""
why the great demand for these modern matchmakers
""
icebreakers claims a marriage rate of almost forty per cent
""
that's giving the social development unit a run for its money
""
they even have a mail-order bride and bridegroom service which
finds partners from abroad
""
but in this age of computer dating you might want some added
assurance in finding that perfect match
""
well that's what many people come to this man for
""
chinese astrology george koh is often approached by couples who
want to find out if they are compatible in marriage
""
and if you think it's only the young who worry about their love
live you're in for a surprise
""
many parents are very anxious to make sure their children get
married off
""
using the traditional art of chinese face reading and chinese
astrology geroge koh advises parents on choosing the best matches for their
children
""
at a cost in doing so he also takes into account the concerns of
the parents as well
""
for marriage services mister koh gets about three hundred clients
a year mostly chinese
""
and for all that matchmaking according to the stars there are some
very down-to-earth profits involved
""
but for couples who prefer not to rely on the stars there are
other alternatives
""
meet hajar sapier a woman who has matchmade almost four thousand
marriages of all races
""
for her and her husband the reward of matchmaking is in seeing
couples
""
while olden day matchmakers receive token sums hajar sapier earns
her living by selling clothes catering malay food and also by doing
traditional malay massage
""
she believes it's her strong traditional ties which guide her in
what is very much a traditional practice
""
for the many people that come to her hajar sapier represents the
hope of finding the right person to spend the rest of their lives with
""
hajar sapier always tries to get to know the person well and she
believes in discussing the practical considerations of finding a life partner
""
it may take up to six months to find the right match
""
but the marriages last a life time
""
only one couple has split up
""
it's not surprising then that people keep coming
""
it seems that matchmaking still has a place in our society though
perhaps for different reasons
""
consuming careers may not leave much time for socialising or could
it be difficult to find someone of the same race
""
many matchmade couples are happily in love and some feel there is
a stigma attached to matchmaking
""
we spoke to one couple who is proud of their marriage the
vargheses were matchmade in their teens
""
sixteen years later they were more certain than ever of the
strengths of matchmaking though they understand the lure of modern
relationships
""
they are happy and it shows
""
in ethnic groups like theirs it's the norm for parents to arrange
children's marriages 
""
such was the case with the vargheses and they want to extend this
tradition to their children but are there concerns that matchmaking might not
always work out and most matchmaking today does compromise here suggesting a
match but not forcing it as the motto of that biggest matchmaker goes and so
on this valentine's night we wish every happiness to all couples in love
whether matchmade or not and wish here all the matchmakers do too
