mr speaker sir mr speaker sir allow me to express my appreciation for this opportunity to participate in this debate sir i have uh noticed of late nearly all the ministers if not some of the members of parliament have been lamenting that there is a trend in singapore for the people to make use of the reserves now i do not know where they get this feedback other than the fact that polls have been carried out and seems to give the impression that some singaporeans are going for more use of the reserve i think the question here is what sort of question or rather questionnaires were in fact put to the voters or to the uh resident of singapore regarding the use of reserves now if the question is simple one to say would you want to make use of the reserve to improve your living i'm afraid the answer would be a yes simply yes but i think it is important here to draw a distinction between you know budgetary surpluses and all the surpluses accumulate by the statutory bodies over the years and the question should be rightly asked: do you think the government should put all the surpluses in reserves and not just would you want to make use of reserve to improve your standard of living i think if the question had been put differently you would get a different set of answer now there are from the poll it is quite that majority of singaporean believe that singapore should have more reserves that government should put aside as reserve for rainy days i suppose the question here is it is not whether the reserve should be spent i think the question here is what is the limit that the government should put aside our surpluses as reserves now what is the limit now if that is the limit is not defined there'll be no end to the whole thing every time you clamor for more subsidies you are being accused of utilising the reserves but where where where do you stand do do we say we keep on accumulate massive reserves at the same time neglected certain area where we need to have more subsidies example will be like education housing and health now why is the government grudged that more subsidies be given in the field of education for the simple reason is now with more and more schools being converted to independent schools you are confining to only twenty five percent of them having would be able to get scholarships now what about the other seventy five percent of the students are we assuming that all students that can manage to the independent schools are from well-off family i i i thought statistics have already been given that most of them are from housing board estates that would be a clear indication that they are either from the middle or lower income group and also it has been established or it is accepted fact that the only resource we have in singapore is the human resource now why is the government not considering subsidising more for education we are so bogged down with the fear of our national reserve being used we have in fact lost the true meaning of what is the question of uh reserve being utilised and what is the question of uh you know more subsidies in certain field which is consider as investment the government should when come to question of subsidies or reserves consider how much we should accumulate as reserves not just you know keep on accumulating massive surpluses like rov we have uh more than uh one point seven billion and the hdb six hundred over billion million dollars and all the rest now with with a new introduction of uh levies of three thousand uh foreign workers and sixty nine thousand of the maids the government is going to collect over a billion dollars every year for levies alone now why are we you know every time when there is a clamor for subsidies for an essential investment we are grudging to say that we are eating into our reserves even if it it so, so be it it must be when we come to the field of education more people should be subsidised we are not not all the singaporeans who send their children to school are like all of us here who can afford it not forgetting sir if i may repeat again here we have seven hundred fifty thousand people earning only eight hundred dollars a month and then we have four hundred fifty thousand people earning only one thousand dollars a month now do you blame these people asking for more money to subsidise their children in school it is out of necessity rather than with the intention to squander away the government reserves we must do more for these people when these class of people clamor for subsidies they should have our support because it is a genuine case for want of support it is not a case of squandering away our reserves for consumption purposes which of course i would even object i am not one for welfarism but i am one that our people should be subsidised in the field of education in the field of housing i'm quite sure the government has got all the feedback these are the two fields that the government ought to look into the last election is a clear indication singaporeans felt that with the increasing fees and costs in education and health have burdened them unnecessarily to the extent that it may be you know financially unable to cope with the situation and uh i can give an exact example like it is like a millionaire making a will a millionaire making a will to the children but in the will it's said that the children can only make use of the money when they reach the age of twenty one but in the meantime they could hardly subsist they could not even live now but the will said no you can't make use of the money until you reach an age of twenty one now why can't we use more of this money for the benefit of the people in the field of education sir the next point sir i would move to word  the question of the hdb upgrading sir sir, the problem with you people is this you know you don't take you can't criticism from us when i brought up the matter i merely explained the plight of a number of people just i mentioned the fact that the plight of the retirees and the plight of those low income group has got no money for the upgrading with that your reply is that well you are against upgrading but any way it is not for my decision and luckily sir the money don't belong to any one of you here it is the people money and if the people want upgrading you have to give it to them this is what a democratic society is all about sir so my question here is uh before you call for vote in respect of housing board upgrading your flats will be improved and what would be the improvement and then whether whether it would be spread over a period of time and whether in the long run you will have to there'll be no in increase in the uh contribution of only ten percent why not now it would appear that this' another pilot project just like uh the you know kindergarten it's always pilot project you know you use the term pilot project so that you can back back out any time you want wonderful word to use this pilot project and you know speaker sir one note of clarification will you allow me to question him on mr ling you allow sir when the debate comes on the uh you know ministry of uh hdb here a lot of time to explain sir he'll have a lot of time to explain then sir mr speaker he's moved uh cut under my head mr speaker sir now now mr speaker sir i i watched the television last night on a newsreel where they they draw a comparison between the private housing estate to word  upgrading and that of hdb sir i i think it's a very wrong comparison it has no relevance at all sir you must always bear in mind one one factor when a developer bought over old flats they have it upgraded with profit in mind it is for sale so it is very different from hdb flats for all for all you know you can't sell to anybody you want to sell yes that person must be qualified in the first place you know the person must be qualified in the first place and firstly yes but you cannot sell to anybody you want you have problem to mr speaker a point of clarification i think he he must give me a chance to clarify otherwise he make a fool of himself sir sir i i won't sir because even at the last debate i was not given a chance even to to reply so why should i give him a chance to reply now sir i'm not going to give him a chance to reply hey you continue then yes sir sir the the private sector they upgrade they sell to the people sir in in the in the case of hdb flat dwell uh dwellers sir the tenants there sir most of them would be stuck there for good because they would be stuck there for good simply because of this sir because if they sell they will not be most of them will not be able to buy another one because the prices keep going up so it would be beyond the ability of most of the hdb flats to buy that sir but you'll be happier i've to stay in the open air after you stay in open air you know is the is the community uh the develop uh department willing to help these people sir the the next point sir i i won't want to dwell on this sir uh so the next point would be sir sir if i remember correctly sir uh some time back before the introduction of the tax for ps uh that telephone bill sir the government had wanted to give the first number of call free and subsequent to that they will impose a you know for every call they will impose a a a charge on that later on i believe a compromise came about on the total bill the government impose a tax on the bill sir now with the introduction of the time-based system sir i'm wondering why is the tax is still there sir the tax should have been abolished now because it's based on the number of use of the call therefore the tax should be abolished sir thank you sir yes can i take a few minutes just to clarify two points just five minutes just to illustrate that uh obviously uh mr ling hasn't read the papers or try to make himself informed about hdb policies first of all he said that uh an hdb owner cannot sell his flat anybody except to those who qualify but the qualification or the eligibility is so widely defined that more than ninety percent of singaporeans qualify an hdb owner can sell a flat to any pr any citizen there's no limit on income there's no limit on ownership of private private property so this means that an owner of hdb flat can sell his flat to almost anybody in singapore there is no restriction of course it's true only requirement is that the person stays in the flat that he should not buy the hdb flat as an investment  anybody can buy an hdb flat on a second-hand market even if he owns a private property there's no limit on income and he can be a pr or a citizen so this covers almost everybody in singapore aright so he should get this point first secondly on upgrading obviously he has not read i said almost everybody if mr chiam is advocating that a single person should be allowed to buy a five-room flat and i think he should bring it up we can debate that point whether singapore can afford it but i did not say everybody in singapore mr speaker sir i said almost everybody in fact the market is so wide that it should not affect the resale value secondly on upgrading of course all the facts are made available to those who are affected by upgrading how much will be spent on the interior of the flat how much will be spent within the block how much will be spent outside the block and not just their sums but the exact items of upgrading before they're asked to vote and they're not just merely told in descriptive language there're plans there're models there're firms so i think the member before he speaks on this should make himself fully i mean he should inform himself and if he doesn't know about it he should put a question maybe we can gain the clarification but he should not make a speech without even taking the trouble to find out the facts
