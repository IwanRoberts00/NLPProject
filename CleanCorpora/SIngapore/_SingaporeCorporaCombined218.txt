well good afternoon to all of you i would appreciate if you all of you can come down a little bit so that we can look eye-to-eye we'll see double rather than having you looking down on me i'm going to making me feel small so quickly just move down a little bit besides i don't have the neck at all i have problem raising up head true can you please come down the fact that you're here this afternoon i think speaks very well upon you this is a beginning of a very exciting word  well for tertiary institute for tertiary learning am i right to say you're first year just by show of hand i would like to know how many of you are doing first year academic subjects like history geography english literature that kind how many okay but i'm speaking to also quite a number of people who are in social sciences who are doing things like economics sociology political science am i right okay so i know whom i'm talking to good yes as i've been introduced i am chen ai-yen geetha was in nie four years ago five years ago three well only three and you can see that she is still as young as ever one of the greatest delight of a teacher is to really see your student grow and bloom and she was like that but now there's even more poise do you think that she's very very confident yes she's really happening okay of course it has nothing to do with one fact she was one of my favourites alright that she was in my tutorial and i know her intimately well well but it's not that because she talked about the challenges and realities of teaching and one of the realities is that you really know people true you people she also talked about that teaching is very very different from other jobs very true sometimes beginning you are skeptical how do you know you know this from word the others are just imagination let me tell you my personal example okay i did not join teaching as uhm a first career when i graduated from at that time it's called the university of malaya and singapore long time ago i actually join the then radio and television singapore i was a news editor it was exciting jobs i was in parliament i was chasing facts i'll be all over the place you know and you write bold stories mine you at that time because there're very few people you do more things than people nowadays because now usually they're more specilisation and i was in the job for five years there were times when dan buttsworth you know with the oil rig names people will say you want to go vietnam you want to go uh sarawak you want to go here and there and i always drawback and i said i'm only a woman you know i think it'll be too dangerous to go out to the field in that those ways it is true life out there in journalism i now it's a very very uh popular subject nowadays very exciting it's true you talk to people it's true it's people orientated but not quite centred in no time in journalism really shapes the lives of people and no time is journalist really eight hours interacting with students well i may not have eight hours in fact time word i'm dead because we were in a tertiary hold you know i am i'm not with secondary school but in secondary school it's true when you have a school function sometimes you literally live with them i know of one jc teacher who happen to be single who actually live in the school during examination time just to be with the students and all the students no wonder did very well midnight he plays basketball somebody in vjc i think some of you may know who this is alright so this is what i call a mark of dedication doing so you are a model the person did not set himself out to be a model but sometimes you became a model who is much talked about and everybody remembers him so it's not just uh imparter of knowledge he's actually a moulder of dreams a moulder of lives and it's no wonder renuka said that perhaps the reason why you're here your teachers contributed towards that of course many of you would say it is me who has done a lot of study okay so now what have i got to do when i'm here not just to affirm whatever geetha has said she said that teaching is truly exciting is truly exciting is truly challenging it's not just that but also to tell you that when you come to teaching in other profession i'm not exactly sure they truly give you a professional degree but when you become a teacher you are trained professional don't believe you go into engineering course you into accountancy course which are courses of ntu that i know quite well by now you're are given all the subjects to learn you go through practical exactly how to behave like an engineer nobody told them how true you'll say engineering and accountancy is problem-solving and keeping records what else nothing else we can tell you we teacher in word can tell you what this profession involves and how does a train look and this is what you do we have specific goals at the end of our training we can be sure that you are knowledgeable you're competent and you're reflective you look at geetha she's only one of many excellent teachers by the time you go through just a one year programme you'll be knowledgeable in the ways of the child not perfect of course everyday is a journey towards learning you'll learn more about should you go into the pgde primary programme more about children their developments if you go into pgde secondary programme you would know how all about adolescents if you go into pgde physical education programme you will be more knowledgeable about the way not only people behave but the way the physical means and built so that you can stretch how your body can really go into uhm the the the maximum you become very competent communicators one of the greatest things of professionals is to be able to communicate well i'm quite likely sure that an engineer or an accountant or well medical doctors usually speak quite well some of the people really speak very well teachers in general get through because they have specialist speech training they speak well they certainly know what they're talking the only thing is how to stop them right there might be some true that we talk all the time we are reflective i think we think over what we have done you can never find another lecture of mine exactly the same even if it is said in the afternoon you can be sure because you know how to gear our teaching to the needs of your audience you noticed what i did the very time i must know my audience i must know who i'm talking to i know you're from arts and social science the first year i know what exactly what are the subjects you're taking because it helped me in the way i pitch my conversation so reflection is not just to be about lagu word  and in deep thought and when people talk to you you don't know answer i don't mean that i mean that you factually think through and think back on the things you do so that's one way that you can grow a mark of a growing professional so the goals of our teacher education programme are simply three very simple they get not that easily achievable but you do how do we make you do this so we have courses in educational studies professional courses we have courses in curriculum studies to make you teach in subject areas this is where i come into why did i ask you to raise your hands if you are have academic subjects here in nus you're entering into the excitement of the discipline in certain discipline alright if you have academic discipline like literature english you know even chinese or or some other subject which i subjects which you take well you become you is very easy for you to become pgde secondary teachers because your specialisation subjects and later on i think rebuka uh will tell you more about that but if you are not but if you have read word  economics social work or what it is psychology and that sort of thing well chance is that you will be doing the teacher course in primary school because you don't have content knowledge or such a depth as to be able to meet the challenge of the school we have not said that you would not be parting knowledge in terms of discipline right you will but this is not the one thing you do it is one of the many things you do but it is a very important thing so you must have content now that will help you i think those of you come here we'll like to complement you and you to select your courses wisely don't just say psychology is very important sociologists are also very important but actually i want to teach in secondary school well too bad because you do not have word  academic subject whereas if you are a graduate in any of those disciplines and you want to do pe the consideration is slightly different you will really like to be very robust and strong physique and good in your physical coordinations before you can be considered you know for that kind of degree so there must be something which is natural in you before we can nurture you as well word okay and so this is quite true you have to consider teaching curriculum studies how to teach those subjects by the time you come to us we won't be teaching you the content of geography or history or literature but we will teach you how to teach those subjects i hope you can you are with me clear? okay because that helps too in the shaping uhm selection of your subjects and the third part which is very important is the time you really gain practice in school and you will have the cooperation of teachers like geetha manee i'm sure she has been cooperating teachers to some younger teachers and pass on her skills you work with professionals in a very professional way including how to handle mundane routine things like timetable nobody likes it and yet you know how to smile you know and because well in every sphere of life there are certain things you don't like to do but you just have to do okay so timetable is one instance so this is what we promise you one year programme and we will give you a fully trained programme for those of you who are in chinese or uhm uhm general not japanese chinese or malay you will be recruited into the pgde special programme where you would be taking not just uhm uh the the these courses that i am telling you in addition to educational studies and going through the practical in your curricular area you will be specialising in the languages that you're specialising and your moral education so in brief this is the course that we offer to all the graduates of gdpe primary secondary and physical education three years time four years time i'm looking forward to welcome you to with open arms as fellow professionals  good evening ladies and gentlemen uhm on behalf of the national university of singapore society i welcome you to this talk this evening my name is zaibun
