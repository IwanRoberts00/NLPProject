""
""
oh you mean for the performance
""
""
no i mean for the re for for the rehearsals
""
""
for oh ya
""
ah actually that's a that's good you know
""
""
because if we use the british council's space
""
""
ya
""
""
then we have space here and jenna's cast can can rehearse here
""
""
ya okay
""
and ya
""
but actually it was quite mean of  word  to say
that it's it's bad space because we'll we've to get to you know then after
they will not sponsor us next time
""
""
oh i see what you mean
""
""
ya
""
""
no actually it's not a bad space
""
i think i think he doesn't he's not used to working in a black box
situation so he doesn't like the substition  word  either
""
""
ya lah
""
don't know lah whatever
""
""
because i think we should show him some of the the video tapes
that we've done or show some substitution  word 
""
""
ya actually you know we should show him video tape
""
i'm going to get it
""
i'm going to pass
""
""
show him just those
""
""
i'm going to pass him scripts and all that kind of thing
""
""
no why don't we have some video tapes here right
""
""
ya
""
""
shall we just very quickly duplicate them and give him
""
uhm uhm those who
""
""
i don't duplicate
""
i don't want to keep  word 
""
script i don't mind okay  word 
""
""
no but you can takes it back if if he doesn't have time what
""
""
he's staying in don't know what hotel
""
i'm sure they've got a video right

""
""
ya
""
""

""
""
ya
""
""
what else
""
""
more
""
""
more
""
ya

""
lanterns

""
lanterns
""
""
lanterns will be quite a good taping because of the festival
""
""
no 'lanterns' was 'lanterns' was at the arts festival

oh but because no my concern is that i i think that he should
change his mind about the substation
""
""

""

""
""
""
no we just show we just give him a a range of tapes from the
drama centre ones as well as the substation ones lah
""
""

""
""

good idea or not

""
ya

okay then the ah never going to get my things done
""
""
what things
""
""
uh aiyah all my  word  fifteen minutes
""
""
the the the life scripts
""
""
beng chiak is very upset just now
""
""
i don't blame her
""
""
ya
""
she was i've never seen her so
""
when she get upset uh
""
""
she want to break down and cry right
""
""
if she get upset she'll like 'yes you want talk to me'
""
""
ya uhm
""
""
no why i'm why i'm annoyed about is that when i spoke to
enita
""
""
enita
""
""
she said she doesn't want to do it so okay fine
""
uhm she said then she said like actually shoberth can do it but
it's just that they didn't communicate properly and all that with beng kiang
all that
""
i said whatever
""
then i said
""
then she explained
""
i said no you don't have to explain
""
i i'll just do it
""
she said why are you not upset
""
i said well i'd rather not get emotional about these things
""
i i'll just be functional and and and detached and practical
""
then she said like okay that's good
""
then uhm she said will you call beng kiang
""
i said i will call beng kiang but not to tell her that you don't
want to do it but i think you should call her and tell her that you don't
want to do it
""
but i'll call beng kiang later and just talk about
""
okay so now what we do
""
but what i'm most annoyed about is that she called beng kiang and
she told beng kiang
""
""
to call
""
""
that i will talk to her you know and said beng kiang called
me  word 
""
yes you want to talk to me
""
i said uhm ya did enita call you
""
said she said yes
""
then i said uhm so did did she tell you she can't do it
""
she said yes so you want to talk to me about what
""
you know like uh
""
ya i thought we know you'd better talk about what other
possibilites there are and all that kind of thing
""
""
no what what i was really annoyed with enita was was okay she
she she blamed beng kiang for the shobun thing
""
you know what i mean
""
""
ya
""
""
as in like it's it's uhm uhm they never communicate
""
she never explain properly to her and now because at the end of
the day  word 
""
what it means is enita cannot go on holiday
""
you know what i mean or not
""
i can't help thinking that even if she's concerned about shobun
""
i can't help thinking that that that at the end of the day it's
because if or or it doesn't work out she cannot go on holiday
""
""
ya
""
""
you know is it and this is very irritating because it's irres
""
i still feel it's irres(irresponsible)
""
that's why she doesn't want to talk to me about it you see
""
because i told her yesterday i think you should do it
""
""
no but i don't want to be
""
i don't want to like tell people you must do you must not do
""
if you don't want to do don't do just say no or yes
""
i don't want to even hear reasons because you are adult enough to
to to to go and rationalize this and you know
""
""
ya
""
no no
""
because the thing is that why why i felt that uhm one of us had to
say it was because uhm on beng kiang's behalf you see because i think beng
kiang felt that it's it's very difficult
""
because beng kiang will feel that at the end of the day that we
didn't we didn't uhm tsk do anything about it
""
""
no but these things you just have to like live with it kind
""
i mean look at those who can't teach wants his face pulled out
like two weeks before like what i mean you go to him and you say no you must
not leave that kind of thing  word 
""
i think you should stay and all that
""
""
no that's different you see but then you see that's different
because you you are involved in it
""
alvin's involved in it and we explained blah blah blah blah right
""
the problem with this beng kiang thing is that it's enita you see
""
enita is supposed to be one of us kind of thing and at and while
while we we receive  word  production support and all that
""
then it's like beng kiang says ya
""
uhm you know she asked me that day is is enita always like that
""
does she do this very often
""
i said no as far as i know
""
i said she she does have some time constraints and stuff
""
that's why in in reference to the group she's very clear about it
""
she she cannot come for this she cannot come for that
""
it's okay you see
""
""
ya
""
""
but she's clear from the onstart
""
but i said i guess this is an unusual circumstance because she
also didn't expect to be here  word 
""
to be given the luxury of leave suddenly you see
""
you know what i mean
""
but then it's like if we all if we if we don't say that uhm you
have a responsibility to do it then it's like we are being lax you see
""
you know what i mean
""
""
ya
""
""
and it's not as if we're offering a lot of of of uhm uhm
alternatives to beng kiang
""
""
ya
""
""
it's it's at this moment we're very stretched for 
word  as if we have  word 
""
and i told i told enita there
""
and then i said i said i i have to admit
""
my main priority at that point  word  one week
ago is is uhm dawn
""
because dawn hasn't even started you see and and the way enita put
it is like okay so the script is not written yet you know so it's alright if
i pull out
""
it's not true you see and i i so i told beng kiang i know why
she's very panicky
""
so i said let's
""
i i told beng kiang that day in in the that uhm shop
""
even if it's not enita if it's shoberth whoever
""
i said your main priority now is to is to polish up the cast and
get the show on the road because she said ya then the script  word
 in the script will be  word  and all that
""
i said but
""
i said this is the is you know for the audience
""
you you want the audience  word  to find out
whether it's going to be a good script or not right
""
so you must like you
""
you can't give  word  make house situation
 word  where everybody says aiyah don't know
""
this part didn't work
""
don't know whether it's the cast the director or the or the script
kind of thing
""
""
ya
""
""
so i said if the direction is good and the the cast is good
then at least we can say ah okay it's the script
""
this is the problem where but that's constructive you see
""
so ya lah that's why
""
""
so now we just meet someone who is free for two weeks and who
is good and who can just can just do it
""
""
ya but that's easier said than done
""
""
tomorrow morning lah
""
what's happening tomorrow morning
""
about just  word  
""
""
okay no that's why i'm very i'm very i'm very uhm confused
right now about this because it's like do we do we find someone for her or is
shoberth doing it or what
""
""
no she said she'll go and talk to shoberth and beng kiang
beng kiang and if shoberth can't do it then we'll find someone lah
""
""
okay so  word 
""
""
i told her i said i will ask kah wai she said no it's not a
role for kah wai i said okay then we just have to think of someone
""
""
jowee
""
""
uh
""
""
cos'
""
""
ah ya actually it's something jowee can do seriously but we
have to ask her lah but i don't want i rather do
""
""
i don't want another one of these another 'i did you a
favour you owe me one  word  '
""
""
ya ya
""
""
how
""
""
uh let's hope  word  okay we go out we're
going where are we going   lauhs  we're going to eat at environment building
ah
""
""
i don't mind i haven't eaten there for the whole week you
all have right
""
""

""
""
