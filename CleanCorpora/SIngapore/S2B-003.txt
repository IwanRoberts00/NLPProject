for over at bukit batok a rally was held by the sdp

speaking at workers' party rally at eunos grc where he was a
candidate was mr wee han kim
""
he touched on the programme of the workers' party
""
basically it is to give you more freedom more quality of life
""
the pap is very good at giving you the bread and butter the bread
and butter issues but when it comes to the quality of life they are hopeless
""
when you got your jobs when you got your three meals a day when
you got your flat and you want a better quality of life come to the
opposition
""
we have all the ideas we can give you a better quality of life and
we can give you some fun on the way and have a few laughs at the same time
""
now they talk about the next lap
""
they want to endorse the next lap
""
what is in the next lap
""
have you seen that book
""
it's got a nice cover
""
a coffee table book is one that you never open the cover because
you got to see the inside
""
there's nothing there there's no substance
""
""
at bukit batok the sdp candidate mr ling how doong picked on
the topic of increases in costs of education
""
""
all of you must be aware that government have slowly
converted most of the schools to independent school and of course after the
conversion the fees goes up between seventy-five to two hundred dollars
""
it is slowly beyond the reach of most of us here and uh that is
not the problem 
""
you the government is telling you very well if you can't go to
independent school you can always go to the other government school but all
the good teachers qualified teachers experienced teachers have been attracted
to the independent school you would expect a much higher standard of living
in the independent school to attract you people to go to the independent
school and the university fees have been increased many times i can well
understand if the government has got no money but the government has been
accumutat accumulating vast surpluses every year to the tune of nine billion
dollars a year and yet the government is not prepared to subsidise more for
our children education
""
""
at nee soon where the pap held a dialogue session the
minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo said the
prime minister's right to govern must be confirmed in this general election
yeo: mr goh chok tong's right to govern must be confirmed in the general
election and for this reason in every constituency he is the candidate the
rest of us we are just supporters we are his representatives if we are
comfortable with his vision if we are comfortable with his style of
government if we are comfortable with the team he has brought around him then
let us show it in a resounding way and the stronger the backing he gets from
us the more effective his leadership can be this is the issue and it is very
important that the voters of singapore in this general election bear in mind
all the other issues are really technical matters but if we get this right
and if we unite around mr goh chok tong then singapore's future will be
secured you know really we're feeling uncertain we do not know what may
happen next no one expected this coup in the soviet union and very few
expected that this coup will collapse so quickly and who knows what may
befall us next month or the month after when news reached singapore about the
coup immediately the stock market plunged over sixty points when the coup
collapsed stock market went buck up went back up again the world is too small
no distance is too great it is one global village whatever happens anywhere
will affect us directly and what is most important is that we are united and
we work together and we have the instinct to care for each other then our
future will be secure
""
""
during the dialogue session residents took the opportunity
to discuss issues which concern them this ranged from new identity cards the
opposition's call to people to vote in more opposition members of parliament
and the proposed edusave scheme p: mr goh chok tong has come up with the
edusave scheme which signals the government concern over the less affordable
population this is a good sign but now the scheme only catered for students
who wants to take up the extra-curricular classes so obviously the scheme
will only go to a group of people who may not even require the subsidy since
it is the intention of government to help the less affordable why not allowed
those student nuh to allow the scheme to make use of the scheme to pay for
their tuition classes uh textbooks and so on and so forth that i think will
be more constructive yeo: you're right i think this is the way the government
will eventually go because what we do not want is to treat human beings like
commodities to be produced and assembled in the production line where every
product looks the same what we want is to respect each individual for what
they are as individuals different and unique and for each individual to
develop to the limit of his god-given potential in a sense the education
system must be customised for him so education ministry's policy si to move
towards greater choice for parents and then schools and teachers will then
respond to the pattern of parental choice what government will do through
edusave is to give to parents these kids as it were to place as they wish in
a way they think will best bring up the children and invest in their
potential we are starting in a limited way because the system can easily be
opened to abuse but as we go along as we gain experience as we get more
feedback as principals and teachers and parents think of new ways of
investing better in their children then i think the system will broaden p:
now there has been rumours that uh medical fees parking coupon fees and uh
hospital ward charges will be increased after might be increased after the
election in fact the opposition is capitalising on this issues can you please
enlighten us yeo: we must not forget that the people who work to provide us
these services the people who work in telecoms who work in hospitals doctors
nurses attendants they're also singaporeans they're also want to enjoy six
eight percent improvement in their standard of living every year so they'll
have to be paid for so from time to time adjustments will have to be made but
over a period of time we must try to keep costs as low in singapore as
possible and indeed any economist any statistician who looks at costs in
singapore basic necessities education health whatever will know that in
singapore we have just about the lowest inflation rate in the whole world for
the last twen ten to twenty years the lowest inflation rate in ten to twenty
years that is quite an amazing quite an amazing achievement why why does the
government do that the government keeps inflation rate down because all of us
have our savings in the cpf and it's very important that we keep the value of
the singapore dollar steady otherwise if there's inflation really it is
government breaking off your savings and my savings isn't it yes of course we
must expect the opposition to always harp on the negative side on the cost
increases but they never mention when our telephone rates go down the
technology improves they never talk about the improvement in services and
most of all the increase in the incomes of singaporeans and in their assets
in the old days i mean to eat two bowls of rice was a nec necessity because
you work a lot and you needed all the calories but today people are very
conscious you know i mean they will cut down the rice the the chicken skin
they'll put aside so we have made tremendous progress and i hope that
sometimes when there're irritations when you know particular fees go up that
we take a step back and say look let's take a look at the overall balance
sheet has life improved have we been better off have we been better off
compared to other countries ten years ago twenty years ago we have done very
well and what we want to do the pap government is to continue with this
progress this development this yearly increase in our quality of life and in
our standard of living but of course the market is not is unequal in its
outcome and some people do much better off than others so the pap is
committed to making sure that those at the bottom however bad their luck or
whatever mistake they make or whatever problems they may face that at the
bottom if they are in trouble we will help them
""
""
at the dialogue session in bukit timah mr lee hgn kiang an
unopposed pap candidate of tanjong pagar grc said the prime minister's
consultative style of leadership isn't something abstract he gave two
examples of how it affects people's lives in concrete ways kiang: nowadays
when we develop plans at the ministries or the departments we take special
care to consult the people who are affected by all these plans i can give one
example even when we develop parks we now bring the plan of the park to the
"people and say, "" this is what we are developing are you happy with it"" and"
we are surprised with the results that comes out for example we're developing
"a neighbourhood park and the residents say, "" look we have a very active qi"
kong group here hundred members why don't you change the park a little bit so
that we can have our qi kong practice in the park instead of uh in the in the
field between the blocks uh so we mange to do that and they're all happy the
the park is is served the the people better and the people are happy that
they are consulted and they got concrete results in the development of the
park in the last few years we've also stepped up town councils that is
another very concrete example of how the prime minister's new style has led
to a change in the way we run things in government this is in fact the seed
of local government being planted and it will evolve more participation more
consultation more decisions devolve down to the ground so when the prime
minister put his leadership style as an issue in the general election please
understand that this is not something that is abstract this is going to
affect all our lives in very concrete ways
