dear friends and residents of ulu pandan
""
the peoples' action party is very fond of introducing candidates
with high paper qualifications
""
they will introduce doctors architects and engineers and
what-have-you but they have failed to realise one very important thing
""
not everyone with a high qualification can be a good politician
simply because it is not only the paper qualification that make you a good
politician
""
the pre-requisite of a good politician is one who is responsible to
his own conscience and we adopt our system from england
""
now in england members of parliament would vote against their own
party if it is against their conscience but not in singapore
""
in singapore i will tell you one thing
""
no matter how qualified they are they are considered political
cripple they are political handicap
""
now what is the use of you standing a gp candidate of parliament
when he cannot do your bidding
""
they are supposed to be your representative but in parliament they
represent the peoples' action party not you
""
therefore you must always consider this factor when you vote for
member of parliament
""
you won't the only people that can effectively be members of the
opposition in parliament would be the opposition himself
""
the peoples' action party has declared their manifesto and the next
lap
""
now to give you in order to give you some insight of what is in
store for you in the next lap let us consider the vision and pap has told you
in 1984 election the vision of 1999
""
now they are they are saying that we are going the next lap
""
what have they done so far that affect the life of the middle and
the lower income group in the past
""
since 1988 you have seen the government imposing tax taxes fees
levies at a short interval of a few months
""
you will note you have noticed the car park fees have gone up
television fees have gone up taxi diesel tax have gone up car prices of
motorcar has gone up diesel petrol has gone up and hdb flat has gone up the
list goes on
""
i don't have to tell you i'm quite sure you know what they are now
having known the power of the pap you will know what is in store for all of
you in the next lap
""
the people's action party has already passed a law in parliament to
impose consumption tax on all of you
""
they need only to gazette the item in order to put them in practice
are you aware of consumption tax
""
the consumption tax will the tax on the daily necessities of what
you and i would use shoes clothings food drinks everything under the sun
""
they will i would i can assure you if you give them more than the
41 seats in parliament it would be considered as an endorsement for them to
carry out this
""
in other words they would really introduce consumption tax sooner
than expected
""
you see the when we critisises the government for increasing the
hospital fees medical charges the fees for education they came up with the
idea of edusave and medifund
""
mind you they have not given any details of what will be the
edusave or the medifund
""
we do not know it came out it sprang a surprise by telling you that
they will look into these things
""
my answer is a simple one don't tell us edusave don't tell us
medifund reduce the charges of more hospital fees and ward charges reduce the
fees for independent schools and for the university
""
i have said it last night and for the benefit of those who have not
hear me i will tell you again and you tell me whether it is a fact that the
government has subsidised us in respect of medical charges or ward charges
""
very simple one i am sure everyone of you here is aware of this now
when you have a cold or flu or cough you go to a private clinic here you see
a doctor here how much you pay for the visit 10 to 14 dollars you agree with
me
""
you go to singapore general hospital you go and see a doctor there
how much would you pay consultation is 12 dollars with medicine is about 15
dollars almost the same
""
where is the subsidy where is the subsidy you tell me first
""
i want to find out where is the subsidy
""
are you telling me the private clinic are also subsidising us also
and for the ward charges let me tell you
""
i have checked with the private hospitals here they are providing a
three-bedding ward with air-con colour television and private telephone and
they are charging 145 dollars a day and you know how much they are charging
at the singapore general hospital
""
i won't talk of the who is charging 220 dollars the singapore
general hospital is charging you 140 dollars and with something added in 175
dollars
""
no air-con no colour television where is the subsidy where is the
sudsidy you tell me first
""
unless the private hospitals are also subsidising us and mind you
the private hospital can charge us 145 dollars a day i think they must have
made 20 dollars
""
in other words their basic cost is only 70 dollars and you must
always remember this factor a private hospital is put up with a tremendous
investment by individual who would suffer loss if the hospital has no
buisness
""
they would have gone bankrupt and they are charging us a cost of 70
dollars
""
what about the general hospital and the kandang hospital who build
the hospital who fund all from our money taxpayers' money
""
therefore if a private hospital can charge us 145 dollars the
government should charge us 40 dollars because private hospitals' cost is
only 70 dollars and if government charge us 10 70 dollars 40 dollars they
don't subsidise us much because hospital has been paid for by our taxpayer
money
""
you ask your mp whether they can answer me
""
it's simple simple arithmetic we don't need to go to the university
to acquire you know a degree in mathematics
""
simple arithmetic you get the answer
""
where is the subsidy absolutely none and the government is telling
all this while they are being subsidising us
""
this is the type of government we have
""
they tell us a lot of things they juggle the figures and that's it
and one more factor you must always remember
""
singapore is only interested in the intellectuals those people of
intelligience not merely graduate they want the best of the graduate the
president's scholars they are only treated with respect
""
the rest of the rest of all of us here who are not president's
scholars are considered in the eyes of digits
""
we are digits this is what happen in singapore and you must when
you cast your vote always remember this how shabbily all of us have been
treated all the middle and the income group have been treated
""
it is easy for the minister to increase the fees because the prime
minister is being 49000 dollars a month and the ministers are being paid
31000 dollars a month who has been in singapore between 400 and 450 thousand
people earning 1000 dollars a month
""
this is the difference in the pay of the ministers getting and the
people getting here you know
""
they have been telling people oh people in the private sector are
getting much more than in the government service then resign go into private
practice nobody is forcing you to be in the government service
""
if you want to be in politics you must always remember one thing in
politics it is always sacrifice and more sacrifice and you must remember they
ahve increased their salary and pay once
""
there is nothing to stop them to increase their salary again
because there is no control over how much they can get
""
if they like it they just increase the pay and you must also
remember half the workers in singapore is getting only 800 dollars a month
after cpf deduction the take-home pay is a poor thing 650 dollars a month
""
can you afford to send your children to independent school charging
a fee of 200 dollars a month
""
can you afford to send your children to the university take up
medicine or dentistry paying 10800 dollars a month
""
this is the government that really look after you these are all
facts and figures let me sound a ward of a word of warning for all of you
""
if the pap on the 31st of august take the other 30 seats don't say
40 seats get another 30 seats it is considered as an endorsement for what
they have done because they have done exactly that in the past
""
they say there you are you know the elected president we said you
must hold a referendum they say no need to hold a referendum because at the
last election opposition has been talking of an elected president and you
have voted us in you have
""
in other words indirectly endorsed the elected president so they
will be adopting the same stance when you come the next general election
""
therefore because they are always going on what your votes they use
your votes as an yardstick to measure whether you endorse their policy or not
""
and you know i i'm really surprised it really shows how desperate
the pap leadership is
""
now they they have told us in the past before the introduction of
the bill in parliament of elected president they say we want the elected
president to prevent opposition from squandering away the national reserves
""
they said national reserves are meant for emergency now
""
you have just heard mr goh chok tong telling us he's going to use
the national reserves for edusave and medifund
""
where is the emergency is there any emergency this is the double
standard we get from the pap leadership when they use the money
""
no need emergency when they use the money they are not squandering
away the money but when we use the money they say we are trying to squander
away the money
""
it takes a bigger thief to catch a thief you know
""
you they must have thought that they themselves are capable of it
that is why they think we are capable of doing that we opposition are a
different category of men and remember in parliament
""
so far you know i look at parliament seating now it's a melodrama
it's a melodrama because you find the member of parliament of the peoples'
action party full of sound and fury signifying nothing and have you seen a
member of parliament vote against any motion in parliament
""
they make a lot of noise wasting public fund wasting our time
wasting the television time for what for nothing for nothing
""
if you want genuine opposition in parliament only opposition party
can provide and we have put up a credible slate of candidates nine of us
""
put us in we will show you what real opposition is about we will be
your voice
""
let me tell you this if lim boon heng were i will vote against the
government and represent the people i will step down i will support him ask
him to think about that
""
i will be prepared to step down it is impossible
""
therefore you people must always remember this when you go to the
poll on the 31st of august because it involves your future it involves your
children's future
""
i know most of you here are very comfortable you have got a house
you have a roof over your head you have got a car you can go on holiday every
month but please your children may not be as successful as you are
""
your children may a tertiary education but by then the competition
will be so keen they may not do as well as you are 
""
you must be able you must do one thing and you must be able to
look into children'eye and say i have done my best people know in singapore
we have been doing 200 persons suffering of kidney ailment very month every
year they are without help and you must remember kidney ailment we do not
know the cause neither can we prevent it but anyone of us here who get it and
don't say oh i'm healthy now but once you get it it is going to be a triple
blow to your whole family and your children may get it we must fight for
these poor people they get this disease through no fault of theirs they get
kidney ailment not because they drink not because they smoke not because you
know they do things and hurt their own health no such thing people have got
no heart this is your opportunity if you want your voice to be heard if you
want the pap to respect you they are coming to you now shedding crocodile
tears begging for you to put them give them a full mandate but mind you once
you do that you will have to suffer another 5 years and by then it 's not
going to be the next lap it will be your collapse thank you
