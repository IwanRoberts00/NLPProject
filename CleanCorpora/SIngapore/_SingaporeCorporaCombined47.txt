my sister was trying to teach him to read his alphabets the three year old one ah the three year old one he is like very slow but he can recognise places and all that you know just that when you teach him uh he doesn't want to repeat after you so she got so she got so mad i think you can't force them ya you can't force them my kids also when i try to read to them they will hold the book and bite the book ya run away with the book ya because i think at this time the attention span is very short ya very short i think different lah because i remember my first nephew ah who's now in the poly already ah so uhm i think word of his age he would've been able to listen to stories you know i tell him stories and then he would be interested but uh this boy quite not so interested one he is interested in cars and he likes car he will play with his cars all the time my kids love balls every time they go to ball ball ball ball then they scream until you buy for them oh so now what we do is we keep a pack of balloons in the bag so when they scream for ball we give them one balloon ya but it's not very good lah to give in to them all the time then they will they will think that you know ya especially if you bring them shopping then they start screaming it'll be terrible actually my friend told me it's not very good to buy things in front of them if they want it later on you come back to buy if you buy on the spot they get the idea that whatever they want you buy ya but i think most singaporean kids are spoilt because now they only have two or three only actually it's very very tiring looking after kids ya i must have aged a lot you know giving birth look but at least once they grow up you you are free lah ya more relaxed uh i think one thing good about twins is that they can play together you see ya so now when i see them sometimes one hug the other or what give them two biscuits they will give one to the one you feel quite nice share ah share you see i think they like to call each other name you know refer to each other their own code you know very funny oh like timothy uh jeremy will call him ti don't know why you know ti ti so funny ah then the other one call the other one will call jeremy xie because jeremy is yenxie you see oh somehow he call him xie oh so when you give him their pacifier they know which one is theirs 'cause different shapes oh so if you give him jeremy's one he will say xie xie xie xie so cute ya but you can you can are they i mean can they be distinguished or not of course you would know lah that the mother most of the time to us they look quite different but somedays uh suddenly they would very much the same lah oh but jeremy has a mole quite high up here lah oh so you can recognise it at first when they had no mole we have to tie things to their legs lah because the hospital tied things you see oh i see so we just kept that on just to make sure we don't oh they must me really identical ah to us they look not so much the same when they were younger yes lah then about four months they uh jeremy had a mole oh so that was uh much better ya but now when you look at the photographs some photographs cannot see the mole lah we can't tell oh at that time uh we could tell you know ya for one of my sister who doesn't come so often she can't tell ya i think recently after taking no pay leave uh you become hot tempered oh when you are with them scream scream when you are with them all the time ya because kids are like that you ask them not to climb they will climb ya so now especially at a certain age you know they'll start climbing you got to jagar them lah ya because they don't know what is dangerous you know ya i think when they're about uhm my friend told me eighteen months then that time okay because eighteen months they supposedly they can understand you and all that but i think should be around two to three i think different stages they have different types of problems ya that's true just like my niece and nep my niece and my nephews they sort of they sort of grew up in my home my eldest nephew my mother sort of took care of him for about um two over years uh uh because my sister-in-law was working full-time so quite difficult lah for them by the time they come home they had a baby-sitter and they come back about eight something then haven't cook and all that you know so my mother said okay lah come and you know she'll look after and he sort of practically grew up and he was the first grandchild so very pampered you know and uh then after that the others they sort of maybe the others didn't stay as long as this eldest one you see then i this one my this present one the three year old one my sister comes practically every day so we see him all the time this boy sort of grew up in this house you know so i mean at least if when they come in when they come over they've more of us lah my mother and all that me my brother you know so you don't get only one if you're faced with one kid you'll die man the whole day so sort of like not really take turns lah the child also got other people to run to you know and play with actually for them especially at the young age interaction with other people is very important ya but sometimes you can't sort of draw the line you know i mean like you want them to be sociable yet they don't want them to be too sociable because they will go to strangers and you know they they don't i mean how to fear strangers they might just follow them ya but it's true lah at each stage there is problem then after they go to school you worry about their homework and all that ya that's right then they word  my other sister has two of them one is already in sec two this girl and then the boy is uh i think primary five or primary six i always get them mixed up she's always nagging them ya the school system is so competitive that's why you've got to make sure that they study and study ya then later you worry about them girlfriend boyfriend ya lah then after that their work ya throughout your life you're worrying even they settle their family ya then settle down i think you're forever worry worry ya i mean i think when they have kids and then when their kids get ill ah ya then you worry about the kids about the child i suppose that's part of life lah ya but i suppose if he can take it deeply then it's okay no lah i don't think you think so far ahead one lah you just when it comes along then one at a time and that's enough lah ya but you never thought that you have twins lah you didn't know lah or or you you knew at six weeks i knew oh you were more or less prepared lah ya ya but if if not prepare it'll be a real shock ah ya i mean all along i thought it'll be nice to have twins lah think my brother told me it's fat hopes because of the low low it doesn't run in the family ya i remember i told him to record every anything if possible then it turned out it's true ya i suppose in a way it's quite nice lah you know to bring them up in one shot ya because then they will study together same level i mean initially i think the expenses will be more because we've to buy books and everything maybe but later on i think it's all right don't know whether it can be so like because like like uhm in my family the niece the nephews hand down lah all hand down i see because they all outgrow so quickly and then ya it's true you know  word rather than throw it away it's too good to throw away so it get rotated to cousins and  word  ya i think most people do that but my sister mary she loves buying clothes for them she insist on wearing the same clothes you know she keeps buying clothes for them i think most of their clothes they wear two three times only so many ah now my whole cupboard is packed i think twenty to thirty suits each wow then shoes they have so many pairs she like must match match them that's a waste lah because especially i mean you buy two sets then if you have another one you hope it's a girl lah then you can't really wear unless you sort of word ya  word i mean dressing them same same you know when they are young it's quite fun lah of course when they grow up they won't like to wear the same ya but one thing i think i mean i think you they've companionship you know but the book says you have to sort of uh try to let there be times when they're separate you know they need time to have their own space to grow what and also when they grow up of course inevitably there'll be sometimes when if they go to different schools or what you know so from young they should sort of know that there are sometimes when they are not together otherwise they will feel very insecure once the other one is not there when the other time when you were doing your exams you were still teaching right you had to right was it very stressful very stressful and especially this year because i had to go to a new school oh i was uh transfer out what school was that uh it's that kwan yang kwan yang guangyang never heard it's at bishan and it's yangzhong one of the very very lousy schools hah i don't know it's at bishan you know bishan do you live near there not so near lah but it's it's about ten minutes drive not bad not not not bad but it's very different from the previous school i was in i was from cedar you know that was a girl's school you see so i have no discipline easier to handle right no ya easier to handle no discipline problems just only once stream express then here we have normal stream normal stream you know and then it's mixed co-ed and the and there's discipline problems also so uhm i it was very difficult lah in in because you know new school new environment new adjustment and all that kind of thing but i don't know by the grace of god it's still uhm because it was it was quite and especially beginning of the year when did you join this  ha when did you join i only went in beginning of the year what oh january when school reopens january ya so then i also don't know whether how the school will take to the fact that i am doing this course and uh also that's why i mean i was actually at first i thought at first i thought the our exam would be uh uh you know originally our exam plans was what uh not not what it was foley actually told us it was something else lah so then when i got the exam timetable and then there was all these series of workshop on saturdays you know so i was thinking i better tell the principal lah because you know you can't take off like that so i told her lah i said i'm taking a course
