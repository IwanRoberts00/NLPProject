for his a e he he he did my family do you know who's jonathan no jonathan that one lah mixed lah uh half uh indian half chinese he i mean he so what we are you sort of like church friends ah you were so natural oh you only had one case study ya oh he had two oh all of you for a.e.s you all went around collecting data no it a.e.s mine not collecting data his was so we i had to like secretly tape conversations within my family i did my brother and and this friend talking about something they like their hobby cds so they're yakking and yakking and yakking over the phone nuh no they were yakking in the room so i just word  left their recorder there really it was so wonderful oh all the scarly all came out ya i know for for ours worse because we i taped the fam you see if it's just me and my parents then it's it's okay you see but then my godma came into the picture and then her friend came into the picture and then everybody started talking so there was a mixture teochew you know english word  word  it's quite word  you see when my relatives get together you hear cantonese baba english ya then i speak to my cantonese relatives in baba ya boy that yesterday i saw the the docu you know which one uhm archie's mental or illness in  word what do you think it's very bad why i didn't even have time to think about the structure i didn't even have time to think about the word  or word  the the picture's very rushed very emotional right no i i just that ethical problem put me off because she did i i i don't know whether word told you i heard she i heard she word the faces or blotched out the faces but then on on other shots i saw them then what's the point see she had this media case study okay this uh mentally ill man okay he he uh okay she when she introduced him that time you could see that she didn't really want to show his face you see that's fine and then she showed one part where she's introducing the mother you see so you think there is nothing wrong you know because uhm she didn't really set out to hide their faces you see so there's this shot of the mother walking you see walking to uh the the dining table okay to to get medicine for the son and she walked towards the dining table you can see obviously that that you know the lights all coming from the window you know so if they they wanted to like cover her face word okay that's fine then then after that you can't see her because she cut to her legs walking and then cut to her shot of her at the table already you see the next thing you know they cut to this shot of her where the camera was taking by the side so it's already quite dark you know the glow uh you know the glare and all that is no longer there you know and you could see the mother you could see the mother and then she says ah seng uh you know come what's the point like that you see no see so for for me i thought that this is nothing you know i thought that there was no attempt actually you know to to hide their face you know then when the interview came on it was in dark silhouette and the woman was speaking very emotionally she cried you see you know what i mean or not she's speaking and then she was crying you see then you knew oh no she was supposed to hide the woman's face but how come i saw maybe you should ask archie must you know i i'm going to tell i'm i think it's ethical problem because i i unless the lady agreed to be filmed later on i can put me off or either that or she no but if she agreed didn't she didn't tell her what she's filming it's bluff lah come on you know that's quite it's very unfair to the family what it's very unfair and then never mind you know okay then you see you know there's this uhm then after that they cut away to the mother talking about her the her her psycho son right uhm so he he's at the void deck you know downstairs you know those stone seats ya ya so he's puffing away you see ah then so they cut to this wide shot he's alone talking to himself smoking wide shot but the angle the camera is high you see uh huh and you can see the man's face  laughs  you see and then later they cut to his eyes then they cut to his his hands holding the cigarettes and then you can see the face then slowly it's like photo fade you're beginning to see the whole face you know then what's the point i was so disgusted you know and then they cut from another part okay where he's talking to himself in hawker centre okay she took a back shot so obviously she didn't want to show his face but in in terms of dealing with issues was it i was so upset with that i didn't even think much of the issues you know so i was i was thinking it's so disgusting you know and the problem is is is the whole series over no over already how many three only uh three the divorce one just finished how was the divorce one i don't know lah but you know very depressing lah entire three-week you know the way they did the trainers you know whoa very sad that's the way it is what but anyway the the mentally ill one in terms of issues i felt that i didn't learn anything more it's like the usual things that you would ask the old you know mentally ill people how you cope the difficulty no no no not how they cope you know but uhm how how  word  difficult it is for them to like word  that's all lah you see but then it wasn't well-rounded because they kept on saying you know from from the perspective so it's just milking sympathy ya because they kept on saying that these poor chaps not not hard hard look lah at at the you know uh uh employers don't want to give them a a a a job you know poor things and all that you see so it's just like mental illness awareness kind of thing nothing deeper they didn't get the they didn't get employers' point of view on why certain mentally ill people they're looking into it may not be suitable that is the one you know they're doing you must have an answer your docu can't be one-sided what but in the end you all saying that ya these poor chaps you know ya trying so having ya having a hard time you know can't integrate into society it's all their fault so i i i don't know lah i ah i went for the health screening just now how cholesterol level safe really are they still having it on now no more already aiyoh but i paid five dollars i wanted to you know i called you at nine-thirty i went down already i know i called you then see how much blood did they one jar a lot uh no lah one tube uh one tube that's a lot just to find out the sugar and the cholesterol lah aiyah i should have gone and the the what it was so messy don't know whether the reading's correct whether it is really my reading or somebody else's but the needles are all disposables right i hope so no they are my brother says now they have all moved towards disposables already i'm sure there are a number of hiv positive people there ya eeeee no but if you you should have tested for aids on the word  uh uh no lah what for then people won't know you see no if they do that our dear bachtiar will be most oh he's on leave don't worry he'll be most aghast why he doesn't want to know no he says that it's it's an intrusion invasion of a person's privacy if you just test for hiv without asking for permission which is true lah you see no but i think as long as you go to a government clinic and you know that they are going to test for hiv then you're then it's okay you have no right already ya you've you you know that definitely word you go there knowing what ya but then again then they'll say why in the first place must the government you know do that that means whenever you test for blood they will test for hiv also i mean like you go and say you go and say can you test my blood level can you test cholesterol but you know how how this based on you you see you give them permission test for blood test for i mean test for sugar test for cholesterol but you don't say if you say don't test for hiv they can't then don't go to a government clinic uh huh aiyah i don't know lah this hiv thing is so actually there are so many issues you know even if you talk about aids you know uhm uhm you know the docu that you did uhm okay that's one part that's only one part only ya docu cannot you know do everything there's a lot more ya but but thought of looking into rights and all that ya like like this thing that you just brought up you see i mean on the one hand bachtiar does have a point to make you see i mean no matter what you have a right to say that what my body should be tested for uhm you know what i mean or not if if you don't want to know whether you got cancer or not you know you you you just don't test for it they can't test you without your permission you see you know but then uh on the other hand there are other you know things lah i think they should set up anonymous testing uhm that's what he suggested anonymous testing ya in other words but then you see you you don't leave you don't even leave your name you know you don't leave your name you record uh oh then you go back and you just go there they give you a number then you just quote that number okay okay then after that the government how they're going trace you if you are hiv positive they can't trace you they can't trace you then you you go and say oh i got hiv positive go back and and feel very sad about it but you go on you know you don't undergo counselling no they have counselling they have counselling no how can they undergo counselling when you don't give your name no you can just say oh i i i word  you have to come back and get your results yes when you come back before you go for your testing they'll counsel you because some people go there to test whether whether there's it's alright she's just the more data the better oh ya no but then later on after that they will counsel post-  word pre-test counselling and post-test counselling yes but if you don't leave your name you can't force me to go for counselling right  no they'll counsel you there and then i just seem in the clinic oh there and then ya after that it's up to you oh well
