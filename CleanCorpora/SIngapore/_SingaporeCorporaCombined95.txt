four o'clock ah ya four o'clock ah okay you'll be down at because he didn't call back you see so we can't reach him already oh okay but does he have the budget and all that for the next production or not i don't know lah don't know ah ya ya ya okay okay because the thing is i just want i need need to know roughly how much it'll cost lah i can give you a number lah i think so ah can nuh maybe we can work with that lah ah i think we can ya i think he has something in his head okay we work with that lah  word after the discussion what we can do is uhm maybe type it out tonight and fax it for so you know ya it's like followed by the thing you see ya followed from the meeting and then word  i see so but i don't know whether he has anything uh written uhm ya uh you know that's true lah ya so maybe today in the preliminary kind of thing lah uhm ganesh will be no problem lah no i just he uh he uh he's got some ideas and maybe want to like work out hah work out something uh okay that shouldn't be a problem oh ya before you put down the phone i must inform you ah that uh our conversation is being taped okay no why you're trying out the scene is it ya no why aiyah we have a friend from english department uh huh she's doing a study on singaporean english lah oh okay as as people talk over the phone so unfortunately you have been selected okay for this project and so this conversation has been taped lah okay lah uhm this is all in the name of academia yes  word  so should be no problem ya the person is an ex-teacher who is the ex-teacher she also like us oh i see yes taught and left really uh ya today i just got the the letter from the ministry what acceptance letter is it acceptance of the resignation and that but you have no bond to pay right orh oh no thanking me for my money i paid to them the bond oh you paid not word  how much uh mine mine is about five k start off okay lah that's not too bad lah  word not too bad not i was word  ya anyway you have the freedom lah you have the freedom to do what you want now now uh i agree uh how were the reviews of the word so far okay lah so far i enjoyed the show yesterday uh huh i thought it was quite good yesterday ya okay lah ya so far it's been positive because there are some people can't make the link orh orh orh ya i don't know what the link is lah but i assume it was trying to show that if your foundation not strong in both cases you will collapse or something like that uhm that that that can also ya and some you will have someone that is uh the strong will survive ya you know ya there are so many ya  word someone to link i just want to see the parallel between the two situations lah ya a lot of people left without realising what happened no but uhm what we actually we haven't yet experiment experimented as in asking people two days later uhm uhm you need sometime for it to sink in  word ya lah i told uh we i don't know yet ya if they can come to a realization two days later ya they can still find for me because ya as you're watching it it's just word  ya it may because you're too engrossed with the show right and everything else in it you know ya ya you still don't want them to make the analysis then correct ya but i don't know you see actually it's basically what we're trying to put in of course is entrapment entrapment nuh ya because getting uh because we're thinking of re-staging it so what we want made clearer uhm could be the the you know that the trap lah because  word physically trapped and uh kim kim is trapped by singaporeanness oh i see word   word she got to pay for word i got to go i can't the difficulty of letting go the ya you know alan breaking free going correct ya ranching going out of the house etcetera all a lot of uh and the idea of uh uh death uhm father's death that traps her growth the the the people death that word  ya taxes lah in life in in living in singapore also maybe nuh being trapped by your job uh and you can't word  ya you know actually i think the play itself has a lot to offer i'm i'm glad you're you're planning to re-stage it lah ya i think too many of these plays here get done once and then get shelved and not you know not done again nuh uhm it's a pity ya so we must get the audience who can share uhm after that we you know see how lah see how which part we want okay lah more you know which part because you know the part where they they caught and jean cried out then you know i will die then i can walk through word  ya correct ya you see and so tonight we're going to uh we're make we're making jean say that earlier oh because as the overlay takes place uhm uhm uh audience gets caught up with the effect rather than the content you see i see so we want to put that earlier uh slightly earlier when the word  ya correct that line is often left i mean it loses its impact ya ya correct so maybe it is not that the maybe it's a bit of the script a bit of the delivery uhm uhm uhm so you word with testing the the script out ya i think this' the best time to test whatever you want to do right huh fairly experimental at the moment ya ya  word  but i like i like the show lah i i thought it was quite well produced ya  word the effect the first night my god the audience i know wan hui was telling me the audience were were they were laughing at every line tuesday was a more you know more intelligent audience ya because they followed the play ah the first night they even laughed at the singlish oh god  word so they laughed at everything oh you had the whole of sbc people at the back what friday background sunny lim and all that ya who are there  word  so they were impressed they did ya is it ya what did we do we didn't know about the feedback lah uh because some word i was walking out they were talking to me because they knew i was working oh ya with you ya word whether i knew inside info oh most of them didn't catch the parallel you know most of them didn't ya they enjoyed the acting ya they enjoyed the acting the enjoyed the performance as a whole but the parallels i mean they're intelligent to make correlations lah but you know like never show whether that was what the playwright wanted to come across or director wanted to come across so kind of like that lah never mind lah okay that one that one we can we can we can ya handle lah you know ah please please call me and tell me if uh when the next uh rehearsal is for that one ya ya okay thanks a lot nuh i hope you don't mind this being used for as part of her study uh ya this whole thing uh ya ya she's
