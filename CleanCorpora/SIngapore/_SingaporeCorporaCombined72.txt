i mean knew i would never be able to develop professionally in that place for various reasons you know it may be defamatory to name them so i went and applied and i got a job with david chong and company uh david chong word and partners who were interested in my i p practice and there i continued with whatever i p work i had and uhm i i did uh one or two interesting cases like this copyright infringement case various aspects of which have been reported in the papers and oh by the way i had some of my raids and all that reported in the papers you know i'll show you the newspaper clippings and then and then i so so i got involved in registration copyright you know some documentation and all that and when i applied to this firm i came in hoping to develop my i p practice so basically that was how it went right so uhm you went from this small firm to david chong where you also did i p work and yah yah but now we're here and we both of us have to try and develop the i p practice with our practice head coordinator yes certainly we should try we shall do our best yes and yourself vasantha what would you like to know my years at smith kline ah ya that will be interesting okay aye okay i want to ask you has uh you you did a lot of marketing but has that uhm deaden your sort of diagnostic abilities if you can call it as a pharmacy because you know it's different being practising pharmacy as it is and actually marketing certainly what it is is that initially you get trained for a profession but uhm if you don't work within that profession then you can lose touch you don't lose the training what happens is that you may lose some confidence and you may lose touch with the state of the art of the practice but uh it will not take very much to go back into it i mean you must bear in mind that pharmacy practice is very diverse you got pharmacist who are actually in pharmacy practice in manufacturing in hospitals in retail and uhm within the pharmaceutical industry those within that pharmaceutical industry tend to be far more business oriented and marketing and uh yah business and marketing oriented because they're basically businessmen i suppose it's a more fluid degree to have than something like law it tends to be quite fluid but uh it it yah i would suppose and you can also you've got the scientific training you see so that does i i feel it makes a difference because it it sharpens your mind in analytical skills do you do you think it it it sharpens your skills more than let's say legal training has uh definitely because it's my my scientific training that has helped me to develop my legal skills because i felt that with all due respect to arts graduates i felt that when i was when i was still an arts student uhm are you finding all this very interesting when i was an arts student i dealt with abstracts you know like like when you do a practical criticism of a article and all that and that has helped even now let's say when i view a a a movie you can actually look and see what the nuances are and i enjoyed doing that but you see cecilia the yah yah but le i mean legal training is very different you know and i think my strong arts uhm bent affected my ability to switch you know what i mean because you were in science all along even in school and if there is a marked difference yah uhm although i find that the the legal skills that are required for reasoning and analytical work are very akin to science except that the science is is more precious far more exacting so however analytical you could get with your legal skills and your legal practice you will still never reach the stage that you would truth scientific of truth scientific uhm work yah you see at the end of the day an an chemistry equation is a chemistry equation it's very that's right and it is very exact it is exact down to the last atom for it to be able to function whereas there's always some amount of leeway in in no in in legal practice it can never be exact because you're dealing with changes circumstances and changing times yah yah so i mean no it's not a question of good or bad it's a question of the difference it's a question of the focus yah and it has to be how much more time do we have chris nine minutes hey we didn't do too badly yah so what what else do we need to talk about oh you say you haven't been to sri lanka that would be interesting because i as you know i've married a man who's a singhalese and uhm he is uh i think sec perhaps a third generation singaporean and uhm i i i think that asians nowadays have this dichotomy between them you know about asian identity being which is very tied to their ethnic and racial identity as opposed to national identity and suppose to their influences cultural influences which we have i mean we're a product of uhm colonial times where uhm the language we speak is actually a language foreign to this region don't you think so and i think so the the the the the information that we absorb generally will al always be in the english language okay and that would mean that the source of this information will also be in a way regional from the west and that does that colour our view or does that actually change our perception of who we are i give you an example like the way we dress okay is it considered a western outfit or has it reached the stage where it is international because when in in sri lanka apparently i read that they wanted to establish national identities so they made everybody wear sarongs you know what i mean oh how strange so so what's the link of sarong with sri lanka sarees sarongs you know they wear the how strange but that would be more to establish an identity in malaysia no but i suppose they they have they tie something round their but like like dhotis dhotis perhaps it's called dotees so so do they're saying that wearing pants and wearing skirts and blouses is a western con reinforces the western influence yah yah but does it because if you if you look at it if you look at even england or or europe and all that not everybody dress in jeans and shirts well i think you have a good point there you see the question about all this has got to do with whether which stage the development of the country is at and to what degree the government and the people and the influences of that country choose to view culture and and uhm harmony and identity as a priority i think in this current economic climate uh a lot of governments make the conscious decision that economic factors especially in these times of recession are far more important when there's not enough accordance given to cultural aspects then what tends to happen is that well people muddle along they find their own way and the economic policies override and when the economic policies override your western influences come in because you got your your your your yah your media your investments you got your the countries from which you're gonna be able to uh get the trade and give you know import export so very interestingly now that the western world has opened up so much to the east you'll find that equally be you know they've they've come to the east for economic purposes you look at how england the united states australia everybody is looking at wow the china market the vietnam market the cambodia market you know and the indian market look suddenly singapore who started going off and looking at all these wonderful potential things they could milk from there but singapore is different singapore is still in asia but when it comes to when the other countries start uhm looking towards asia then uhm the economic factors bring in the cultural factors as well and then people start to see do you think it's it's it's so it's could it be economically driven it's not i'm not saying i mean it's seem to be economically driven uh whether the governments give emphasis to cultural things you see once you reached a certain level of of uh affluence affluence then you start to look at things like my identity self-actualization sort of the finer things in life correct whereas because it's gone beyond basic survival yes whereas if you go to places like india okay every once in a while you have this little thing where a cultural thing will arise and people will say and anyway the the cultural influences are still very strong people still have an identity because ninety-five per cent of the population is a certain race you know but the thing is like in india for example where there's been so much western influence and the government had said that there has been but at the same time the government is also so much more interested in the economics of it in developing and you have to because how do you reach a stage where you can say that oh my g d p is this much my per capita income is so much except by improving economically as you know so it's a question of the priority that the country gives to it that that is one way of looking at it but if you look at it from a historical point of view let's say you it it it who in this century all right let's say the last two centuries which are the strong economic powers the westerns you know during the colonial times it was europe it was england you know the great british empire and then in the later part of this century aft especially after world war two it was america yah right so where where where economic strength lies political strength lies with it exert a lot of cultural influence as well you know what i mean like for instance uhm take five hundred years ago they talk about indianisation of this region why because india was so powerful that that there was a lot of trade done in this region through india and india had a way of uh influencing the the religion and the culture so so it is the economic factors which are the driving force if if because comes comes economic power then political power i agree with you i mean i i think essentially that's that's we've agreed on that because it's not that uh the government decides that the cultural if the cultural aspects are going in the opposite direction to the economic aspects i think the economic aspects will overtake yah and then now we have and then and then of course there was china so if you look at let's say a country like thailand and indonesia i mean they're actually quite diverse but at at the same time if you look at the way their script is done the way their dances are and also like their religion and all that it's very much influenced by the philosophies of india then again you to the other extreme well our our pinico is based on the indian pinico  yah but that is i'm talking about over the centuries okay now i think india's influence because right now india is not as influential as when she was lets say two three hundred years ago yes yes before the british came and milked it that's right you know uhm it has its influence is less strong in this region then take china also during china's uh during the times when they were very powerful during the ming dynasty during the the beginning of the ching dynasty the influence they had over japan over korea you know what i mean there's there's there's a general cultural slant that that you know draws its influences from one very strong economic power
