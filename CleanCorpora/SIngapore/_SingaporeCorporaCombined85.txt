must open huh without fail until five o'clock like that you know you mean one day also cannot close at all   they cannot close  ah ah but then again they make a lot of money uhm so it is okay you seem to be enjoying your beef kway teow so much shiok what why the beef is damn nice uhm her beef is damn nice you just buy beef and eat one day yucks yucks your backside uh  giggle yucks  slurp damn nice want some don't want eee i don't take beef why i don't take beef means i don't take beef religious reasons uhm but that doesn't make sense hinduism never stipulated that you cannot eat beef  shut up word  hinduism never stipulated that you cannot eat beef it did where i don't know lah just shut up lah you see it's a cultural concept wait it's not fair you see ah beef was probably not to be eaten in the indian culture because cow gives milk and milk is also given by the mother and therefore cows were compared as sacred to mothers and that's why they say you shouldn't eat cows it's got no religious connotations yah it is associated with siva what no siva himself is just a construct because humans were not able to focus on a particular point uh uhm they cannot pray to the formless so humans created for themselves forms alright therefore just siva is just a fictitious thing from the mind oh i see and there is only one god ain't that right' yah yah and so there is no shiva so you should be able to eat beef well i've been brought up that way no but since it defies logic so you should start eating beef now   uh no i don't want  don't like because you don't like now that's a different reason altogether  no no no  i've been brought up that way yah so now you're not eating beef because you don't  like it   maybe  maybe maybe yah so it is not a religious reason anymore   maybe it is still  why it is lah why where is the logic no there is a logic are you saying hinduism is not logical   word  no it is  word it is it is i'll think of an answer and tell it to you by tonight i just cannot get my words straight   you are vegetarian on thursdays right you are vegetarian on thursdays right yah word  why uh mm because i'm training myself to become a full vegetarian why full vegetarian because i don't like killing animals lah what's the difference between an animal and a vegetarian and a vegetable what do you mean when you uproot a carrot it's actually being killed as well  word actually i don't like eating flesh word  so it's due to a lack of liking that you don't eat flesh uh what lack of liking yah yah then why aren't you a full-fledged vegetarian then aah yah soon soon so why are you eating meat now uh because i've always been eating meat so i can't like  so you like it of course i like it just now you said that you don't eat meat because you don't like it because i don't like it because i don't like the idea of killing an animal animal and and i asked you no more eating flesh because there's a lot of problem that - you didn't say earlier but let's get back to it anyway  word  you said you don't eat meat because you like vegetables and that was your reason now you're saying earlier you said you don't wanna kill animals because you don't wanna kill animals right uh huh yah and i said when you uproot a carrot the carrot dies also and then you state you said that you don't like the taste of meat mm but you're eating meat now and you say you've been brought up that way i'm sorry i'm lost ok let's get start again why are you vegetarian  no need no need no i'm not gonna give up no need x4) no you see you must do things with logic yah ok and hinduism is perfectly a logical religion yah it is you're going to i never denied that fact yah so why you're not eating beef what beef i don't like to eat beef ok ok lah ok lah you don't like yah but there is no religious connotations to not eating beef right there is so if i eat beef i'm not a good hindu is it i never said that what but you're saying hinduism says that you should not eat beef answer answer no answer i answer tonight  so you should start eating beef call me tonight i'll give you an answer don't want to call word to fmish over man sorry woman  hmm ughh char kway teow still nice yah it is he needs people for experiment can get twelve dollars what experiment but i thought he's on leave yah lah he should be back lah quite long right his leave he never put what what
