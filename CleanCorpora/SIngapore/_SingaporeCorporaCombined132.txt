i think we should not start with by comparing with far larger countries with with far greater resources it's always a matter at the end of whether you finally make the profit so these are the first steps and of course there will be failures there are going to be many more failures but we should not be deterred by it but i was going to come back to mr onmae's point that uh we should concentrate on services which of course i think is an area that we should be in fact uh focus on but i do dispute the point that in manufacturing industry we are not competitive in all manufacturing industries if you if you try to uh examine various facets of it there are areas in which singapore will be competitive martin  i think selling out is not the uh right point here i think it's getting yourself a mesh or getting yourself a a group into a bigger base to go into the global market because going global is uh not something that simple as uh what uh kent said earlier that singapore can put itself uh together with the whole region as the capital city but the problem here is we have still this border despite what we talk about the borderless world nations are still nations so there are still barriers but the day might might come as we talk about the free trade uh area where singapore could actually be the capital and as what wee hock said earlier the infrastructure and all the pluses that we have could be made use of uh to our benefit so for singapore companies when we team up with larger uh companies or when you seek the path of a a listing for instance to get more capital is to equip ourselves for globalisation so when you companies uh teaming up or uh selling out to bigger uh group is because of the products that they have that they are ready to globalise and you need to take that path  martin  yah i i i tend to agree with dr onmae that you know there is a need to emphasize the other aspects rather than pure manufacturing if you look at singapore's history where have been good where have we been strong we are good traders we are good builders of domestic we have built a very good lifestyle for ourselves we are good infrastructural people no reason why we shouldn't continue to do these things but i think the more important thing is to emphasize that we are a city state we are not a nation in a sense of a nation having lots of hinterland lots of resources we don't have that we need to compete therefore in narrower areas i don't like the word globalisation i think that's too big a word but i would be very happy say one of our newspapers acquired one of the maxwell group newspaper tomorrow and there's no reason in the world why we shouldn't think about doing that kind of work i think singaporean within our culture there are certain products that can still be globalised i don't see why mcdonalds should be mcdonalds and pizza should be the only globalised food products chinese food noddles uh paos and uh even peking ducks uh singapore food industry has gone into the roasting of ducks for singaporeans let's hope that they go abroad and sell it you know to the russians lots of hungry stomachs out there  martin dr onmae martin  i i think it's a paradox about it in the sense that uh we've been around as a nation in a sense with a free independent identity for about twenty odd years therefore we cling to this need to keep our individualism we keep talking about our ethnic roots but the other point that i think that dr onmae is getting at which is perhaps more important is that we are a city we are competitive with many other cities in the world to do that you begin to move into i suppose this word globalisation where our bankers for instance some of our bankers among the best bankers in the world one of the world's top traders in foreign exchange resides in singapore is a singaporean we have got good accountants we've got good lawyers what we have to do then is to draw the line and say what is needed to keep our identity as singaporean i think our prime minister mentioned you know 'char kway teow' might be the emphasis to what makes us feel singaporean we need to draw the line between what is singaporean and what is the need to keep us competitive as a global city the more we develop this idea of a mobile international urban elite where people move in and out across countries the more we will capture good people coming to singapore and no reason why a a good film director might not one day come to singapore because he likes the lifestyle here and uses this as a base from which to do his business for the a marketing man  martin  i would advise you when you want to globalise to go into that country and hire a bright young guy there who will probably be cheaper and i can still achieve my objective as an entrepreneur  martin  not necessarily within a globalise country and a globalise state come people work for for international companies people work for for salary for word for career goals and so on so long as you manage him properly and there are companies in singapore who have got a lot of offices and operations abroad who hire the locals nothing wrong with that i think there's nothing wrong with that except that we want to give our younger executives more exposure abroad so that hopefully they in time to come may lead other companies may break out on their own and perhaps this is where the contacts of name national values against international competition comes into play partly our singaporeans feel comfortable in singapore but the the common problem that is being state stated is the issue of say things like bilingualism if my child must learn mandarin if i am posted to china i suppose that's not a problem or taiwan but if i were to be posted somewhere else and if my child doesn't pick up enough mandarin then there could be very serious for his future i suppose so i think we have to make a trade-off here in singapore i'm not say that by by reason of this we should give up bilingualism  martin dr onmae martin  i'll like to raise a point that you know for instance our students who go to a country like say the states they do very well there and also many singaporeans do move outside singapore i think your generalisation might be for country as a whole but if you think of singapore as a city with clusters of people i think we can make our executives move a lot out of singapore the policy is less orientated towards elements such as say the educational issue which is linked with national values so i i believe that there are many opportunities for singaporeans to go abroad and that they can survive in the tough competitive world many of our bankers have lived outside and they have done quite well when they went out  dr onmae martin  i think finding the money is one thing the the thing to look at might be that you are talking about two groups of uh business one is for starters so for starters probably you really need seed money where the risk is higher the other group will be for what you said about the 'pao' uh sellers who has already a business going has proven some success and wants to first regionalise so i think that group is where the venture capitals should come in and the at the current state they don't take such big risk probably to look at it and take a bigger risk and actually help them out uh via a packaging a franchise road uh that would might involve uh lesser capital or actually finding them a business partner and i think the thing for singapore businesses to do now is probably to look at alliances look at grouping themselves together and then the seeking the market out because the market place outside is not uh as simple as what kent said earlier during the japanese days where they could uh sell a poorer or more inferior product because the market place at that time is freer the uh market demands for the goods are much larger than today today the competition is different so we should look at singapore now going into the next lap the first twenty-five years is pretty simple  martin  oh during our times as i have said earlier in the early seventies we started in seventy-one the demand is greater than supply and you just need to work a little harder opportunities were plenty today the situation is different at that point in time to start a capital you need to start a business you need very low capital you could actually pass your hat around and get started today you're talking about millions of dollars we started off with uh only twenty thousand dollars so it's a different ball game so we could see that opportunities are no more the same the uh stage of uh development is totally different now i agree with kent we are such a small population base hardly three million so we cannot be champions in everything so maybe  martin  well i i think the test of an entrepreneur is finally his ability to find the money sure bankers have to be conservative i think that and stock exchange have got to abide by its own rules and sure it's going to be very difficult you know but the poor pao maker just have to keep on going around passing his hats and badgering his relatives and looking for companies to buy-out sell-in or whatever i i uh agree with wee hock because at the end of the day the businessman must find his own market must find his own business but can we as a small state make it easier make it uh create the opportunities create the avenues so if i was talking earlier you have this people with bright ideas university students who come out with fantastic projects so entrepreneur in the making now where do they go so maybe in in the singapore's context we have to look for alternative maybe the setting up of an entrepreneurship fund might be useful martin  well when if we have a group or or a individual who has an idea and feel that he could sell coming to this uh committee that's managing a fund for instance  martin  can can i just cut in because uh within the edb during my time we had a lot of experience trying to set up funds hundred million dollar two hundred million dollar the problem is always administering it who do you give to the criterias and the risk of failures i think it should be singapore as a group or the government or the edb or whoever should provide the necessary incentives to overcome not to overcome the risk but to make the risk worth taking so some incentives must come for globalisation one particular one will be to implement maybe a a reverse tax incentive ten years since we give ten year pioneer status for companies to come here why not give ten year pioneer status to companies who go abroad if they are taxed abroad then that tax should be deductable against local word  it's a reverse pioneer status  dr onmae martin  i think that uh the attitude towards failure doesn't sorry i think kent's trying to come in  dr onmae martin i think he's got a point the point is that uh for singapore to grow bigger and the government having played a very large role in singapore you'll find that the more you want to go into the international competitive area the smaller the role the the government plays or should play or should be playing and maybe this is an important consideration we have developed a host lieu of government-linked companies
