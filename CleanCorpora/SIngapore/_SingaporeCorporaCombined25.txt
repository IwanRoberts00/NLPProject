that they were not informed and they were not happy about not being informed no no no this letter in the forum page okay and this guy got's a valid very valid point that what's the point of having pass with merit it should be a finer distinction like distinction and then ordinary pass that's all because they don't know what pass with merit means at all how can you say it's not been classified right properly ya it's not been properly told it's not well thought of uh that whole scheme no and they implement it without actually you know uh any publicity informing anybody about it right so even the future the potential employers ah will not even know what what it means what difference it makes if i employ it's just suddenly implemented yes in fact students here somebody from uhm a parent call me up and and ask me uh can they start applying for honours immediately since the daughter got pass with merit oh then i said no it does not mean automatic uh automatic entry you see ya so they're very proud of their children getting pass with merit shouldn't they word  oh poor disillusion people yes we have about five six minutes to go let's give him ten minutes after all we're not

paya lebar upper serangoon junction so did you go to word   word  no robin did not invite me oh i see did he invite all the branch people no i'm not so sure who he invited i think he should lah uhm because usually for wedding for church wedding usually the person can invite many people oh you mean the whole company uh it's unlike the wedding dinner which you have to pay more oh but sometimes it's because they they also have a quota because they church cannot accommodate so many people your relatives and your church friends your church your church friends will take up maybe hundred over
