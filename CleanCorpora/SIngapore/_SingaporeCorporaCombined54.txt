what this is most unnatural right can you uh can you speak as well you can't we try to manage aye you going into word straits times or newpaper uhm straits times ya straits times which beat do you know which beat you'll be doing i've no idea because i i i haven't met them yet you see tomorrow will be first time but i suppose it's gonna be just one interview unless uhm unless they want me to see somebody else no have they already uhm told you that you're accepted is it or no no no it's it will be oh an interview i see tomorrow it be a last hurdle i suppose ah ha ah ha it's just that i i went for the test okay ya a lot of people leaving that's why uhm i suppose it's quite high ya the attrition rate is very high but not as high as sbc lah sbc is worse sbc ya i suppose so but the let's not be bothered by this okay just treat it very informal ya he's the one know who's making everything so how's life okay haven't seen you for years ya since raffles hall days right i think so ya you were at raffles hall right weren't you i was i was but your you went into teaching right still teaching what our frank told us you quit well st is my ticket out of teaching when it happens lah you know pauline right which pauline from newpaper pauline as in pig-tail pig-tail one oh okay ya i know i just bump into her uhm at wesley church uhm i think she's full-time with uhm with uhm a church not wesley we we met there for a seminar she's working she's a full-time worker ya serious ah ya so unlike her is it ya are you are we talking about the same pauline or ya pig-tail pauline uh specki glasses ya very uh looks like she came from china very jumpy uh very bubbly sort of  word class ya ya ya ya it must be her lah anyway ya it's her newpaper oh she is there you were there together right for a while that's good ha ya ya we were who left first you right i left first she's back she was there i think about four years i think she joined them when they started ya i was there with them when they started too  word were doing the launch right and everything ya we were doing the launch he she was with me she was with me through uh out through ya school of journalism and all ha but i heard that it's quite bad about what school of journalism of course why it's fallacy doesn't teach you anything well in that case they should scrap ie too it's a bigger fallacy ya ya correct i i can't i think uhm i think ie is worse i hope this is not going to be like you know uhm actually taken against us you know because the i don't know lah i i really couldn't stand it you know i were you there i was i was i told them this is it this is the last straw you know why a friend of mine and i went we wanted to hand in this assignment early you know because the date due was something like twenty-ninth of april that's going to be a problem because most of us wanted ya we wanted to submit early right you know our our the the department told oh you can't you we don't know where to put it please come back on the twenty-ninth ya the the tray the box or something is not here yet you know can you imagine is it rita skuya uh it wasn't no because when you submit you submit through the administration you know ha ha if you remember your sub you submitted but you see they are they are given like different secretaries you see to to handle ya ya ya i noticed that i don't know which which uh secretary i can't remember her lah i noticed she had a space crisis but no that's so silly isn't it don't you have to serve the bond right ha i escaped it i didn't sign it i left before i signed it just before i signed it so how long were you in ie about three months i think it's about three or four months right before you enough to to fiddle to know what's it feel to know ya oh that's crazy i mean you know there was this lesson that we go through that they teach you how to make transparency ah and oh how to use the blackboard that's the worst how to use the chalk how to use the blackboard that was like i skip the lesson uh please divide into four then can you write in this fashion word or not ya ya ya but how could you skip i skip i skip lessons oh you skip lessons ah because you see we have the benefit of like past uhm student past year student telling us about what to skip you see so ya and we were the guinea-pigs what what we've to go through the whole everything what batch were you eight-seven 1987 that's the year you graduated ya that's the last year right without bond uh no no no there is a bond but you know it's sign mid mid way through the course it's not right at the beginning no but at our time they make us sign right from beginning oh they got smart no lah but 1987 was a very bad year if you remember so there were a lot of people applying to to to what about newpaper how's it newpaper ah newpaper was fun if if i had to go back to full-time work again i think if i had my way that would be the best so you left primarily because of your because i got married you know how you you are you're going to be ready right for the horrible hours but excuse me this is the this is the you know we we're even to have a book publish on women women in singapore uh most women about the other women ya most women are ya most women are like you know either they're single no lah or they're you know they're let me tell you lah in straits times most women are either single divorced married again or they're not straight or they're not straight that's quite true so far i'm telling about us from reporters you know ya the the the sub-editors are not like that because they lead pretty regular grave-yard hours you see because they're always on grave-yard so they can at least have some order to their lives you must be prepared because there was one stretch where i was working nine to twelve midnight nine am twelve midnight nine am twelve for four days in a row that's when i after i've done it was exhilarating and all that you see if you're on a high you can't sleep at night you know imagine going back at twelve and you've just finished this glo glorious story you know you can't sleep so you know it's very very unhealthy i decided i mean it's not fair what if i'm going to get married to put someone through all that ya that's true lah there was this woman who perpetually had her husband waiting outside but you see not all husbands can do that know and is it fair or not to ask all husbands do that for you even if yours did it it will come a point where it's too much you know he says it's too much ya can you imagine she he would sit you know she would be typing her story he'll sit right before are we finished no she he can sit there for four hours you know i think to a certain extent teachers too during term time lah but at least we have a lull you know like during the break ya uh they go on holiday you know no there is no such thing as a lull if you're a good reporter there's never a lull ya so maybe you know you can say that you pace yourself but if you're a good reporter you can never let a story go you know that's true that's true so how how how could you ya you still dancing or not uhm a bit lah not not not so much ya this is suppose you pig to mine chris yes so long were you there newpaper i was there about two and a half years three years two years that's quite long long enough lah you know word  the but it's a very it's very enjoyable as a single it's okay but if you are thinking of marrying i don't think it's very a healthy life that's true even as a single it's a very all consuming thing right isn't it ya it is it is and you get jaded very fast you get very cynical there was it came to stage where you know about what people life life in general ya you mean you you get this jaded that when people call in and say oh there's an accident along paterson road then you know someone will ask very casually anybody died or not nobody died ah forget it so many vehicles i suppose it's just like doctors right after a while you know ya ya ya it's like you dis you know you could dissect someone eating char kway teow or something like a friend of mine sheng kwai was telling me that he has got this friend not friend lah you know bb boy he became a houseman and you know being christians and know that they're supposed to be compassionate compassionate but after a while it's like you know treat it like another person another patient you know i mean it's another body  word  to cure ya i mean when you're especially when you're covering say the midnight hours can you be imagine how much word  do you have when you're like half asleep and some patients are very difficult same thing lah that's true so i got to i realize lah that i that's not what i want to become you see you look around you know and you of course there are people who survive if you're talking about christians there are quite a number of very you know strong christians in journalism yes there are but very few of them i suppose chong jin will be one of them chong jin are you kidding chong jin is the wayward one but he was i mean he was he was like ra ra all fire you know no he's not anymore that that scared me i also saw him you know going that way it you know we used to look up to him like some sort of mo role model because he was one of those who was very uhm he was zealous but not to the extent where he he you know like i i don't know how you describe him no he strike one as a very balanced who's really who lead a very strong moral fibre it's no longer so no but you know you see him fall and he himself has no regrets you know i think from the way he speaks the way he talks about it it's like it's this one aspect of life and he his uh his religion has become a philosophical thing so it was very scary we were you know we we did talk quite a bit when we were in there so it scares you radiant i'm not sure i mean i'm just buying a do you know i just accept this as buying a ticket out of what i'm doing now which school are you teaching at ahmad ibrahim ha ahmad ibrahim secondary school that's like way in jurong uh that's what everybody thinks it's not ah it's eventually uh in uh yishun yishun it used to be in upper thomson road but they moved oh ya it's just one of those things lah named after the it's suppose to be the first malay minister but it's a very difficult school isn't it it's not not notorious not really it's supposed to be a the better school in the north north really why do i always have this impression that it's one of those difficult schools because of the name maybe ahmad ibrahim you know like sunila utama i don't know how the students ever live that down sunila utama i come from sunila i hope they think of a change you know ya i mean there're so many schools named after roads you know what i mean so silly there's going to be an ang mo kio avenue two school something very soon ya but your school's not good enouh to be named after somebody like somebody substantial but i suppose i think you've always been the kind of person who wants everything in life ya i suppose i don't think you'll settle just for a career ya i don't think so it's it gets to you know after awhile you you realise that a lot of the so-called strong women there you you observe them you know they ya their career is everything it's all consuhming that i think to ex word they think they're so emanci emancipated and you know they are not uhm they they're their own person and all actually they're not there're actually slave to their work they're strong because they have no other choice you see what are the alternative i mean if they if they don't act strong they have to admit that oh oh they have chosen the wrong path or ya ya i mean i have known so many s b c producers i mean like uhm i mean even millie who are okay i mean not not sort of like it doesn't sound like our sub-cultural groups lah like you know but normal women who are very feminist but deep down they still have this problem urge with their emotional dependence i ya i've never been a feminist i think depends on what you mean by feminist i mean you can be a feminist without losing your essential femaleness you know so at the end of the day you're made to need somebody ya so if you deny that then you deny that part of yourself you know because a lot of the editors uh are all of course they are all children of the sixties lah no not children of the sixties i think they went throuh the sixties in their teenage years you know so for them you know feminism is such a burning thing but i think in their late later years now like they're in their thirty-nine and forty they start to realise that maybe they've gone wrong but it's too late to admit it isn't it without losing every you know it takes a lot of to admit maybe without without making sound like you've made a mistake i think that's a sad thing i mean look at pat chan i you still think she's a victim of her own achievements you know i think she has achieved so much you can't even live it down it's like how can i ever like you know going for a man you know what is it that he has that i don't you know special organs why do you think word  she's gonna fix the organs as well because i think she's not really i don't know i mean i know her as a person but she's a very charming person you know she likes to dress up you know she likes to you know everytime there's anything new at issey miyake she will go and buy but she'll only scarves and shirts i find you know what i mean she's not really i don't think she's i mean more new word you know but i thouht she was a the reason why she became like that was her father injecting her with hormones
