""
""
now you were interviewed sometime ago uh by the business times
i believe
""
i think it's called the conversation at raffles and you made some
very very
""
""
that's right
""
""
uh shall we say very remarkable statements if i might say and
the pardon me for putting on my glasses i would like to quote from what
you've said
""
you said that there are three priorities for the malay muslim
community in singapore
""
to develop a singapore brand of islam to become active and even
proactive players in forging an enhancing religious harmony in the country
and to maximise the community's economic potential and you went on to include
malays to become must become more self confident to reach beyond the
community and to want to do better
""
uhm i suppose these are fairly self-evident truths and they are very
logical and non-controversial
""
but what made you to put those principles in such stirring terms
""
i mean is there a need for that uh uh uh in malay community
""
""
you know while we've as as a community the malay muslim
community in singapore has been through difficult times
""
i saw it first to know that in in in in three decades actually post
independence
""
we first started off by feeling that you know that almost like
everybody else owe us a living
""
""
that's rather strong oh boy
""
""
yes and we thought that uh we're sort of sons of the soil we
and and it's true actually not only of singapore malays but also practically
of uh many developing countries achieving independence particularly in this
area we felt that you know yah we we started this pointing
""
""
special yah
""
""
we started pointed fingers at others
""
you owe us this you need to do this for us and i i'm reminded
actually when i was in jakarta last week i had the same example i used
""
i was reminded by a javanese that you know when you point a finger
someone it's only one finger but with three others pointing
""
""
pointing yourself yes
""
""
yourself well i was told by this javanese that in in the malay
or indonesian way of pointing a finger is this way where you point one finger
at others but four
""
""
inside
""
""
fingers pointing at yourself and i and we start thinking that
you know is that really worthwhile every time pointing fingers at others
""
but let me quickly add to say that the malay muslim community has
never been uhm short on uh self-help activities
""
but uhm it took sometime before we felt that we must work within
the national framework
""
""
yes
""
""
and and in the eighties when we felt we formed mendeki
""
in fact it's a combination of many years of social activism which
bought the various groups together
""
and i think uhm mendeki has shown what we can achieve and what we
can do if we sink our differences put our shoulders to the wheel and mind you
hard work real hard work must come with it and and i made an example
""
""
may may may i cut in
""
""
yes
""
""
may i cut in on this one
""
you mention one phase which caught uh which caught my ears sink our
differences
""
are there really significant differences or superficial differences
within the community
""
""
well our history has been filled with that and fortunately we
came to realise that you know we just cannot go on uh with all this
differences and i think unity is i think is uh critical
""
and i'm glad we have that now more than before and that way we can
actually maximise our resources
""
""
i would like to sort of uh put something to you which may be a
misconception uh on the part of many people in singapore including myself
that's that there is a perception of the fundamental conflict between
religion the islamic religion of the islam and modernity if you agree that
adjustments uh and accommodation have to be made between these two factors
whether it is in fact uh possible to make successful uh uh integration in the
long term
""
""
can i uh preface my answer to that question by adding a point
to my earlier answer and to say that there are problems
""
i hope i have not painted a too rosy a picture about uh the process
of upliftment and to say that there are problems
""
and one of the problems is this question of reconciling differences
in terms of perception
""
""
yes
""
""
i think there's a serious gulf of perception between the
malays non-malays and muslims non-muslims and the it's not because of
religion but it's because of how muslims practice their religion
""
if i may cite an example
""
i was in libya in nineteen seventy-three
""
i was a student there and i was invited to attend an international
conference and we went there happily looking forward to a model of islam
""
""
a simple answer
""
""
yes
""
""
looking for a simple answer
""
""
in fact in fact it was proposed that uhm communism had failed
capitalism had failed and the answer is the third international theory called
the green book islam
""
""
oh yes yes i read about that yes
""
""
and uh but i must say that we came back very disillusioned
very disappointed because even at that very conference we saw those
contradictions we saw those uhm weaknesses and mind you that's within the
fold of islamic brotherhood within the fold of islamic conference youth
conference full of hopes and expectations
""
and i that made me feel why is it that we muslims in singapore must
always look to one particular area be it middle east or somewhere else
""
""
yes
""
""
for that reference points
""
i agree that the cradle  word  of islamic
realisation was mecca and for a long time middle east was in fact the
reference point
""
but we are different we are urban we are industrial we are global
""
but i'm not saying that we we don't have those cultural and
religious pools whether in the region or in the context of the international
omma the muslim
""
""
yes
""
""
but i think uh with our own uh needs and our own challenges we
must find new reference points which will provide us those kind of answers
where is more relevant to our need
""
i'm not saying that uh they are so many islam there is only one
islam
""
""
yes
""
""
but let me also add to say that why is it that we have
differences in in practices in all over the muslim world
""
but
""
""
okay okay we got to take a commercial break now but i like to
leave something with you uh we can chat about it uh later on
""
uhm perhaps what i'm trying to to to put to you is that surely
there is not a zero sum game as far as this is concerned i i would imagine
that even within the the boundaries of the islamic faith uh one doesn't have
to consider that if you in fact uh exist and succeed in the secular society
you do have to trade off something
""
uh we'll come back to you later on
""
and don't go away now we'll be back and where i'm gonna put that
question to zainal once again
""
see you later
""
""
welcome back before we took the commercial break i was putting
the question to zanial as to whether religion and modernity is a zero sum
game may i have your views on this one zainal
""
""
let me say that it must be a win win situation for us there's
no other way
""
there will be difference some matter of perception some reality and
uh i think we got to learn to manage those differences
""
i say a win win situation because islam calls for modernity islam
calls for progress and islam calls for tolerance
""
you know islam is a very multi-cultural society in fact and i think
uh i'd see no reason why islam cannot uh succeed in a secular state like
singapore and i would like to say that singapore gives us all the challenges
to be good muslims
""
it's not gonna be easy but the challenges are there and it's up to
us actually to work
""
""
this is a very interesting set of uh facts
""
why is it that the people in general don't seem to know these i
mean from appearance anyway and from what one hear as in these these not the
issues that are often front-ended to any discussion
""
uh one tends to see much more uh uh back to the nature sort of
thing but why why is that so
""
""
well i think uhm there is historical baggage we can't deny
that whether for cultural reasons racial reasons or religious reasons there
have been those there have been those times where it it really does not help
but uhm i'm optimistic and i'm confident that we will be able to make some
headway
""
we have been making headway and i think there's better willingness
on the part both or both malays non-malay muslims and non-muslims to reach
out and learn from each other
""
let me site one another example if you don't mind bob
""
""
please please do
""
""
i went to a forum
""
""
yes
""
""
and i was on the panel and i was uh a chinese gentleman stood
up and say you know what the problem with you all is that you are muslims
""
if you are malays you are alright can you imagine that
""
""
does he really know what this is
""
""
i i mean i thought at first it was very uh facetious but i
thought and thought about it and i thought that this it reflects a very
serious problem
""
because i think quite a lot of non-malays here see malays as very
gentle very easy going people
""
but how did they look at islam
""
how do they look at muslims
""
perhaps overseas fundamentalists radical militant
""
""
they're the guys who grab the headlines
""
""
problems everywhere
""
""
i mean they're the guys who grab the the headlines you see but
there could be a certain amount of concern a certain amount of uh ignorance
""
uhm perhaps this is the gulf that m u i s uh uh would you see this
to be uh uh a gulf that m u i s should attempt to address
""
""
you know i if i may again uh site another anecdote you know
""
i remember when the debate about g r c was on and i remember if i'm
not mistaken that captain ho who had made a submission and was saying that we
should not go for g r c because it gave the malays or the minority groups a
certain political leverage and i remember senior minister or prime minister
then you know prime minister you ask him where do you live
""
i think is was hougang if i am not mistaken and he said do you have
malay friends
""
do you know the malays and the muslims and he said no
""
and i think that's the point and i feel uh the more of muslims
reach out to understand what the others feel and similarly the if more
non-muslims try to reach out and understand how muslims and malays feel i
think there can be that greater uh understanding
""
""
zanial if i may out to push you a little bit on the last
comment that you made i would like to share with you perhaps rightly or
wrongly two perceptions
""
first is that the malay community uh has been marginalised in the
development of the singapore society
""
the other thing is that ever since singapore's independence some
thirty-eight odd years ago the rest of the society has in fact moved forward
""
do you think that the last thirty years have been wasted
""
""
marginalised may be too strong a word
""
you know i remember that quite a number of malay friends of mine
who were very upset when uh we say that the malays were not in the mainstream
""
they feel that the malays have been part of the mainstream
""
""
yes
