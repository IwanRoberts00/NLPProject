i'm going to use what kirpal singh used yesterday and unfortunately he's not here to see this to hear this he's a friend and and an old classmate i'm i'm going to use this thing if ever it exists called a publisher's licence which was what kirpal singh used yesterday when he referred everything to poetic licence uhm i have the unadulterated unqualified luxury this morning of making a vote as a publisher on whether you know you could produce a book of standard singapore english as a dictionary ah and without uh having to ask whether you would like to find exit or not or whether you would like to work as part of it but first of all my vote and then what i'd like to do is after i've told you what i ah how we feel as a house in respect of uhm the existence of us a dictionary of standard singapore english i'd like very much uhm to consider its usage how it would be done how it could contribute or not contribute to i think it would contribute to the development of fiction singapore fiction singapore creative writing and in a wider scope south-east asian writing which is the field that we are particularly interested in and how it would uhm uh play its role in the creativity and the originality as a development of such writing and eventually whether it would assist this kind of writing travel it's over and good to say that i would like to use a word shiok but it's not much good if your word shiok is not as understood as the word in jewish writing uh you know i think you would all of us who want to write or who are publishers writing one type of writing to export and to travel can you hear me at the back and then finally what i would like to say is i'd like to say i'd like to postulate and uhm if i can within the 10 minutes susan has allocated uh i ask you if you feel that this notion of singapore writing can itself in itself take its place amongst some very large movements of writing that has hit that has its it's absorbing the minds of english language uhm publishing and english language writing in in the western world particularly in english language writing in america and in english language writing in uk and continental europe and in australia and new zealand but first my vote and of course we would like to see the existence of a dictionary of singapore english secondly what we would particularly interested in is the fact that it would act if it were produced in the same original size of the marquarie dictionary as a standard or a touchstone and a comparative one we hope against british english and american english and oh what i would like to see is but it would act as a touchstone for us uh uh a basis of comparison uhm a use of measure and in many ways if a kind of standard or or albeit whether it has to be updated or not of how english has been used in this region and i wouldn't entirely like to confine that to singapore because a large amount of the writing as some of the researches have noted have come from malaysia and south-east asia in the region in particular in english language writing or english language translations of dutch or indonesian writing in the early days but i think an unqualified yes because we would like to see for example its etymology as simon so rightly pointed out and we'd like very much for it to be part and parcel of the cultural identity and something that is absorbing the minds of many people in the government but this dictionary we feel uh would contribute in great extent to that identity and uhm that notion of what kind of what i'm a singaporean but what is a singaporean and we feel that that would go a long way towards contributing to that in the development of fiction writing in singapore would the last ten or fifteen years early english language writing began with the british of course you know and with a large amount of their impressions their nostalgia their their feelings about uh south-east asia the chinese and the singaporeans here now though in the last eight or ten years we ourselves you know in the pursuit of singapore writing and south-east asian writing have been publishing and we have within our editorial ru uhm room will tell have had great disagreements about what we can publish what we will publish what we can and will not accept and we've uh we have ourselves seen us change our points of view haven't we our opinions on the use of uhm what i've learnt yesterday was called a borrowing and i'm all for the usage of borrowing uhm we have borrowed from malay and chinese what i'd loved to see is to see us borrow from the dutch to a great extent like a word like or even from mandarin which uhm which i think in the longer run would be a language that would give you a uh greater amount of degree of sensibility and uhm and and sensuousness and a greater length of poetic language that you can use uhm much more than say malay could you know down the road but i think a a dictionary if produced would lend itself and uhm would be a useful tool and a useful touchstone in that particular area the next question really to ask ourselves is uh whether words like or words like sayang which was used yesterday uh would enter in the english language the way a word like serendipid uh serendipity does uh we're hoping that would happen but down the road if that is to happen uh your book your story your fiction your writing your singapore writing has to travel has to export uhm it has to would be exported and be backed by either a publisher or a house or an institution in in the national market that is not our own i'm not sure if that would work at the moment i uhm i see some positive signs although i think it would be gradual and it will grow in concentric circles from the region but i hope that singapore would be the nucleus of this sort of of idea finally the important thing to think to think about is uhm singapore writing using standard singapore english whether it would be whether we would could consider that down the road it could be a corpus i'm not immediately now but could it the kind of corpus that african writing is the jewish writing is in america or indeed that overseas american born chinese writing is grabbing america now i think those were the issues uhm that i would consider and within me and us in particular uhm as a fiction house  now thank you anne i think that you know when the time comes to organise wicc2 uh you may consider an additional question to the list of things to ponder and i would like to suggest this question do you want the anti-climax of a standard closing address at the end of the workshop and if the answer is a resounding no i think it will come as a great relief to me  laughs  but since i have uh receive your marching orders so to speak i shall have to press on somehow uh in my singaporean fashion now ladies and gentlemen you may recall that at the opening of this workshop uh dr ban kah choon began by referring to the movie the terminator and its science fiction terminology well now at this final session i find myself playing terminator to this workshop perhaps i should say terminator 2 since i'm only a stand-in for the director a/p ong jin hui who is uh presently out of town which explains why a political scientist has been called upon to make the closing speech at a workshop on lexicography well the day before the start to this workshop i was actually on the borneo side now of the south china sea basin coordinating or rather helping to wind down a workshop on regional security in the post cold war concept it seemed to me at the time that a lexicography workshop couldn't have been more distant from our preoccupation with great power politics but having sat through some very interesting and fascinating sessions of this workshop i must say that i have learned a lot uh from the remarkable similarity between the underlying issues and uh i am beginning to hope that more of my colleagues in political science could have been here at one level we at this workshop have been reflecting on the fragmentation of empire in this case the fragmentation of the language of an empire without making it too explicit we have touched on the international phenomenon of pluralization and the drift towards regionalization and multiplurality there is also an unmistakable ideological dimension to the ostensibly simple question of whether there ought to be a dictionary of singapore english the rhetoric of those who forcibly argue for a change in the ground rules whether ground rules governing the selection of words for inclusion or the ground rules of right pronunciation all that rhetoric is reminiscent of the rhetoric of the north-south debate and having listened to the comment by dr this morning i am intrigued to compare the fate of english with other international languages do other empires strike back to rebind the language that is increasingly regionalized i wonder what would have happened if the french rather than the british were the colonisers of singapore will we now be renovating in style our dominant language the way the vietnamese are renovating their economy a point was made that eight years ago a project such as this would have been quite unthinkable yet others have observed that this effort at corpora building reflects an aspect of national assertiveness greater confidence maybe national identification maybe even a growth uh of a middle-class while agreeing that ideology should not stand in the way of progress i think we should nevertheless be conscious that many of the questions that revolve around the central issue of a dictionary of standard singapore english has political implications or connotations why should we have such a dictionary in the first place perhaps that question has already been overtaken uh by the events of this very workshop but then we shall have to ask who should have a hand in deciding what should be included what is such a dictionary intending to serve is it to be simply a record of regional english within a particular multi-cultural setting at a particular period of time the kind of zoo or supermarket situation that we were reflecting about or is it to be the final arbiter of what is acceptable singapore english here in lies the issues of official status respectability and legitimacy things that political scientists are very fond of talking about then again we can ask what other implications of such an enterprise for those in other disciplines who have the great essays written in english to be sure ideology must not stand in the way of progress but i am also reminded that those who cannot read the writing on the wall must pay for their political illiteracy whichever way we go from here the fact remains that there is a wide spectum of interests in the subject of this workshop and this is clearly indicated by the very strong representation of the government sector in particular the ministry of education the private publishing sector our sister institutions of higher learning ntu nie relc ngee ann poly and so forth  and also of course that bastion or outpost depending on how you look at it of english the british council of course one can say that this is the kind of subject that everyone in the arts and social sciences and beyond should be interested in language afterall is the indispensable currency of social interaction but it takes a specialist and a particular kind of specialist to tell us how to structure dictionary entries for discourse particles like what and lah and lor and nei and in the course of an afternoon we were also exposed to transitivity structures we considered mood adjuncts and delve into the meaning of finite verbal operators side by side by other exotica like theme rheme and mood residue fortunately we were told though in a quite different context don't be concerned by the complicated appearnace of these terms however simple words can also be rendered ambiguous by the social cultural context i think and this can be particularly maddening in the language of intra-asean diplomacy a colleague of mine who was here this morning but uh who is no longer here is fond of recounting a recet incident in which the malaysian prime minister mahathir attempted to solicited to solicit support for his eastasia economic group idea from president suharto the reply from the indonesian president i will look into it which in the javanese cultural context was as good as saying no perhaps we can reflect on this kind of cross-cultural perception in our next dictionary of asean english but whether we go on to bigger things or settle for a dictionary of standard singapore english or one covering malaysian-singapore english the important thing is that with this workshop we have at least taken a tentative first step and here i am pleased that the cas has in some very modest way been able to support a very useful project i should also uh acknowledge in this connection the financial contribution given by john wiley & sons i would like to thank susan butler for sharing her marquarie experiences with uh with us and for her very active contributions uh to the department of english language & literature special thanks uh for its consistent and strong support and also of course i should acknowledge the untiring work uh of our co-ordinator anne pakir i think after this workshop she should at least have the confidence that when she goes back to the cas for furhter support and we say we will look into it she needs only interprst that in the singapore cultural context thank you ladies and gentlemen
