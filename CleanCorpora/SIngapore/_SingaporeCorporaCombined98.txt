i have to work start reading from scratch it'll probably take me about three have you read any of her works at all ya i read all her books already i just haven't read the critical readings lah ah hah

they trying to get a flat uh queenstown they haven't been successful actually they book one already and then and the i don't know suppose to be like ready in three years lah in fact actually they have gotten the flat but it's just not ready yet ya and then also like she is living on her own now now that her auntie is not there anymore gone gone away so she's there alone nah ya and then i think also

science right ya she's in science ya is the science department quite far from the arts department i'm not sure i haven't i have never seen it lah oh fine so actually haven't gone out much with my friends lah but uhm on my own i've gone out quite a bit uhm you know i've been sick as well ya then how is the rottweiler oh okay but he seems to be having a skin problem how come don't know his he keeps biting and biting ya i think he is allergic to something lah uhm but he's good lah because like having a big dog uh after a long time we've had you know just a small dog and then we our other dog you know pepsi ya after pepsi died then we only had one dog so i thought it seems my mother is at home all all the time and none of us are in so my brother brought uhm a rottweiler lah ya ya you mean it takes what it really looks after the house ah ya but when he first came here rod you know we're disturbing my brother we said he bought a kitten instead ya ya it didn't bark at all ya but now he's he's a good watchdog lah ya ya but i guess also it is so hot nah he tends to be quite uhm quite run down lah i see how come ya because the heat i think the heat gets to him he he wants to come in all the while
