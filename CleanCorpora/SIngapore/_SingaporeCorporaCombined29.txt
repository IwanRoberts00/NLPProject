about port dickson  word  port dickson is just symbolic port dickson is just uhm a port what by the sea so i don't know you can weave a favour from them uh ya today i was in the library saw this book myths and legends in of singapore published by vj times who got things like got chapters like pulau hantu haven't read it yet though is thomas interested in this sort of myths ya oh beside the middle ages more european based i think more european based ya like what sort don't know word stuff scandinavian stuff the english stuff okay uh chinese stuff he knows a bit but not singaporean stuff really oh ya 'a' uh do you know where i can get the dream of the red chamber i want to borrow is it in the library yes it is in the library i want to read it cos' my friend says it's beautiful a few a few volumes you know not only one ya he read three volumes all of them uhm uhm ya they have it in the library he told you read it he says it's very easy to read because you get in tune with the culture you see straight away really have you watched that liao tai show on tv on saturday what's that the ghost no no who acted sylvia chang that show is it no no no the liao tai series it's a series every saturday afternoon about at about four o'clock or so no i never watch at four o'clock i'm giving tui tuition oh ya ya a lot of spirits and ghosts kind of thing you watch uh no i don't unfortunately then how do you know about it i only watch the trailers oh they have these women who who take some potion to seduce men things like that and they appear with the cloth fly fly fly drug the men ya it's about time right i think we shall make a move  uh muslim laws lah which means that uhm for example uhm anyone is caught drinking word  uhm uhm he could be could be uh uh what you caned hor they're going to make it state law is it ya they're going to make it state law applicable  word to non muslims and uhm uh things like a thief or a robber would be uh amputated  word  i suppose it's alright lah if they apply i mean to but they want to they want to apply to non-muslims as well unless unless non-muslims have their own uh laws which word  they have own laws ya which are which would prescribe punishment ya but how about the present laws the present laws are not the they are not enough are not uh uhm implemented by religious groups implemented by the state ya but why must they be implemented by religious groups  word  people who are not part of the religion well that's part of the discussion now lah whether it should include muslims or non-muslims and uh word  ya but then it starts there you know very likely i mean if it succeeds there you know very likely it will ya ya national government word at first nation did say that it will not support uh such course 'cos malaysia is a multi-racial multi-religious secular state but later it uh changed its its opinion at least in the reverse and said that it would conditionally support the people as long as you apply to muslims i think that's fair i mean i mean word  muslims i mean it's fair what for for muslims to have muslim laws but word wants it to apply to ah but there are some groups that actually not not all you know like who word muslims no no not not so much word islam other uh muslim groups but ya but they are muslim groups right word  some of them will say that other people should suf i mean of course i mean of course if they word themselves they suffer most of it lah which like me uh word  so how many sherlock holmes' stories have you... no kid which one is your favourite one actually i like the one where i think it's three cables right actually it was not the crime word word three grapes three cables i thought it was three sisters that was the three cables where got three sisters the house is called three cables where old woman sits in house ya son he was her son used to be very handsome and all that and stuff uhm but he died suddenly uhm then he sent his beloved home to her a few chests and stuff and then and uhm when his mother received word uhm people started to want to buy the house and muhm was not word oh formerly it was owned by a antique it was actually the woman it was actually that woman who wanted just to retrieve something in the word  not the woman the man well the the the thing is the the actual person who wanted to retrieve anything at all was the woman whom uhm he had a bad affair with so he wrote about her in a book which was what they were after all the time
