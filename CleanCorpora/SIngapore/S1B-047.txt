in cuba politics of staying of alive and watching television
how it may be the best thing for malay students all these and more in the

hello and welcome to am singapore i'm shanji dabarachaji
""
the latest ceasefire the eighth in the croatian conflict appears to
be still holding out and well this may have given the negotiators time for
both sides to broker for a more lasting peace that time may be running out
""
although the yugoslav armed forces have agreed to lift their
blockade of seven ports in return for an end to a croatian siege they haven't
however agreed to withdraw from croatia
""
also at six o'clock this morning there were reports of mortar
clashes in the eastern croatian towns of  word  and
 word 
""
given such ceasefire violations peck siok lian asks steven 
word  whether the people who put their names to the agreement
actually had any control over the forces on the ground 
""
sp 
""
""
well the ceasefire agreement seems to have avoided a major
issue by not making any mention of the croatian demand for a total withdrawal
of federal troops from the republic
""
does this mean that there will be uh negotiations leading to a
re-drawing of the internal boundaries of yugoslavia 
""
sp 
""
""
but uh by not going along with the croatians don't you feel
that uh the serbians are in fact adamant on making uh herself the dominant
republic in yugoslavia and therefore uhm working towards what has been called
the greater serbian nation

socialism or death
""
well that rather ominous question was fidel castro's defence of
communism
""
but when a country hold its fourth party congress later today the
question is one of survival the survival of a dying breed of orthodox
socialism and the survival of a castro regime
""
when the two thousand or so delegates meet today their main task is
to draw up a blueprint for the island socialist system rather than dish out
magical remedies for the crumbling cuban economy
""
 word  is chief of a hispanic division at the us
library of congress in washington d.c.
""
producer tan yong meng asked him how the recent announcement of
possible cut in soviet aid to cuba could affect its economy as well as the
congress proceedings 
""
cb 
""
""
so in the light of this how closely do you think the cubans
will be watching for changes in the party congress that's starting later
today 
""
cb 
""
""
do you expect fidel castro to institute any kind of reforms if
uh to just satisfy these uh expectations 
""
cb 
""
""
but is there a serious challenge at this moment to his
leadership do you think 
""
cb 
""
""
so given the rather severe economic conditions at the moment
how long do you think that fidel castro can hold off public discontent

in a moment spending too much time in front of the television we
find out why malay parents may approve
""
in november last year teleview launched the first supplementary
material and revision tutorials better known as smart and the aim to provide
comprehensive syllabus of revision materials for primary school students
""
the first smart lessons were in english mathematics and science
""
then about six weeks ago the chinese smart lessons were launched
""
yesterday the malay smart program was introduced this has paved the
way for the implementation of smart lessons using teleview's new interactive
learning system or i uh or ils
""
the malay smart will be the first to use the system
""
mrs goh kwan kwan teleview's resident product manager explains to
 word  just how interactive the system can be in teaching
languages
""
""
these systems allowed some the computer to mark the answers
keyed in by the students and it will keep the scores
""
that means immediately after you finish the lesson it will tell you
whether the answer is correct or wrong
""
if it is correct they'll be given one mark for the questions and at
the  word  at the end of the lesson they will give you a
total score and give you the ranking
""
""
are you say that the students can be ranked using this system
""
how are they ranked with whom
""
""
with all those who have locked in the teleview who have tried
the particular lessons all those people who sign in the system know who you
are okay
""
so they will know uh this is your first attempt of this the
questions or this is the second attempt of this of the of the set of
questions
""
so let's say you score ten out of twenty very likely your score
will be in the fifteenth fiftieth position it'll provide some uh motivation
for some of the students maybe not all that want to be always on the top and
uh at the same time it provide convenience that means you can stop anytime at
their own pace
""
so let's say if you uh this lesson have ten questions okay you have
finished until six question and you have to you know have to stop for some
reason and the next time you come back it he knows that you stop at the tenth
lesson and he will give you the eleventh lessons for you to continue to
complete the lessons
""
""
can the system tell him where he's gone wrong
""
""
so far the malay lessons that we have uh uh prepared uh didn't
show that because uh the teacher think that it's not necessary at this point
in time because it's a little bit simple
""
maybe for the future lessons we will uhm have another uh page to
show them uh if you're wrong why you are wrong and what is the corrections uh
""
""
in a classroom situation when the student finds it very
difficult to learn a language in what ways can this interactive system
encourage him to learn a language
""
""
the teachers that uh write this particular lesson uh they are
experts in this area okay and they know they know how to use interactive uh
colourful graphics uh sometime even crossword puzzle to attract them
""
uh we also give bonus to the student who complete the lessons
""
""
now in language learning pronunciation is very important how
does the system help a student pronounce the words properly
""
""
we have another package on teleview that has voice respond
voice output in fact it is the digitized  word  human
voice
""
all the teleview user can download this program and get a voice
card and they can have a voice output and it will be very effective for
learning uh language spoken language

that was tan chuen a four year boy with cerebral pulsy singing
a song he had just learned in school
""
tan chuen is one of the six disabled children who have been
integrated into regular preschools with the help of assisted integration
supporter or  word 
""
the two year uh the two year pilot project is set up by the
singapore counselor of social services
""
it hopes to study the feasibility of integrating physically
disabled children between the ages of two and five into existing pre-schools
""
at present  word  is providing consultative and
therapeutic support  word  preschools
""
it hopes to however to involve more centres and to have a total of
forty disabled students in regular pre-schools by the end of two years
""
karen won ask judy hills the project director whether such a
setting was the most conducive environment for a disabled child 
""
jh 
""
""
but in a regular pre-school teachers are not trained in
working with the special needs children so uhm will this actually hamper the
handicapped child's learning process 
""
jh 
""
""
will the lessons uh have to be adapted with the presence of uh
handicapped child in the school 
""
jh 
""
""
but the teachers will have to pay more attention to this uh
special needs child so will the other children uh actually get less of a
teaching time 
""
jh 
""
""
can you be sure that when the child moves out of this
preschool there will be actually uh kindergarten or even a primary school who
might be willing to take the child on 
""
jh 
""
""
 word  is a teacher in one of the
pre-schools under  word 
""
according to her bringing the two groups of children together has
had a positive effect on the behaviour of the pre-schoolers
""
""
ah the rest of the kids at first they are very uhm they more
they tend to fight more and with wan yi around they tend to help and i see
their other side of them you know the good side all that instead of just the
naughty side
""
they are very nice they play with wan yi very well and i saw that
they are they can talk to her and they play with her very well and they help
her whenever like if she fell down they help to pick her up and if let's say
she cannot colour very well they try to tell wan yi that you're supposed to
colour this way you're supposed to paint this way they help her they become
very helpful and they're very responsible kids now
""
""
he's more vocal he's able to relate stories to me what he has
done and uh he's uh more independent in terms of social behaviour he does
things on his own
""
uhm prior to that when he was uh at the uh uh special school he was
not that responsive responsive i've to do things for him
""
i guess the children there they don't talk very much and uh uhm so
right now when he's uh in this school he plays with the kids the kids they
talk to him and he picks up words from them
""
uhm and i guess the uh the kids benefit too in terms uh you know
when they interact with handicapped child with the children like tan zhen
they are more caring helpful and uh i guess the it it remove the stigma that
people have uh you know uh uh towards handicapped to towards the handicapped
""

and that was mrs shuen tan talking about the benefit of
integration for her physically disabled son

that report was compiled by karen won and on that young note we

and sport tonight starts with results the national bowling
championship and congratulations are in order as grace has taken the title in
the women's section
""
i believe it's the first time you've won the title since taking up
the sport eight years ago
""
""
yes indeed and i'm absolutely thrilled
""
i've often been teased by my fellow bowlers to be only interested
in uh major the tournaments abroad
""
should the troupe be told that i actually faced a lot of home
ground pressure uhm bowling in singapore and i guess the big pool of talent
out there uh adds on more pressure and it also probably stemmed from the fact
that i won my first tournament in nineteen eighty four six months into the
sport
""
""
uhm was there any particular reason why you were doing so much
better in the international titles than in the national games
""
""
i guess uhm psychologically i was better prepared and being a
local tournament uhm i i have not prepared myself well enough over the years
and having four years of experience behind me and international exposure
there's no reason for me not to do well any more locally
""
""
but uh uhm what are your plans now
""
""
well i'm looking forward to the asian fiq which which would be
held in august in in perth and also the major uhm big event south east asian
games next year and singapore will be hosting the sea games next year and
i'll be going for my third masters title so hopefully i will be prepared then 'cos
i have a whole year to do that 
""
""
good luck

thank you
