i think i agree with dr thurow that uhm entrepreneurship isn't is to a certain degree i think irrelevant to discussion of the singapore economy uhm i think what we need really is not so much more talk about entrepreneurship per se i don't think you can actually legislate entrepreneurship you can't uh bring it about with more management programmes uh i think what we need more is to talk about whether in the next lap we will have the kind of creativity the crine of kind of independent thinking that uh the whole population needs to achieve if we are going to achieve the next lap and if that is the case i think entrepreneurs will will come out and uh the mncs will also benefit better so i'm not too sure whether by focussing on whether entrepreneurship is dead or alive we are really focussing on whether the economy is going to do better or not  martin  well i think we need more creative thinking in the next lap whether the creative thinkers are going to be entrepreneurs or working in mncs i think we need more of that in the next lap because in the next lap with more emphasis on brain services if the type of people we're going to have in singapore are are not going to be more creative in their thinking then they're not even going to do well in mncs  martin  well uhm yes i think singapore do need entrepreneurs and uhm if you want to be an entrepreneur you ask yourself or let's say you have an idea and you say well i decide that uh i don't want to work for mncs anymore and that i want to be my own boss uh is that the only reason you want to be an entrepreneur ask yourself uhm if the reason is that uh perhaps you want to uhm have greater freedom okay as some people do or perhaps you want to see the result of your own achievement in terms of seeing the growth of the company that you set up or you would want to uhm have recognition uhm there are number of reasons or perhaps you want to be very rich one of these days okay  martin  well if you become an entrepreneur or try to become an entrepreneur because it's glamourous or because everybody else seems to be doing it i think that's the reason to be to be one uhm perhaps you are not so focussed that's that's quite important to be quite focussed in what you want to do  martin  yah i think you have state entrepreneurship already existing very much in singapore  martin  what if you have to ask yourself whether you are needed in considering whether you you want to be an entrepreneur or not than i think you shouldn't be an entrepreneur to begin with  martin  i think there's room for you in the domestic economy i think singapore is a tracheotomized economy you've got the mnc sector you've got the large uh government link companies and the large public listed companies and then you have a rather small domestic sector i think there's quite a lot of room for entrepreneurship within the domestic sector as to whether you can make that jump from being a small time essentially city oriented economy as dr thurow said whether you can make that leap to becoming even more national regional entrepreneur i think that is a very good question to ask  martin dr thurow martin dr thurow martin  well my view is that uh the government's stand on the role of the entrepreneur or entrepreneurship in singapore is not explicit and if you look for the clues the clues are there in terms of where they gonna be allocating resources in the next lap you know with regard to uh singapore's economy but unless the stay is made more explicit it is very difficult for the other tier in the economy to response ie the institutions uh aided professional bodies the organisation and so forth  martin  dr thurow  if i could add to that i think i think uhm in the problem of entrepreneurship really is like when you mention failure it's like dealing with the problem impotence it's dealing with the problem of failure in that sense and it's also problem of attitude you've got to be more relaxed about your failure you've got to be more relaxed about the overall environment the social culture environment the educational environment the regulatory environment well it's very uh it's very odd to be on one hand very anxious about failure and be very anxious about and very uptight about uh whether we've promoting entrepreneurship enough or not and exatly like dealing with impotence you just got to be more relaxed as a society as a whole relaxed about failure relaxed about many other things that we have including regulations and when that kind of attitudinal environment exist then i think entrepreneurship will arise on its own accord i don't think you can structure it and and mandate and and order it to come about  martin  well i think a lot depends on the individual alright if you are strong enough alright and uh that your inclination and your ambition is that you want to make it and that you take that important step and all you see is that you want to make it and the very thought of failure should be right at the back of your the far end at the back of your mind okay take that plunge here i would agree with uh with rachel totally i i think in the singapore context this is gonna be very difficult to change the environment in terms you know the low tolerance for failures at the end of the day it has got to be with you the entrepreneur martin  now i i would disagree i would disagree with that view totally i think we should not take it as a given that singapore society is going to have this high level of intolerance for failure we should take it as a given and therefore we just praise uhm and try to nurture those entrepreneurs who have made it i think history has shown that a lot of entrepreneurs will finally become successful were not successful initially and i think the the the the crux of the problem really is with the educational system uhm an educational system which on one hand i think we should certainly we should certainly promote meritocracy we should give a lot of attention to achievement orientation but there should not be that collorary stigma attached to failure i think in educational system today we have a lot of young people who at a very age already think they're washed out and they're failures luckily i think educational system is changing today so that those people who are not like to word that much uh to do that well in in grades and academically now probably can find other areas where entrepreneurial flair can be developed they can go to fashion school they can do a lot of other things which previously they could not do but you know i think a lot of it starts from young if you're going to be risk averse when you're young if you are scared to try things because you think if you fail your peers are going to look down upon you uh society is going to look down upon you and that happens to you when you're a teenage what are you going to be like at the age of thirty there will be very few rachel swees around  martin dr thurow martin  well i guess uh you have to do a number of things you know first is you got to sit down and think through it and uh i would advise uh you to think about uh where you are right now and give due consideration to the best case worst case scenario and uh you know if it makes sense to you uh after due delineation have been exercised push on with it  martin  well i'm talking about okay thinking about things like you know how are you going to market it i'm thinking about uh you know who who will who will buy your you know your new uh product  martin  crazy absolutely crazy  martin  well maybe if you were a phd in zoology first okay and genetic engineering and everything else maybe i would say okay i'll take a little look at it but i would say i'll be a little bit doubtful that you could hybridise the chicken and the duck anyway  martin  good good for you  martin  it'll help a little bit  martin  have you done a survey of the market as to whether people would want to consume products like that that's right who likes eating chucks you know what i call due word   martin  alright what are the potential what are the potential market i mean who are your target audience so to speak and uhm what kind of return do you expect of it  martin dr thurow martin  you need resources  martin  i think there are a lot of them  martin  i think there's a difference i think that the example you took of entrepreneurship highlights i think a misconception of what successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurship could be i think that for every one chuck inventor like you there are probably ten thousand other people who have think they have designed a better mouse-trap a better hair-styling lotion or whatever these are the the product entrepreneurs that thinkers and the inventors i think the ratio of success for these people actually is very very small but the other kind of entrepreneur which is likely to be able to succeed i think a bit better is probably the more practical kind perhaps people who work in an mnc an not one person three four people from an mnc come out of mnc and then provide an word already existing type of service or product probably at a cheaper price with an improvement so you don't have that uh that sort the rather more romantic idea of the entrepreneur the thomas addison who invents the lightbulb i think that's really too romanticised what i would call organisation sponsered  martin  uhm i think you should go to your uncle your grandfather every other rich relative you have because seriously if you got a chuck idea uh especially that has got to do animals which is another big problem altogether because you're dealing with a lot of other intangibles and even creating a computer uhm i don't think any venture word is really going to finance you so hope you have a rich uncle and or marry somebody very rich that's the only way you're going to get your money  martin dr thurow martin  but i think there is a very fundamental quantitative difference between this chuck and ben and jerry's ice-cream because the ben and jerry ice-cream is an incremental innovation it's providing a product that's already very well-known with manufacturing processes that are also very well-known it's creating a market niche for itself within an already very large market the us ice-cream market and it's creating a different kind of product so in in that sense if you didn't create a chuck if you found a new way of making hainanese chicken rice that was better quality uh then i may be willing to finance you but my concern is that this chuck is quite different from ben and jerry's ice-cream it's a totally new product that has never been tried out before martin dr thurow  i think there're two ways one would be to look for venture capital funds that are purely venture capital funds  now the one problem with that is that many of these funds have very high uh hundle criteria for return on investments and they also have a short pay back period they've got to be able to cash out of your investment within five years or so so there's a lot of stress on you if you get a pure venture capital fund on the other hand you've also got very large companies insurance companies some of the glcs operating enterprises that have got investment arms and i think these investments arms are in many ways better partners uh on one hand they bring to you not just money nor just professional expertise in terms of pretty professional expertise but they also bring to you a lot of connections that they may have in their own operating ventures uh and in this respect i think one should consider not just getting money from banks nor just pure venture capital funds but finding an actual operating partner to go into business with you
