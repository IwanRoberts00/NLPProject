""
""
i'm shifting to the marketing department
""
""
uh uhm uh what's the date that you're going
""
""
uh lin chin has said that um it's with effect from august
""
""
that's nice
""
""
uh actually what's the proper procedure the
""
""
uh
""
""
supposed we have  word 
""
""
i have to speak to kok wah because probably he already gave the
clearance from what i right
""
""
ya but then uh admin has to
""
""
ya we have to issue a note to say you are henceforth posted to
the new section
""
""
okay
""
""
so since  word  cleared i don't expect too
much problems
""
but uh who's replacing you
""
""
uh i think that uh admin's supposed to have
""
""
recruit is it
""
""
ya
""
""
that's why we have to look at this recruitment in about new
aos
""
we've got quite a few applicants but we don't know whether we want
to you know advertise another round again ya
""
""
do we have vacancies
""
""
ya your vacancy because we've shifted you  word
""
""
""
all right
""
""
and uh some other vacancy you know
""
""
okay
""
""
around so uh when edie comes back lah
""
he's away until twenty twentieth
""
so when he comes back we'd probably get his clearance to do
something
""
probably do another round because at the moment we're doing the
clerks and the lower paid staff
""
""
uhm
""
""
so after that uh after we finish that round of interviews then
we'll come back to the  word  business again
""
there're quite a few applicants but i think maybe my  word
 it it depends on him
""
""
oh
""
""
when when when to do it you see
""
""
okay
""
""
so uh so what have you been doing there
""
have you started work there
""
""
ya uhm i'm helping out with the  word 
dinner which is august the third
""
""
ah third ya
""
""
and then uh i think suzanne is giving me uh it's indicated
that
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uh i should do certain projects lah
""
""
right
""
""
uh like just now i was uh creating a file for uh this this
violinist from england
""
""
ah
""
""
with his academy
""
he's going on tour in september ninety three
""
""
and you're going to get sponsors for that group whatever
""
""
ya
""
""
i see
""
""
quite a number of staff uh in bm bmw in october
""
they're going to bring in either a opera or singing
""
""
oh that's nice
""
in october this year
""
""
yes
""
""
uh bmw is sponsoring is it
""
""
ya
""
""
joined with nac
""
""
ya
""
""
ah that's great
""
""
we are presenting
""
""
uhm
""
""
so
""
""
what what's the opera
""
""
i don't really know if it's an opera actually but
""
""
or is a musical
""
""
ya something like that
""
""
it's on the music side is it
""
""
ya
""
""
ya that's fine
""
""
and then
""
""
so is it kallang
""
""
 word  i think that's the biggest venue lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
ya
""
""
well i'm sure we're all looking forward to going
""
""
ya
""
""
so how
""
after festival of arts not dead yet
""
""
no lah immigration almost killed me okay
""
""
ya but i think that's sorted out quite well and the indian
group did come
""
""
ya
""
""
that one that uh i helped you to clear
""
""
ya but uh i think in the i think the post-mortem helps in the
sense that uh it prepares the next person
""
""
next person
""
""
who is
""
""
ya
""
""
going to take over you see
""
""
but we're probably trying to catch the same person 'cos then
the person
""
""
no
""
""
will know the job better
""
""
oh no
""
""
well if you don't want uh you probably have to do logistics of
other sorts anyway or worse
""
wait till they present you with ticketing where you have to be like
connie and get scolding from the public
""
""
oh no
""
""
oh that's worse you know
""
""
i'm not looking forward to it man
""
""
ya but that's uh that's one in two years right
""
but uh
""
""
i think i had sleepless nights man about this
""
""
ya i know  word  sleepless nights about
something or other
""
so that's why they are going to give you all a thank you lunch or
dinner
""
""
not me
""
""
all of us
""
all of us
""
all of us
""
""
really
""
""
every single one
""
either chairman or minister will give something i mean a thank you
 word 
""
""
oh this year
""
""
and uh council did say i think it's recorded in my notes
""
oh hi we're like having a taped conversation
""
she's doing some survey work
""
could you come in oh okay fine
""
right
""
okay
""
fine okay right
""
uh this one has to do with some endowment policy
""
we've been doing some research work there
""
""
oh ya
""
""
uhm so how to invest our money  word 
""
""
ya i think uh quite good lah now that after a year it's been
a year
""
""
uhm
""
""
and i'm paying income tax
""
""
oh
""
""
i just brought in my income tax form today
""
""
and uh have you all got any new sponsors in mind
""
don't name them in the tape though
""
""
oh ya uh
""
""
ya
""
""
is this going to be confidential
""
i hope so
""
""
uhm but we haven't discussed any  word 
""
""
my career moves
""
""
no but i mean it's like it's already known right
""
because uh kok wah
""
""
ya
""
""
has agreed to it and uh you know shouldn't worry about it
""
""
ya
""
""
it's just that i think it's a very exciting area to go into
but
""
""
i think so
""
""
you should also maybe get suzanne's help or yourself because
we don't have the time really
""
if there are any marketing courses uh or fund-raising
""
fund-raising usually they don't have fund-raising
""
we usually have to internally organize
""
but uh i suppose suzanne can uh give you some advice
""
""
ya
""
""
'cos some of the courses that i'm  word 
""
i'm seeing someone on the sixteenth
""
this fellow is from don't-know-what university
""
uh uh this was before i think what lester or what lest what don't
know which university in uk
""
now they they've converted into a university
""
no that was a polytechnic before
""
now it's converted to a university
""
let me see where he's from grayham chapman hai
""
i forgot which university  word  gave me the
card
""
he he's coming here and i was seeing whether we can link up
because there're like only two universities that do arts admin courses you
know
""
""
uhm
""
""
this one and of course city university london
""
""
ya
""
""
but i i think the states
""
practically every other university has arts admin course
""
""
really
""
""
ya they've got a whole manual
""
""
oh i'm i'm so glad that
""
""
uhm
""
""
you are  word 
""
""
no i've had the  word  ya but the thing is
that we are debating as to whether you really need to uh
""
if you are already a graduate it's not necessary to do a like
three-year arts admin course because the arts admin course covers a lot of
areas which you already know
""
""
that's true
""
""
uh marketing if you're econs graduate statistics and all that
""
you probably want to do like diploma kind you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
or selected credit subjects
""
""
uhm
""
""
uhm
""
""
but what if we uh are interested in say uh a marketing course
uh in in institute of singapore
""
""
if ya uh you see we are quite liberal uh who is this person
""
uh yong kian is already enrolled for a pr course you know and we
paid for it
""
if you do come across a marketing course which i think sim and all
that has
""
""
yes yes ya
""
""
get a brochure
""
let us know apply to us we definitely consider because we also get
sdf funding 'cos that mean we don't need to pay in total
""
""
i see
""
oh this is  word 
""
""
so even for yong kian's one we're getting some sdf funding
okay
""
""
okay but i hear her she's it's a very uh short-term
""
""
no
""
""
course right
""
it's like uh only about about few months
""
""
but she sits for
""
ya ya a few months and then she gets a cert
""
""
uhm
""
""
but you see i think uh yours could be a longer one
""
""
ya
""
""
it could be a diploma
""
""
ya
""
""
so we i do not know the detailed arrangements but if say you
it's relevant to your area of work
""
""
uhm
""
""
we will support if it's not too expensive and you can get sdf
funding  word 
""
we got to look at that aspect
""
and then also uh i don't know whether they'll bond people
""
i mean if we pay and
""
""
oh
""
""
whether we'll bond them but
""
""
oh i see
""
""
i mean if if it's only two three thousand i don't think we'll
bond them
""
""
okay
""
""
uh
""
but then like yong kian was saying that she wanted us to pay her
membership fee after she's completed the course
""
but i think that's not fair lah because after you complete a
course it's already your own personal one whether you want to continue
""
""
membership fee
""
""
ya i think what this institute of what public public relation
""
""
oh that that's a different
""
""
ya ya
""
it's so ya
""
""
thing  word  altogether uh
""
""
so you should look at those sim courses because i think you
can even take exams that are you know marked by accredited uh institutions
abroad
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
so you do come out with another skill
""
a danger of training you people so well you become so marketable
you say goodbye to us at the end of it
""
""
oh ya
""
but then no risk no gain
""
""
uhm well we expect well you you have some commitment uh
""
""
uh
""
""
but you'll probably say you want some career path mapped out
for you too
""
""
ya
""
""
uh uh
""
so you i mean we will well in a way if we were to to train you and
all it's already part of career development and all that
""
and it also would depend on your performance and what they they
""
""
uhm
""
""
consider i mean we have to look at your cep lah
""
cep is always moving
""
you know what is cep or not
""
current estimated potential
""
""
rising hopefully
""
""
uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
so like some people when they come in it's like in
government's eyes all scholars have very high cep future perm secs
""
""
oh
""
""
that kind of thing
""
""
but uh i think that any investment will will entail some form
of risk lah
""
""
ya
""
""
so uh you're investing in your manpower
""
""
uhm well
""
""
there's risk involved
""
""
we we have to like say after you finish your course you say
goodbye
""
""
uhm that will quite sad
""
""
ya but then marketing people are so in demand and the market
outside pays so well
""
""
uhm
""
""
you know it's a problem keeping people
""
so maybe i don't know
""
hold on a minute
""
""
wow so loud
""
""
that's myself going for a course
""
i've always nominated people for courses
""
it's a local course i need to go there
""
""
 word  administration
""
""
uh for a job evaluation
""
""
oh
""
""
uhm two full days and then that's in july end of july and
then uh two full days in august
""
""
selecting the right people for the right job
""
""
no not really
""
job evaluation is like you know uh you evaluate the worth of the
job you know
""
that that's the
""
then from there then they'll determine the market value of the job
""
""
ah
""
""
uhm
""
""
we can see the application  word 
""
""
so that after you've done that then you can come up with a
new salary structure
""
""
uhm
""
""
uhm
""
well i mean this has been very fruitful
""
i mean discussing your career prospects and what we are doing uh
""
""
ya
""
""
is the fifteen minutes up yet
""
or do we have another
""
another okay
""
so i don't know what else you want to talk about
""
about the tailors
""
""
 word  no no tell tell me about your
golfing
""
where do you golf and
""
""
uh sembawang
""
""
 word  range
""
""
i went last evening also
""
no i graduated from the range and on the course already
""
""
oh
""
""
and uh i think it's good lah because it's uphill and downhill
so it does keep you physically quite fit
""
i was telling barbara that now i'm so disciplined that i wake up
so early and you know
""
""
wow
""
""
i i don't feel so tired uhm
""
i'm really on the go so uhm
""
""
uhm the new catherine uh 
""
""
ya ha ha ha ha no i don't know how long that is
""
i mean it's not like those early days and we all were like so
stressed and you know
""
""
oh
""
""
ya i i think those days when i looked back at it it's like i
i i looked at it like from you know
""
it's as though you know it's a nightmare
""
i mean you know
""
there must i mean
""
""
ya it's like that things have been much more  word
""
""
""
ya and then like more space for people you know
""
people are getting used to their work so they don't come ka chow
you everyday
""
""
well this room helps
""
""
ya it does
""
""
doesn't it
""
ya
""
""
ya
""
well but then also i think outside is much better because we
always want programmer which is like the noisest people
""
""
well that's not true
""
""
 word 
""
""
not true
""
""
is it very noisy outside still
""
""
uh certain days
""
""
uhm
""
""
you're just you're just amazed
""
you just like
""
""
it's very difficult to
""
""
look up and
""
""
ya
""
""
like where does the noise come from
""
""
it's quite difficult to concentrate isn't it
""
especially when you're trying to you know
""
""
work out something especially  word 
""
""
uhm
