""
""
good evening
""
""
the soviet foreign minister resigns
""
in home news the select committee of the elected president bill
proposes amendments in its report
""
in parliament the government has decided to promote the use of
unleaded petrol and to give the building authority greater powers to deal
with squatters and the acting minister for information and the arts
brigadier-general george yeo calls for confidence and optimism in our effort
to promote asian culture
""
""
parliament began today with the swearing-in of the two newly
appointed nominated members mr leong chee wah and the associate professor
morris choo
""
they'll serve as nmps for a period of two years
""
parliament today also heard details of plans to introduce unleaded
petrol for use by cars
""
from july all imported petrol-driven vehicles will have to be able
to use unleaded petrol and from january nineteen ninety three all new
petrol-driven vehicles will have to be fitted with catalytic converters
""
in a ministerial statement the environment minister dr ahmad mattar
also reveals that from the first of february there'll be a price difference
in favour of unleaded petrol
""
""
the tax on unleaded petrol which is more expensive to produce
will be reduced from fifty percent to forty eight percent from february
""
while for leaded petrol an additional tax will be levied to make it
about ten cents per litre more expensive than unleaded petrol
""
this means that if the current pump price for leaded petrol is one
dollar nineteen cents the new price in february will be one thirty four for
leaded petrol and one twenty four for unleaded petrol
""
it was also announced that from july nineteen ninety one all
petrol-driven vehicles imported for use in singapore will have to be able to
use unleaded petrol
""
dr mattar said in the meantime the ministry will work with oil
companies and motor traders to advise motorists on whether their cars can
switch to the use of unleaded petrol and all companies have been very
supportive of this switch and said it was a logical extension of the
ministry's long-term goal of a more environmentally conscious society
""
there are at present about three hundred and thirty two thousand
petrol-driven registered cars on our roads and about ninety percent or three
hundred thousand cars are able to switch to unleaded petrol
""
the remaining thirty two thousand cars which are mainly cars older
than seven years cannot use unleaded petrol and most of the motor-cycles on
our roads can also use unleaded petrol
""
dr mattar explained that in singapore the main source of lead in
the air is from vehicle emission
""
although the lead content in our air is well within safe levels our
car population is growing and if the lead content in petrol is maintained at
current level the growth in car population will result in rising lead levels
in the air which can have damaging effects on health
""
the ministry has assured the public that it will not be stopping
the sale and use of leaded petrol since about ten percent of the cars in
singapore will still need to use leaded petrol
""
and from january nineteen ninety three there'll be stricter
emission standard for all new petrol-driven vehicles
""
they will need to have catalytic converters to convert harmful
hydrocarbons and other gases to safe ones like carbon dioxide nitrogen and
water
""
but dr mattar said because catalytic converters will be damaged by
lead present in leaded petrol they cannot be introduced until after unleaded
petrol becomes widely available and is used in singapore
""
""
among the bills passed by the house today with the building
control amendment bill it gives the building authority more powers to deal
with unauthorized structures especially those built by squatters on private
land
""
in moving the bill's second reading the national development
minister mr s dhanbalan said by the end of this year squatters will be
cleared from some three hundred and fifty lots of private land all over
singapore and by nineteen ninety two some four thousand seven hundred
squatters on state land and more than one thousand five hundred on land
managed by the malayan railway administration will also have to go
""
""
the government had in nineteen eighty set a target of ten
years to make singapore squatter-free much has been achieved
""
up to october this year the government has cleared more than one
hundred and fifty thousand squatter cases on state land
""
however mr dhanabalan said the heaviest concentration of squatters
is found on land along the railway track malayan railway authorities have
tried to clear these squatters since nineteen eighty six but they've not been
very successful
""
mr dhanabalan said many of these structures are make-shift huts
erected without permission and are dangerously sited on both sides of the
railway track
""
they are safety hazards potential fire risks and blights on our
environment
""
for those who have to be relocated today will be the cut-off date
to qualify for resettlement benefits
""
those who move into the squatter areas after today will not qualify
for the benefits
""
it's costing the singapore government thirty seven point five
million dollars in the  word  instance to pay for
compensation and clearance
""
the malays in government has agreed the cost will be recovered when
the authorities returned the land to singapore
""
the first phase of the clearing from kampong silat to upper bukit
timah road will start in january while the second phase stretching right up
to woodlands is expected to start at the end of next year
""
the government has given the assurance that this will be done with
as little dislocation as possible
""
the amended bill also sets out new procedures for enforcement
actions
""
the building authority will be able to serve the demolition order
and either the owner or occupier of the building
""
previously it can only serve the owner
""
it can also order the closure of an unauthorized building
""
this means the occupiers will have to vacate the place for
demolition to proceed
""
those who fail to comply can be taken to court and made to pay the
full cost incurred for removing the structures
""
""
mr dhanabalan also moved for a second reading of the
architects bill and the professional engineers bill
""
he allow registered architects and professional engineers to team
up with allied professionals to form multi-discipline partnerships and
limited liability companies
""
the bills have been referred to a select committee
""
during question time the senior minister of state for foreign
affairs brigadier-general george yeo told the house the first deployment of
us naval and airforce personnel in singapore begins in march next year
""
some ninety five of them can be expected on a year-round basis and
a further seventy five on as temporary basis
""
parliaments adjourn to the third of january
""
more details of the day's proceedings will be telecast in this
channel at ten pm
""
""
singapore should promote asian cultures and values with
confidence and optimism says the acting minister for information and the arts
""
brigadier-general george yeo says cultural influence follows
economic strength and as the economies of eats and south-east asia develop so
too will their cultural influence on the rest of the world
""
""
in all of history there is a strong link between economic
performance and culture and so we see japanese management culture following
japanese capital into america and into europe and it is japanese cul
management culture which will in the end revive many industries in particular
the automobile industry in america and in europe and not far behind japan are
the nies and the countries of asean and behind them there is china and there
is vietnam
""
""
general yeo was speaking at a seminar on the social role of
singapore newspapers in promoting asian cultures and values he said
singapore's national debate on cultures and values must be set against the
larger historical backdrop of the changing dialogue between east and west and
we must avoid self-doubt and pessimism in promoting asian cultures
""
""
if we proceed from an inferiority complex then the likelihood
is that we will become extreme and we will over-compensate and we will not
be rigorous
""
then we also become petty and narrow-minded and there's no reason
at all for such pessimism
""
there's no need for chauvinism of any kind east or west and east
and west have now to learn from each other
""
of course  word  needn't reminded us that east
and west have always learnt from each other and from a historical perspective
what we are really seeking is a new synthesis of east and west which raises
human civilization to a higher level
""
so in the end we must not forget the wise words of confucius 'si
hai zhi nei jie xiong ti' that within the four seas all men are brothers
""
""
coming up in a while
""
""
the economic development board says the chemical sector grew
by fifteen percent last year and its likely to maintain this healthy grow
rate in nineteen ninety
""
investments are expected from european american and japanese
pharmaceutical and petrochemical firms
""
as for the light industries such as food and beverages furniture
textiles and apparel the edb expects the sector to improve marginally
following three years of good growth
""
printing and publishing however are likely to grow by ten percent
""
spokesmen said the light industries depend heavily on the us market
and with the current slowdown of the american economy those dealing in
consumer products will find it tough going
""
the sector's performance may also be affected by the gulf crisis
and the weather now
""
""
and the
""
""
occasional showers can be expected tomorrow around mid-day and
in the afternoon
""
the temperature should keep between twenty four and thirty one
degrees
