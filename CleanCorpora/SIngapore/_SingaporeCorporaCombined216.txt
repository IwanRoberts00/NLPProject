good afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome to the lexmark product announcement perhaps uh from major announcement of the year let me first of all extent a warm welcome to all our customers and also i understand our friendly competitors who are with us today i would like to congratulate most of you who have come here through the heavy rain i understand that is going on outside or uh has it stop since i've been in here i know most of you would have a busy schedule and i'm delighted to have the opportunity to present to you the latest lexmark family of printers we are very excited and optimistic about this new product in the next thirty odd minutes i hope to cover all these new benefits the that our new range of printers are going to provide you and i hope you'll be so persuaded that when you think of lexmark when you think of laser printers it is either the ibm laser printers or the lexmark laser printers so announcing today may fourth the new ibm laser printer series forty thirtynine we are announcing four new models today namely the forty thirty-nine ten r the forty thirty-nine twelve r the forty thirty-nine twelve l the forty thirty-nine sixteen l as you can see on the board the printers speed range from ten pages per minute sixteen pages per minute in other words our printers today are targeted not so much to low-end but at the medium to the lan printers range our existing range of laser printers the forty twenty-nine continue to be current line products from the chart you can see that forty twenty-nine which is a ten-page per minute machine will be positioned slightly below the forty thirty-nine ten r at the lowest end we continue to offer a very low end printer the forty nineteen e what i'm going to cover next in the next two charts is really uh to present to you some of the things that uh we've discovered from talking to customers from speaking to our dealers things that we believe you as our customers find important in our laser printers i'm sure that you would recognise that these are the things that you look for when you're buying a laser printer and i guess uh each of these will be more important than the rest to uh each and the individual one of you print quality ease of operation compatibility to all the applications that you're running your ability to connect the laser printer that you buy to your local area network you want your printer to support all the protocols that you're running in your local area network and of course you want your printer to be of a reasonable speed if not fast paper handling i guess uh most of you would be aware i mean uh we use transparency we use uh all sorts of paper uh text rough texture alright we have thick paper and all sorts alright as we speak to the customers we also told that uh hey we buy a laser printer it cost a few thousand dollars how do you protect my investment customers today are getting more sophisticated they are printing more and more sophisticated thing from the laser printers they want to know if they can store fonts or forms in the laser printers so that the they can have a faster print out without having to down load the uh the forms or logos from the computer being real image conscious i think a lot of companies support today the environment friendly movement and when you buy a laser printer i i would imagine that you would choose a product that is environment friendly last but certainly not least especially in a competitive market like singapore i think the price performance is certainly a key buying criteria for most of you having gone through some of these uh features that i would imagine most of you would look for i think we put together a printer that is what we call uhm packed with features that are customer driven let us look at what some of these benefits that you can enjoy from this uh ibm lasers range uh sorry lexmark ibm printers in my discussions with uh a lot of the customers one of the things that was single out most is compatibility when uh one buys a laser printer a customer hey when i bring the printer back to my company i just want to uh plug the printer on i don't to change the drivers i don't want to change whatever configurations that i've already put into my software in other words they want to plug the printer and play so to speak alright so the the the ibm forty thrity-nine laser printers today are designed as we what we term as plug and play how do we do this the forty thirty-nine printers come standard with the pcl five and the postscript uh data screen as standard in other words most of you whose applications are running on pcl five or postscript will find that you would have no problem with data screen support if you are a macintosh well we have the apple-top option that you could easily plug on and then use this highly competitive machines in a macintosh environment certainly second on the list must surely be ease of use when you buy a laser printer and you put it in your company different people use it and different people with uh different skill levels so you must make sure that the laser printer is easy to use so when we ship the printer today we ship it to what we call a quick start set up utility what is this this is a series of diskettes that we put into the uh box that when you open it you can uh run this into pc and you realise that these diskettes contain the popular drivers for the drivers for you popular applications it provides you with uh help screens that help you in store your printers in whatever configuration you want and basically the bottom line is to make installation so easy that you generally do not have to read the manual or call your dealer up to help you with it the forty thirty-nine following the tradition of the forty twenty-nine where we have had a very intuitive operator panel to make it easy for the end-users the forty thirty-nine comes with a four-line display alright uh i can assure you that this operator panel is very easy to use very intuitive hard for me to stand here and convince you i guess but uh what i would encourage you to do is when this session is over the machines are placed behind i would encourage each each of you to look at the machines and try out the panel for yourself and i'm sure you would agree with me that the panel is very easy to use having said that you need to plug and play it means that the printer must be smart enough to know what data stream is coming to it so we've packed into the forty thirty-nine what we call the smart switch the smart switch feature will sniff out for you the data stream of the file that you're that sending to the printer in other words if you were if your printer is on pcl 5 font and a postscript file is coming on the printer will know it's a postscript file and automatically switch to postscript alright so in other words uh no operating complication and no garbage print we have have what we call the automatic port sensing alright the printer comes with standard a serial port a parallel port and ability for you to hook up a internal network adaptor card so in other words for you to print from each of these ports your printer is smart enough to detect where the signals are coming into which port and uh having detected which is your active port you must know how to switch so automatic port setting comes standard and that makes it very easy to use just like the forty thirty twenty-nines the new laser printers have got the print cartridge in stored when it is shipped so that makes it easy for you again when you open the box the print cartridge is already in the printer and uh again finally but not the least you have a laser printer that is small in size light in weight especially if you compare the lan model the forty thirty-nine sixteen l when you compare it to some of the uh local area network printer out in the market you would realise that we've got a printer that is of a very small foot print but yet do the job of being a lan printer now print quality why would one want to buy a laser printer i guess uh first and foremost we want to have excellent print quality because it affects our image after all when we launch the dates fourteen twentynine laser printer we say it's your image make the most of it so the laser printers ability to do a six hundred dot per inch resolution we have the what we call the print quality enhancement technology this is a curve smoothing technology that is now available in the six hundred dots per inch environment in other words you get sharper print than ever the laser printers today come with a new technology that lexmark has incorporated called the picturegrade this is a image enhancement technology now with this technology it allows the uh lexmark laser printers to print up to to print images right with up to one hundred shades of grey the number of shades of grey that you can print will directly affect the print quality of the graphics that you print so if you look at some of the printouts that we have that has grey scaling i'm sure you agree with me that with this latest picturegrade enhancement technology we've got printouts that are far superior to what we have seen the next thing that we've done to increase the uhm print quality is really the superior toner technology what this does is to avoid the ghosting image problem i understand that ? ? that some of the printers competition printers out there today do have this problem in other words uh when you print a black uh when you print a page that has a lot of black on it and then you go on to the next page and you uh hold up the text page against the light you do see some of the ghosting effect left from the previous page using the superior toner technology lexmark is able to avoid this problem and i think uh if you compare printouts that has got a lot of patches of black with the uh lexmark printers this is superior machine to a lot of those that are out in the market to allow to increase the quality of your printout we give you fifty-two scalable fonts and we also give you the ability to adjust the stroke weight of this font having print quality is important but so is having a high having a machine that prints at a speed that you want we have uh move on from the motorola ? ? uh processes that we use in the forty twenty-nine to the risc processes risc processes as you would know is faster in calculate in rected?? calculations and that gives you a much faster printout especially when you have complicated uh graphic as mention earlier the printers the printers start from ten pages per minute goes all the way up to sixteen pages per minute in order to uh increase print speed we have what we call the advance memory management system
