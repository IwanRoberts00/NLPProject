26 march 1992 how progress helps you to downsize 
""
uh so come to uh this session
""
uh i'm joseph liew
""
i'm from base management system
""
we are the distributor for progress in singapore
""
uh graph sizing computing application from mainframe and
microcomputers to pc lan is one of the hottest trend in uh corporate
computing today
""
okay mis challenged by uh increasing cost pressure uh accelerating
business changes and competition
""
uh we are also faced with technological change and complexity uh also
shifting management structure
""
all these business uh pressures have actually forced mis to rely on
either out outside what you call outsourcing or downsizing
""
and according to the recent survey sixty to seventy percent of
fortune thousand companies are in the actively in downsizing project or plan
to get started within the next twelve months
""
many companies are searching for low cost computing options and a
desire to improve the flexibility of computing application
""
instead of running all uhm corporate application on mainframe or
micro mis director now find that uhm there are many application that can run
perfectly well on small computer connected in a network environment
""
a well-constructed uh network can house plenty of computing power
today
""
uh the components of all these uh network configuration uh people are
using things like personal computers workstation pass server database server
""
and it can be if you can uh appropriate size and then uh plug in or
plug up uhm the environment you can make your application uh run very uh
successfully according to the needs uhm it takes
""
okay you can plug in or out from the environment
""
moving uh application to smaller computer if you have done it
correctly you can achieve the following:
""
one substantially uh lower the operation cost while improving
flexibility
""
second enjoy the same computing power and benefit of a mainframe or
microcomputer at only a fraction of cost
""
you can also realize greater flexibility when it comes to development
support and ongoing maintenance
""
you have at your disposal more flexible tool for development and
support and also more scaleable platform for ongoing maintenance
""
move away you can also move away from uh this what call 
word  computing boxes towards more open or at least uh reusable
hardware
""
in some cases the server of today uh can be downsized to the
workstation end-user workstation of tomorrow
""
another key to im uh improving flexibility of system is the movement
away from the third generation development languages like cobol or c
""
okay so uh you are i i believe uh all of you come to this show uh you
have more or less decided to adopt downsizing as a company strategy to
improve your practical advantages and better leverage your information
investment
""
now the challenge is uh you is on you as to how you should take
application that were mainframe or microcomputer and uh orientated uh and
bring it down to a uh low-end uh pc lan environment
""
downsizing doesn't uh equate to a reducing software development time
and cost uh at least not automatically
""
uh creating software for a downsized system can entail significantly
higher cost than for a mainframe environment especially if it's done with a
third generation language traditionally used to develop large mainframe
software like cobol or c
""
because such languages assume that an application will run on a
single computer
""
they do not directly support distribution or processing and data over
her heterogeneous network of geographically dispersed computers
""
the principal requirement for most application running in a downsized
environment
""
consequently using a third generation language to downsize
application entail designing and coding support for network computing into
the application software itself which is a also a major ah undertaking
""
so is manager under pressure to downsize need a more powerful breed
of uh application development tool
""
you need an effective downsizing environment that meets the combined
requirements of integrity and reliability security and straightforward setup
and maintenance
""
you need support from two for planning and design
""
that's why uhm we are trying to uh introduce you progress how
progress can actually help you to solve the increasing business pressure in
terms of lower the cost adapting to change business change and uh supporting
machine uh of management structures
""
okay let me bring you uh to progress uh product itself
""
progress actually offer the complete uh application development
system
""
progress has got its own fourth   4  gl with sql we also have a fast
track what you call is a application user can actually paint screen uhm
create menu and adhoc reports using this uh fast track
""
progress also had its own data dictionary and its own relational
database
""
this uh progress fourth   4  gl actually is a very elegant procedural
and now you can create procedural and non-procedural statements uh if you are
uh using the default or the uh progress command uh you can actually uh cut
short a lot of development time uh
""
inside this uh there is a enter where it will do the normal syntax
checking for you uh while you are phototyping your application
""
you also have a on-line help facility within the enter
""
you can do what are like key-stroke level programming control
""
uh progress also support old uh sql and you are writing any uh things
to communicate with your hardware uh  word  peripheral if
you require to use c to do the communication or whatever
""
progress do support uh c interface for this special purpose
""
progress actually give you a high level support for many tasks common
to transaction processing and information access such as database
manipulation and screen and report processing enables creation of downsized
application in a fraction of a time required inverted g
""
if you are a this uh fast track is actually a menu-driven application
user which is very ideal for uh rapid phototyping you can paste screens
design menu and reports
""
it can also perform uh ad-hoc database query and the fast track
itself is actually written uh on progress
""
so uh whatever things you you are making use to do it will generate
the reusable fourth   4  gl code for you
""
so you can actually make use of this fourth   4  gl code and uh bring
it in and cut and paste into your application procedure and you can save this
uh course in the library and as and when you can uh bring this out to uh cut
and paste or do some modification to suit your application requirement
""
progress also support development of uh application distributed
across heterogeneous computer networks
""
uh it automatically handle uh the distributed processing such as uh
communication re re remote processes and accessing the ah store in uh other
computer and progress actually support hundreds of uh hard hardware
""
uh we also support the operating system like dos os/2 uh in respaced
kind of system running unix or os/2
""
you have also uhm workstation running unix or bms
""
all those uh application that is developed using progress fourth   4)
gl you can actually port it over to any of these supported platform without
having to change any the user interface and so on
""
uh actually are identical across all the platforms
""
in this occasion uh you can easily uh plug on or unplug the uh system
from this network as and when uh you know information needs to  word
""
""
progress has got its own interactive data dictionary which allow you
to uh control things like file and field validation
""
this is very good for you to uh make use to uh checking input
validation rules
""
it also support uh password only
""
authorized uh user can then access to these uh field level and it
also provide database uh trigger to ensure specific processing on key events
""
other than that uh in the dictionary itself you also can store the
gateway information to alternate database
""
for instance you may have uh other databases uh not uh third party
one not support uh it will be sup it's uh supported by program like oracle
rdd ims ci etceteras
""
okay uh you also can store the what you call network protocol
information within the data dictionary itself
""
the data dictionary will then dynamically connect or disconnect uhm
to all databases required by your application
""
if you do not  word  to uh have any uh transaction
over the other databases uh progress will disconnect it for you so that you
will enhance the power and other things like uh it will host the 
word  import and also the export facility within this uh data
dictionary
""
progress has a uh its own relational database
""
this actually eliminates the need to acquire or develop sep separate
rddms interface routine and assure that application written in progress
fourth   4  gl are able to use all of the features of the rddm ms
""
you can uh access from the environment menu alone with the source
code editor compiler debugger and other tools
""
this will speed compiler development our database and the program
that will use those databases
""
uh second it can it also provide capability to safeguard uh against
system as well as human failure
""
one uh to prevent corruption of the database as a result of system
failure data roll back is provided automatic uh purging from the database of
all transaction left incomplete by a system failure
""
the next function is to uh guard against non-recoverable disk failure
""
you have things like roll forward can be uh you can enable locking or
transaction to a second disk in the event of main disk uh fail the system can
recreate the database by merging the transaction uh with the last archive uh
copy of the database
""
in this relational database we also support things like uh flexible
uh record locking control
""
we have uh we support multi  word  server for high
performances you can connect say uh up to two hundred and forty databases and
uh you have you can have transaction like two thousand four hundred and
seventy eight records update simultaneously within the database
""
you can have uh things like on-line data backup
""
uh progress also support two face  word  this is
for distributed database  word  and there are tool
provided to you for performance monitoring and  word 
""
progress also uh support client server uh architecture
""
progress soft fourth   4  gl signif signifying the uh simplify the
development of dispersed application possible by implementing a client server
distributed computer model utilizing built-in protocol for co-ordination
""
a client server model actually divide an application into two types
of uh co-operating tasks: one those specific to the application and those
common to a group of application
""
a server perform the common task at the request of a client task and
a client server model actually has uh several advantages:
""
one it allow client to be developed uh independently of servers and
reduce development time by eliminating
""
one needs to write codes for those tasks handled by the server second
client server model also support distributed processing by dividing an
application into segments that can run on different processor or computers as
long as communication can be established between them
""
a server for a database used by multiple application can run on a
time-shared central computer with a client running on workstation connected
to time-shared system via a local area network
""
such as uh such a configuration preserve the central control
advantages of mainframe environment while offering uh loading application
specific processing onto low-cost workstations
""
these are all the uh operating systems supported by progress
""
uh you can address dms ms-dos unix xenix altrix ais aus 
word 
""
right now progress also uh support uh as four hundred the os four
hundred uh okay
""
the application regardless where you develop the source from whether
is it uh dos single-user or  word  system the source code
where you are plotting to the next operating system or platform you do not
have to rewrite any single code
""
progress also provide uh connectivity across all the standard uh
network protocol such as netbio pcpip  word  net spx ibx
or os5 
""
you can actually uh distribute your database across uh all other
platforms when you are running the application progress the will 
word  will uh automatically point to you where the data is and you
go and retrieve and access the data on the database regardless where it is
stored progress databases uh can be can also be independent i mean those
fourth   4  gl uh application developed using progress can access to ei
either progress or to other databases like oracle rdd or ims progress also uh
give you uh robust gateway uh besides the progress oracle ims rdd uh right
now we can also support the ci  word  and uh 
word  will be uh releasing very soon
