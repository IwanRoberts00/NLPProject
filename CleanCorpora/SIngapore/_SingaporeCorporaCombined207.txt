and in fact when i started teaching since 84 i realise one thing that a lot of men and women has great substance great potential right before a lot of them didn't realise that they could do far greater things than what they have been doing and there's another group of people that they try hard to but they can't reach it there because they seems to be beating around the bushes and there's another group of people that who wake up in the morning and blame god for what they are and those that are people who never get going and also there's also another group of people that have great substance but never feel convince anybody that they have they never give themselves a chance for us to discover them because of their exterior that they put across so we're going to show you today that how human being read you and between you and god you know what god expect out of you but you have to also understand that you're already in this earth when you deal with people and you must know what people want from you before you can talk about your god before you can talk about anything that you want to say alright so beauty is so important that it is no more really you do what you like because you're not really in a world of your own by yourself you have to do what you like best and what others like you to do as well because if you do what you like and others can't stand it you're going to pay a price for being wrong a tremendous heavy prices that you can never calculate opportunities in life lost a great opportunities that can never be calculated alright so you have to come to understanding about what others want and by the time you're able to make others feel comfortable to be with you even then your likings will change because others like you in a certain thing majority of our what we like what we prefer is influence by what others like us to project isn't it true why you like a certain outfit why do you like a certain look because your friend like you to be like that isn't it true you like a certain dress because everytime you wear it people say that you look great you wear a certain tie everytime you wear it people say your tie looks nice remember your tie look nice not you okay there's a lot difference between hey you look great today rather than your dress is beautiful alright and and i started learning from human being every talk and every class and every people i have meet i learn one thing that there's a lot of difference between people who are poorer and a lower living standard and people go higher and as you go higher doesn't mean that you're happier as you go rich it doesn't mean that you're happier and a happiest person i've ever seen are people who are able to bring themselves down to the same group of people they're mixing with the happiest people are people who are able to be accepted by human beings isn't it true so how do you come to a compromise and how do you project it through with all first and foremost through your exterior image you get exposure you improve and you upgrade i'm not saying by if uh dressing nicely you'll be rich do you understand i'm just saying that if you can be for for a club and you can be the best for the club if you achieve you promoted to be secretary and you know i'm secretary be a best looking secretary or it give you incentive to perform better your boss can see that you're well-guarded it give you more incentive to upgrade that's how people move on in life alright now the dressing plays a very important role the colour the style the texture the prints and fabric any one part of it wrong enough to make you look awful and before i can teach you how to dress in word  all of us here have to one thing when we go back home just take a mirror and take a good look at ourself and tell ourself that we're good-looking okay i tell you why i tell you why you have to do that because too many of us want to be like someone else the small eyes wants to make bigger the flat nose want to have it higher the square face want to have it rounder and the round face want to have it longer i always tell people that small eyes can be nice don't you agree right so if you if you don't learn to like yourself it is very difficult for others to learn to like you isn't it true if you can't even stand your face how can people like your face right irregardless of your shortness your height the darkness the fairness even to the extent of being bald you can be great in your own way and first by using colours of your coordination and after that we make you look rarefied using different styles and fabrics that you use you just have to remember that it's doesn't even cost a lot if you know how and cost a lot if you don't know how and bring out the best of you i am going to take you to the first part of the talk on how the colours can match you and then the style then we go for a break and after that after the break we're going to teach you how to carry yourself through you having outfit but don't know how to sit and walk and and move properly people can't respect your outfit as well alright now with colours probably that you can wear many women alike dressing it's not just for women you have to understand that it's a lot more important for men as well because men don't use makeup so when they are wrong they are completely wrong and and women can get away and run away with some parts of it wrong and some parts of it right that's why it's so important for men now the colours that you can wear you have to remember that got nothing with how young or how old you are so what i tell you today you will not feel strong much alright it's not true when your mother says that i am fifty-five now and seventy now i shouldn't be wearing red anymore i don't see why when you are older you should try and make yourself look older in fact the older you are the younger you should try and look right the younger you are you can afford to look older does it make sense if you're eighteen year old you don't mind looking thirty because even if you look thirty cause even if you look thirty you're not that old but the time you're sixty you should try and look like forty okay i tell you when i didn't realise it's so important age is so important until i started teaching and there's this a very matured chinese american chinese who come to me and she walked into my studio and she said i want to see jill and she sat next to me and she said are you jill she was very word screening me all the way down i said yes i am jill why'd you expect me to be forty years old we talk over the phone she thought i was forty years old and i said i'm going to teach you how to be forty looking like me and after that she has completely different face she realised that you can be forty looking like me you understand the different it doesn't mean you are forty you must look like forty alright now it's got nothing to do with your age colours that you can wear whether it's your hair colour your spectacles right down to your socks and shoes that you wear has got nothing to do also with how fair or how dark you are otherwise all the indians must wear same colour okay i tell you one big problem here we took four years to get the right to do it here because the american claim that we chinese are all the same we're all fair skinned dark hair dark eyes you just turn around and look at all your friends many of you've got dark hair but many of you do not have black hair do you understand a lot of people tell you have but you don't have black hair that's the big difference okay so we are not interested in how fair or how dark you are and also we are not interested in how fat or how thin you are at this moment colour cannot make a person look slim have you ever heard of people saying that you are fat you wear black you look slim how many of you have raise your hand when you are fat you make yourself black say you look slimmer now remember that black is one of the one of the strongest attention drawing colours of all colours so if you are fat and you wear black the first thing people see is the black and there there you're fat can you hear as i've mentioned that there's nothing wrong being fat and there's nothing wrong being thin and there's nothing wrong being old it takes you to like your fat it takes you like yourself and old people can see you that see that you grow and respectable and gracefully okay now what'll be a good example from word is can you imagine two women who got fat legs going to a party going to a function and one is very conscious about it so she wear black to make her look slim the other think that you know it's not a problem because my my legs are not that gorgeous i might as well just wear pink colour so nobody can see now these two women go to the party one in black stocking one in pink colour stocking now who do you think will look obviously in this fabric the one in black isn't it so what more it is on the whole length on the body everybody will notice that you're fat are you clear now so remember all the more you're fat you should stay away from black to make a person look slim or fat is is found on the clothing the fabric that you can use the print of the fabric alright the length and the detail the cut of the clothing not the colour okay the colours that you can wear relates to your skin colour or the print word word you call it warm-cool warm or cold now how do you see it's warm and cool a person who is warm looks golden they get freckles easily so people who are warm looks bronzy they just stay dark and brown all the time they are the ones who can carry umbrella wherever they go they will still look so warm they are the ones who can use seven-day scrub imagine if they scrub everyday scrub no use right they just look bronzy when they get dark they look very dark like bill crosby you know bill crosby they're very dark brown to black word you call them now the cool ones are porcelain-pale white ones porcelain-pale white ones those are the people where you see them they're porcelain white by the time they get suntan or baking themselves for two three days in the sun they will only turn red like a lobster but they never look brown okay  they are the ones that eventually when they do get dark they will just look plain burn
