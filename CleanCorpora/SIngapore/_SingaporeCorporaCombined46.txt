she confided in me you know she even said like i don't know whether i am going to enjoy tonight's dinner i think she was kind of feeling a little bit apprehensive about meeting her very popular predecessor uhm oh but it turned out all right in the end because maureen in her usual manner was like uhm full of life uhm full of electricity oh i see oh you mean you really had her doubts ah ya ya but uhm that's what she said i don't know whether i would enjoy tonight's dinner that was precisely why i didn't turn up actually really yes i didn't want to word  because you were afraid of meeting maureen not maureen like i i the point was that i i wasn't sure i would enjoy the dinner because i didn't want to sit in the same at the table as madame oh i got really oh she was pissed off ya she was quite pleasantly charming that evening which was surprising like so out of character but uhm ya yvonne was still here at that time and she she wasn't really invited oh oh and she said i wouldn't even go if they paid me a million bucks so i was beginning to wonder when what what would i be doing there i wouldn't even enjoy myself so that's why i decided to oh but you had every right to be there because it was supposed to be like in celebration of uh the new year's dinner or no no no uhm who's farewell dinner was that tony tan's farewell dinner tony tan ya ya it was supposed to well celebrate all the good work that we have done not really celebrate but it was a thank you dinner for all of us so you had every right to be there more so than me than mabel than ellice it was it was mabel and and sunstroke i didn't do anything for tony tan oh okay and then i like and how was i to know that would that would be like a birthday thing added to it whose birthday was it it's mine oh so then later on later on they they they gave the cake to maureen oh did they give the cake to maureen no it was brought back to the office no no ya but they they wheeled the thing to maureen the trolley oh oh doreen ya doreen sounded so much like maureen ya hang on a minute hello uh ya get back to you okay bye who was that uh den dennis lah oh checking on you i don't know he was quite cheesed off about that that talk that i had with that gentleman yesterday what gentleman was that the one that you said that you insisted was wearing a wig oh really uhm but dennis shouldn't be jealous of every man you speak to especially as this one is like uh golden opportunity for you ya but he with the golden hair uhm the way you put it golden opportunity now the thing is uhm he just is and uhm he but then i side-track and console him by saying that oh don't worry about me echon word says he looks fuuny you know even she wasn't impressed at all and she was insist she insisted that he was wearing a wig you can't for the life of him be real you know real hair so he said uh okay maybe there is something in the way you describe all these men to him maybe no all i could that's why he's always so jealous all i could have to say is he's a male and okay that's it out comes the horns and the green shade and what not oh is it all right if he were to speak to females it's okay it's perfect okay right ah he reckons that i am a dangerous person oh i suppose like really like maybe i suppose if he finds it difficult to resist you he probably believes that all men feel this way what a joke what a real joke no i don't think that's the case i think he is just plain jealous spot word  do you know that yesterday anyway uh men are so unreasonable you know definitely i mean they're like they are still living in the stone age uhm they have double standards uhm uhm then what else can we think of ya i must similar problems with my boyfriend too really i thought he was so cool word  so that's why his friends keep tabs on you ah well he thinks i am damn helpless uh he probably is not aware that i am so much more intelligent than him in every way ah how does he know i am not pretending to be helpless just to make him feel good that's why i tell you men are so damn stupid no oh ya that's what i go through i always play the like fragile dame damsel in distress and he that's what that was the term that he used for to describe me fragile oh that's exactly the term that my boyfriend uses to describe me too really oh yes i mean you find it hard to believe right knowing me that's why that's why they don't know what they're talking about you know they're just so stupid fragile fragile ah okay uhm well i suppose like uhm they have this uhm sort of believe dreams that they want their women to be this way they want their women to be that way you know and they always want to play hero they want to be the hero oh ya so tough but in my case he likes it that i am independent and and he wishes you to be more independent than you already are or to show him no that you are more independent than what you are showing him now actually he allows me to be independent because i am supposed to be on home ground so i cannot go round right being on home ground gee what a weird way of thinking i think that that's where you can go wrong definitely wrong because you are more familiar with the territory uhm that's right and you can be up to more nonsense than ya true if you're on foreign ground ya because this is your territory quite true but anyway what he doesn't know doesn't wouldn't hurt him right uhm no his rationale is that well i'm in home ground so i can be allowed a lot more freedom but later on when we move away and i am in a strange land than i think he would sort of keep uh closer tabs ya that's right really i think so so no wonder you were saying is like bye bye to freedom in more ways than one no he probably thinks that uhm that you know i'll behave myself when i am here because uhm well but you know over there i might not behave myself so much oh is her right i think he's wrong i'll probably behave myself there anyway i don't have time to go around ya you'll probably be so busy and caught up with your work uhm okay lah let's not talk about men they're such boring subjects ya but you kind of live with them you can't live without them oh that's what they say about us too right who said that uh i seem to remember hearing these words just uh a few days ago were you the one who said it nope not me who told me the same thing it's a common phrase so you know oh but someone one said it and in this context too when we're talking about men no that person was talking about women oh and he was saying like you can't live with them and you can't live without them he was referring to women now who was it uh ah well i guess that's my boyfriend's right i have too many boy-friends can't remember i don't know who tells me what uhm okay probably okay let's get back to our office politics here you know that's more interesting so what do you think will happen now if uhm our friend maureen comes back oh but she'll be so much it it'll be so much if she comes back and when i'm still around but not likely to be i suppose probably not but uhm well i heard from somebody that she actually she she actually stepped on a few toes while she was here she steps on her toes oh and but but she is a great favourite with the boss ya but like if she step on her toes than why the hell does she we're all excreted to oh well i think she has been specifically instructed by the man himself to say that we're so happy to hear that you're coming back you know and all that uh i tell you that woman can be so double faced you know probably well are you going out to lunch uh i had my lunch uhm and actually i had a very heavy lunch had potatoes and had salad i where potato kentucky fried chicken you know oh you went out the soft potato that whipped potato you went out no actually it was yesterday's one i couldn't finish it i couldn't eat it at all in the fridge oh you're ribbons are quite nice yap so you just tie actually uhm how much did it cost you buy these ribbons uhm if you get a ready made one it's sixty cents but if you get the whole roll like you know something like this it's two bucks oh ya then you can make i suppose it's more economical ya what it's so troublesome i mean i did one to show jenny jenny's daughter how to do it and that was it i never expected her to like come back and say please ask me to make another one uhm uh so well hack 'cause i'm not doing anything anyway i told ellice very flatly i have lost the desire to work and then what happens now i don't know i just wait and see whether that guy's offer comes through if it does i'll be so glad to go away oh where is her now he's somewhere in singapore he'll be here for the next couple of days and after that he's going back to sydney oh and so i don't know ha has he got your address he may write to you from there he's going to fax me from sydney would it be wise so i mean people would be able to read you know your letters uhm maybe he should write to you instead of faxing well i gave him the card my card here and i i could always get in touch with him before i leave so uhm i hope well anyway even after you leave and you expect faxes i can take them for you and pass it to you so no problem okay no no i not that worried 'cause jenny's the one closest to the fax so she's on the look out oh ya that's right you know so that's okay you know uhm but make sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands because you'll never know i know i know our bosses are like dead curious i think because like both of them saw me with him and if and they were pretty curious judging from the expressions because like miss ng walking up and down three times and even when he was in my room she like went to and fro mabel's room a couple of times and each time non fail she look in and sakuma was passing like walking up and down like for no apparent reason  and of all things he was driving up the road when we were walking down
