""
yvonne
""
there you are
""
sorry sorry  word 
""
where's the rest of eighty two
""
did the rest of you bring the textbook
""
okay right get  word 
""
sit
""
let's start
""
okay before we begin that's brenda lee
""
she's here from the university and she's just taping us
""
please don't go multiple sicion and shut up
""
okay
""
we do need to get on with this
""
alright fine
""
what
""
ah yes well never mind
""
it's it's a bit of unavoided since that's already there okay
""
right we're going to go through much ado and last week we started
talking about  word 
""
yes
""
yes we did  word 
""
we did talk about
""
did we go through it in detail
""
no
""
alright
""
let's start with that because you need to be absolutely sure how this
text works
""
now please be highly conscious that this is identical to lear in
terms of perceptions
""
you are going to always one of the principles that there is no one
view about love that's presented by shakespeare
""
but you're rather going to have ah multiple views presented by the
multiple sets of characters
""
now we've identified this now
""
who are the sets of characters who are directly in the issue of love
""
okay beatrice and benedict
""
okay claudio and hero and margaret
""
the announcer  word  hero
""
ya
""
okay why are you late
""
alright quick
""
okay recap right
""
we're talking about the aspect of love
""
i don't like people sitting behind me
""
i can't see them
""
okay right
""
okay let's get on to this okay
""
now the question of time  word 
""
is this that you need figure out
""
what are the kinds of views about love represented in the sets
""
the starting point has always got to be the kind of character love
""
let's try and pick one particular group
""
okay can we start with hero and claudio
""
and remember what we said
""
it's always easy if you have the same like love is something or love
is shown to be something like in lear
""
okay we saw that love can be ungrateful
""
okay or we came to understand that people's love cannot be quantified
because of the behaviour of lear okay where he attempts to drive cordelia
""
to quantify it you find that it doesn't work
""
love does not always have to be forgiving
""
it can be merciless as well
""
right now do you see  word  of love in much ado
""
what are the angles
""
let's start with hero and claudio
""
okay that love can be superficial
""
alright  word 
""
can somebody pick it up please
""
what do we mean by love can be superficial
""
mean what
""
uh huh okay
""
right
""
okay so that love can be at the top level  word 
where there is the use of sight okay
""
you see and you respond you may not go beyond that yes that love can
be based on ignorance as well
""
right
""
that's an idea that comes across that there is potential where love
can be based on ignorance
""
ignorant
""
okay so that will be the example to prove that
""
what else is it
""
what else
""
do we get caught
""
this this object topic of love by shakespeare's presentation
""
you say love is naive okay
""
are you using hero and claudio specifically
""
can you give specific examples
""
yes specific example we're sorting in the text that specifically show
themselves to be naive about the concept of love  word 
""
and so
""
and what now
""
about the love for them
""
right
""
can we all agree with that
""
anybody have difficulties with that
""
leonard what time is it
""
where were you
""
didn't you get the message
""
alright come on in
""
okay
""
right
""
so you have decided there is naive  word  love
 word  because of the fact we don't like judge 
word  and unlike of what's going on rather you look around and you
use information from secondary sources
""
is love fickle
""
is that the same as love being naive
""
prove that love is okay but do you think that  word
 that in the relationship between hero and claudio you see that
love is fickle
""
uh huh but what does he change
""
opinion
""
so
""
what does love become
""
right
""
that's a better way of putting it
""
in this case one sees the double relationship between love and trust
""
okay how is this relation what should be the ideal state
""
okay
""
okay
""
alright let's just  word  we've got two lines
about this
""
one is that hero does sorry hero does the dying bit and claudio
registers no emotion so the argument here here is love is fickle or frivolous
because it is swayed
""
are you using a different point audrey
""
okay now audrey's point is that he only goes to hero when he wants
something and when he doesn't want it or it seems that he's not getting the
whole quality of what he should be getting he drops it
""
he picks it up again with
""
it's quite clear she's innocent so there's a frivolity to his
attitude towards love
""
it's not treated as a stable thing
""
it's more an imbalance thing where he moves from pole to pole
""
is that the same being fickle
""
alright what is that
""
can we try a better word for fickle or frivolous for this thing that
where you say i will love you if you love me back equal proportionately
""
selfish
""
conditional
""
what else
""
love meets your expectations
""
yes a very
""
what
""
merit
""
love has no merit
""
okay where you set a value and if that value is not responded to
what do
""
we don't want to  word  so it's condition
""
okay
""
but ya i'm willing to accept the argument  word 
that maybe the love here is fickle fickle
""
i'm going to accept that argument and the counter-ar argument going
on as well that you know maybe it is because he's so hurt he does these
things to hero so therefore his love is true
""
okay
""
point he's  word  being miserable when she is
dead
""
okay now you're all not going to resolve this one
""
so some of you have resolved versus  word  two
polar views about how you're going to look at claudio
""
one of you obviously is not a claudio fan quite clear okay but
 word  so he's okay
""
please let's not go into those kind of analysis but yes there are
multiple responses
""
it's exactly like the lear
""
get used to it
""
the comedy you may think you hate it but  word 
""
alright let's go on
""
what other aspects of love can you see
""
with hero and claudio at work
""
try and think about the way they enter this love relationship
""
conventional ya
""
it's a display of conventionality that surrounds love and marriage
okay
""
okay can we please explain the conventionality go on to the
 word  idea
""
ya one claudio woos her by proxy
""
what is already wrong if you woo by proxy
""
yes you aren't understanding somebody else
""
what does that mean about your own understanding if you send
somebody else
""
you don't actually understand the person or uh you can't use the
word insulting
""
why would it not be correct to use the fact that it'll be insulting
to the other person if you woo by proxy
""
right this is the convention at that time that argument is 
word 
""
it's the convention of the period that you could do this but given
that what does it do to your love relation
""
ya
""
you yourself lack knowledge alright
""
and please remember the issue of knowledge and love  word
""
""
knowledge what
""
you tell me
""
who
""
who said what
""
leonard where where are you
""
leonard if you hide behind the chair
""
okay what knowledge of what
""
each other
""
ya okay
""
so you've got that element to consider as well
""
right
""
elaine had the idea that love here is seen to be rash
""
why rash
""
right there is the  word  of her naive
""
isn't the way naive is
""
okay fine you got to  word  to that
""
who wants this
""
everybody you got the argument it's rash and you also have the
argument that it is a sign of real love because didn't  word
 say love him marry him
 convention dictates that you shall all the laws lay down their father
 so hero displays that conventional kind of behaviour
 yet can we ask the question what is the clear proof that their
love is rash
 what would you use
 what evidence in the text indicates
 one week
 good
 that's right
 please try and remember it's a comedy because actions get pushed
together
 there's a willingness on the part of the audience to suspend
incredulity
 you  word  you willingly allow time to pass
 you must never forget that the theatre works by that method that
you have a squashed perception
 there's such a thing as stage time against real time
 in stage time there's credibility to the action
 in real time you stop to think about it it's one week
 just like lear gets in to his kingdom divides it gets shut up by
one daughter moves on to another and to another
 within a month
  word  you're being tremendously generous there
 how many days you think
 ya two three days
 you're talking about a squashed action and his whole rise and fall
 ya exactly  word  if you  word
 count it the whole rise and fall can't take more than a week and a
half
 but this is the same thing  word  a marriage
 we're talking about a marriage between two individuals who never
see each other who know nothing about each other except the superficiality
and half the time that they spend together before the marriage what kind of
state are they
 they're never alone
 what else
 they're masked
  word  big ball
 they're masked
 they never see each other
 it's almost as if it were a metaphor the way they are themselves
they never have knowledge
 they all wear a kind of mask
 yes uhm yes yes there is an idealization
 look for it in your  word  as well
 the same way  word  idealizes  word
  word 
 he sees her as a heroic figure
 ya when your ideal so that you have a  word  of
a kind of romantic ideal at work
 with this idea of convention love you have a romantization of
object of myself which is what claudio has been guilty of
 okay everybody is still here and awake
 we're not dying yet are we
 okay fine
 okay do you get an idea what we're doing with this text
 it's the same thing with the lear only we're going at a different
level  word  very deeply
 two themes
 one is love other will be appearance versus reality
 okay can we drop hero and claudio for a moment
 can we look at beatrice and benedick
 i think we've found  word  almost too dry
 alright what about beatrice and benedick
 what comes to mind automatically if we're asked to justify the
presentation of love by those two characters
 love through understanding
 i see  word  eyebrow that seems to indicate
that  word  argument
 okay who's going to support love through understanding
 okay yes  word 
 what what are they
 between the two of them what are they
 ya that's right
 they are they  word  uh huh
 you you have to find shakespeare
 can't tell you that
 what do you think
 okay the argument here is do they un do they fall in love because
of understanding or is understanding something that arises later on
 it's there so you think they fall in love with understanding uh
huh
 so there's you mean there's no choice but to understand uh huh
 right so what do you say his love is based on
  word  anguish language
 why
 it's a very interesting idea
 right you got it
 so you
 can i modify your statement
 you said based on language language is based on communication
because they use a tool they are she's got she's got the half of the problem
there that that they are the two who talk 
 even if they fight at least they are talking it's not a case
where hero wants nothing but to say 'i shall  word  ' and
claudio does nothing but listen very well to everybody else and not talk to
hero right so there's always the use of the proxy now your idea of proxy
comes  word  by using proxy to communicate in the affairs
of love there it becomes insulting for an audience to believe okay so you've
got to try and draw the line where is conventionality acceptable where isn't
it and how can the lack of communication mar a relationship especially in the
issue of love okay go on okay so what are you then saying okay right well
it's as you can see right on this small subject we're already having multiple
views about these characters we're going to try and reconcile these yes we're
going and get a part of the problem here are we then saying that they are so
similar that they fail to see each other because they can't or are we saying
that they are so similar they must see each other what then is your stand for
the two of them they're too proud right the issue of pride  word
 alongside communication somebody brought up the idea of scornful
love okay this is where you're going to talk about pride impeding in love
alright even though they have knowledge of each other what do they fail to
have knowledge of other  word  they have knowledge of each
other what do they fail in themselves right that's where you get it pride
impedes
