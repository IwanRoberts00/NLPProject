 cecilia after a while you will you will ask question
like okay understand 
""
""
ya
""
""
and after a while all your vocab is down the drain
""
""
actually it's quite true you know
""
because uh like when i was teaching uh sometimes when when you have
to speak their level sometimes you may have to even speak bro broken english
you know
""
""
ya
""
""
in order that they understand you know
""
""
ya ya
""
""
not for your own sake but for their sake you may have to
 so if for i mean if you do that for long alright you fear
that maybe
your standard of english will deteriorate also
""
""
definitely
""
""
most most probably ya
""
""
so you all better watch out
""
one of these day i'll be speaking in broken english
""
""
you don't say you know 'a' not me you all don't know
""
even for me uh i work in the library cos i have to conduct course
visits right
""
""
ah
""
""
for the for students
""
i mean when they come uh and some of them lah they're from very bad
schools i mean from the quite lousy schools okay
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and so when i talk to them
""
and i if i want to make myself understood let's say to the lower
primaries at primary two primary four and they're from  word
 courses uh i've to
""
i've i've to do that too
""
i always quite embarrassing because there's a teacher who's sitting
behind and then they say huh even the librarian also speak like that nuh
""
but i may have to do it because like one teacher told me
""
you know wah you speak so good english to them they won't
understand you you know
""
""
it's true
""
it's strange
""
""
ya that's what they told me
""
""
but you have no such trouble like mine
""
""
so
""
""
uhm not really
""
i don't think i have usually
""
uh i have to speak business english with the bankers
""
""
ya i think
""
""
 word  english
""
""
be more professional lah you know
""
""
i think peck see probably won't have won't have that kind of
problem lah
""
""
because
""
""
ya
""
""
i mean if you're if you're talking to bankers
""
""
in fact the bankers that i i dealt with uh most of them are
overseas graduates so they slang a bit when i talk to them
""
can can tell lah
""
this slang
""
""
i hated people who slang
""
wah i can't stand it and i can't understand
""
that's the worst part
""
""
ya lor
""
""
aiyah
""
""
'a' then we're talking about the tour
""
how uh
""
i mean what did you find out
""
""
are you are you going
""
""
oh  word 
""
""
'a' are you going or not
""
are you keen or not
""
""
what should i say
""
""
okay let me let me present you with the itinerary
""
""
okay
""
""
and the prices
""
""
which part of june
""
you said what what tour agency is that
""
""
okay okay uh sunny sunny serves
""
""
sunny
""
""
uh which part of june
""
""
which part of june uh
""
""
i mean
""
""
it's probably second or third first
""
it's either first second or third of june that we'll be going that
means we'll be departing uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
uhm three days the offer is three days
""
""
uh huh
""
""
uhm actually it was only three nine nine but because june is
the peak season
""
""
ya
""
""
so they add another eighty dollars surcharge so it's about
four seven nine
""
four seven nine uh correct or not
""
""
oh you mean go four seven nine uh
""
""
during that season more expats
""
""
yes
""
""
ya definitely because it's like the our school holiday
""
its peak season you know ya
""
""
it's what it's it's school holiday
""
high season they call it
""
""
ya  word  it'll definitely be more
expensive
""
""
four seven nine
""
the only thing we find it attractive is that additional night is
only thirty dollars and it's four-star hotel
""
""
oh you mean if if you want to extend
""
""
ah
""
""
you stay in in the same hotel
""
""
hotel
""
""
it's only thirty dollars more
""
""
it's only thirty dollars more
""
you can change to another hotel of the same class
""
""
ya 'a' that's not bad what huh
""
""
ya it's quite interesting in the sense you can stay in two
different hotels
""
""
uhm ya ya
""
""
and it's only thirty dollars
""
other other tour agencies fifty to sixty dollars
""
""
and it's four-star lah
""
four-star hotel lah is it
""
""
uhm i think so around there
""
that's why i don't know
""
up to you
""
""
'a' the problem is not
""
""
uhm
""
""
okay what's the itinerary like
""
""
yes yes
""
""
first i thought you said you have financial prob
""
""
i do i do i tell you
""
uh after going to australia and coming back
""
uh i'll be dead broke
""
you know i mean i would dearly loved to go with you cecilia but
the problem is shall i just
""
aiyah what the heck you know i just go
""
""
just ya ya cl &
""
""
go ya ya ya
""
""
yes yes yes you should
""
""
and forget about the money or i should be you know i should
be thrifty and i should be careful now that i'm going to be very poor
""
i don't know what i'm going to do
""
""
uhm uhm
""
i think you can you can just put aside five hundred and you can
have a very nice five four-day holiday
""
""
you tell me  word  ha  in cantonese 
""
""
sufficient or not
""
five hundred
""
""
put aside five hundred dollars
""
""
five hundred
""
you see this is four seven nine
""
""
but you go there you have to buy things what
""
""
okay plus
""
uh that's provided you don't buy things lor
""
""
wait wait wait
""
you said it's four seven nine for three days uh
""
""
ah four seven nine then plus twelve dollars airport tax
""
""
ya
""
""
ya
""
""
but then the food leh
""
do they cover all meals  word 
""
""
they they covered all meals except the fourth uh the third
first second nuh third day
""
third day only breakfast so you settle your own dinner and nuh
lunch
""
""
so two days that means covered except third day dinner and
lunch
""
""
then  word 
""
ah then the fourth day i suppose they give you the breakfast
before you fly off
""
""
wait wait wait wait
""
oh that means it's actually a four-day tour lah
""
""
if you want nuh
""
i'm assuming you go for four days
""
""
so the fourth
""
""
because three days is like too short
""
you see uh first day and second day there'll be tours guided tours
""
you know that means they'll take you
""
they will take us to places
""
""
ya
""
""
and then third day and you go off
""
don't you think it's
""
""
it's four four days
""
that's the seven four seven nine one
""
""
four days
""
it's four
""
""
wah it's more than that you know
""
""
five zero nine five zero nine
""
""
ah
""
""
plus extra thirty dollars
""
""
that's why
""
""
five zero nine
""
""
five zero nine uh
""
so four days it's five zero nine five over hundred dollars already
you know
""
it's not even within the five hundred dollars
""
""
ya
""
cannot then  word  five five zero lor
""
""
cos' like assuming
