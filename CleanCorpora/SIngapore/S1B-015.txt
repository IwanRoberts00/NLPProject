can see or not
""
clear or not
""
i'm nervous you know  laughter 
""
okay
""
ah let me introduce you to this pretty lady here
""
alright she's a good friend of mine
""
her name is brenda koh
""
she's doing a some kind of a research on the kind of english i use
""
right she's from nus okay
""
what i say you no say
""
okay look at the diagram on the board
""
alright
""
now i'm trying to make it easier for you hopefully
""
ya
""
from what i lecture on wednesday you may not understand
""
let's look at it
""
if i put a battery and i connect it directly to a n-type material
what happens
""
is there a current
""
who say there's a current
""
put up your hand
""
one two three four five
""
who said there's a current
""
you all don't know
""
i put up my hand means have lah
""
you all never put up your hands alright
""
there is a current
""
what is the nature of the current
""
infinity
""
what is the measure of the current
""
micro m
""
how do you know micro m
""
current equals to voltage divide by resistance alright
""
the value of the current depends on the voltage and the resistance of
this material alright
""
what is the resistance of the material
""
zero
""
what's the resistance of material
""
n-type material
""
don't know
""
don't know ah
""
know or not
""
know or not
""
any material right
""
resistance equals to rho l over a alright
""
so sectional area is proportional inversely proportional to the
resistance alright
""
now so what happens
""
if i increase the voltage what happen to my current
""
increase or decrease
""
increase okay
""
voltage increase current will increase
""
now what happen if i change this guy
""
alright i said i want to use the n-type material but i want a
narrower strip
""
what happen to the current
""
increase or decrease
""
current decrease right
""
alright area is smaller resistance is bigger current will drop okay
""
so far so good
""
so far so good
""
okay good
""
now your jfet has got one n-type material and two p-type material
there correct
""
okay let's say i put a voltage what happen
""
this junction here what kind of biasing
""
reverse bias
""
this junction
""
reverse bias right
""
reverse bias alright
""
now if it's reverse bias what happen to the depletion region
""
increase or decrease
""
depletion region widens alright so depletion region increase what
happen to my channel
""
my area here
""
how much
""
smaller area right
""
smaller area
""
if i increase my voltage what happen
""
the current bigger but my channel is smaller
""
current smaller right
""
so my current will go bigger but it will not go as much as if there
is no p-type material there alright
""
so if you draw a graph alright or if i take the junction here uh vds
and i draw a graph if this the diagram then as my voltage increases my
current will increase  word  alright
""
but if i put in this p material in between what happen is instead of
going all the way there'll come a point where it will change in the rate of
increase alright
""
so it will start  word 
""
alright the increase will become smaller and smaller and smaller
until a point where the depletion region touches one another it will stop
""
once there's the this depletion region is  word 
formed there is no current alright
""
so the current will remain constant
""
this the case where we say it's equal to idss remember
""
alright now when the depletion region is formed the current becomes
constant
""
why why
""
it's supposed depletion region means no current what how come current
is constant
""
what
""
saturated saturated alright
""
now in your logical mind once it's reverse bias no current can go
through isn't it
""
alright no current can go through which is true
""
alright just that the current can only go through the channel
""
so once the channel is closed no current can go through alright but
we say that this one stays at the saturation level because what happens is
the depletion region no current go through and no current go through the
depletion region will shrink
""
once it shrink the channel is opened current will go again alright
""
when current flow again the depletion grow again
""
so it's a continuous process alright and as it goes on the current
stays at that point
""
alright we call this the saturation current for the jfet
""
can or not
""
okay now next thing
""
i'm going to make it more complicated ah
""
can i let's say i don't consider this voltage
""
put in a voltage here alright
""
put in available voltage here what happen
""
alright in our diagram we call this vgg what happen to the junction
""
forward or reverse bias
""
who said forward bias
""
nobody said forward bias
""
kok fai
""
okay reverse bias right
""
both junctions are reverse bias okay
""
now both under reverse bias what happen
""
same thing
""
depletion region will grow right depending on how big this voltage
is that it will correspond to the growth of your depletion region okay
""
so it can grow a little bit here and a little bit here
""
if it grows like that you'll still have a channel you can pass your
current through alright until a point where if you increase this very high
these two will meet and these two meet there's no more channel
""
no channel no current alright
""
so these are the various conditions that we have in the jfet
""
we have a case where vgs equals zero alright when we disconnect this
guy and put this to ground
""
alright that's the first case where we get this from this diagram
""
then as we increase vgg you get a smaller channel and as you
increase your vdd on this side the channel becomes smaller and smaller again
""
alright but just now the time taken before it reaches saturation is
faster because the channel is already smaller when we first started alright
""
so you'll you will get a value that is smaller alright id will
saturate at a value lower than idss alright
""
and then at the point where vgg equals to your pinch down voltagea
then it will join together and your id equals to zero all the time alright
then you get a case where you call this the pinch down phase id equals to
zero
""
understand
""
yes
""
understood understood ah
""
yes mr eddy
""
do you know what you are asking or not
""
come come come come ask ask
""
can you all hear or not
""
louder lah come on
""
the mike cannot hear hurry up louder
""
okay how come there's a reverse bias to the p and the n
""
let's say i don't have this uh okay
""
that's what you mean right
""
that's what eddy
""
this one is to ground is it
""
have to connect to ground what
""
don't connect to ground how
""
must have got return path what
""
alright just now i draw i don't put the ground because put the
ground confuse people what
""
supposed to have the ground an question answered right
""
okay any more or not
""
can understand
""
okay once you understand we can go on
""
common-source
""
forward transconductance very chim term but actually don't worry
about the definition alright
""
it sounds very long doesn't matter all you need to remember is this
formula okay
""
this guy equals to this
""
that's what it means alright
""
ah i told you before engineers define things by equations so here we
define gm as a common-source forward transconductance as change in id over
change in vds for constant value or for a value of vds equals to zero that
means to shock the you shock the drain source voltage alright
""
this is current divide by voltage which is a conductance
""
alright conductance is measured in  word 
""
alright typical values from one to ten  word 
""
now this this parameter can be found in your datasheets as per all
the other alright same as all the rest
""
okay this one is mathematics alright
""
this equation we know uh id equals to idss into one minus vgs over
vp square
""
gm equals to this alright
""
differentiate okay
""
you all mathematicians differentiate this id with respect to vgs
alright
""
so vgs is your variable that you differentiate with respect to
alright the differentiation
""
take down the two so you get two idss equal vp alright
""
put down the whatever inside here alright
""
differentiate here  word 
""
outside alright
""
i hope i integrated or differentiated properly alright
""
then i don't want a negative sign so i put it inside here okay
""
mathematics is sound nuh
""
my maths okay uh
""
now this value two idss divide by vp we give it another parameter
name we call this gm0 alright
""
gm nought
""
gm nought equals to this so that gm equals to this one
""
it's easy to remember easier to remember
""
now this gm nought is defined as the maximum ac gain parameter of
serving an a bias of vgs equals to zero
""
well that's a definition of gm zero
""
now what you need to know is alright what you need to know is these
formulas alright these two
""
that's all you need to know alright
""
now the other characteristics that you can find in a jfet is found
in your datasheet is this drain source on resistance
""
when when the drain source is on alright when you use as a switch
you have it on off alright
""
so on resistance is when the switch is on okay
""
what is the value of the resistance at the drain to the source that
is what you measure alright and it ranges from ten to few hundred ohm
""
this is another parameter that you can you need to know how to
define okay
""
what's the time now
""
okay the time is thirty
""
i can go on
""
have i finished two thousand words
""
not yet ah
""
i no voice already
""
actually i plan to stop here one you know but i haven't reached two
thousand words so i must carry on alright
""
okay never mind it's very fast alright
""
the next topic is another kind of stp we call this the metal oxide
semiconductor fet alright in short we call this mosfet m-o-s vp mosfet
alright
""
now mosfet is the way it functions is something like jfet with a
little bit of difference alright and it's constructed with a gate terminal
insulated from the channel that means instead of well my gate is these two
""
instead of the two gates connected directly to the channel i use an
insulator to insulate it alright
""
that's what it does right and the insulating material is called
silicon dioxide that's the materials
""
alright and there are two types of mosfet one is called the
depletion mosfet and it works very much like the jfet and then the other one
is called the enlargement mosfet which works almost entirely differently
alright
""
depletion mosfet now this diagram can be found in your book uh
""
the transparency not clear you can book
""
okay i have again the drain and the source alright
""
the these are the n-type regions okay
""
the drain and the source is connected to the n-type the n channel
alright the gate is connected to the p-substrate  word 
the p-type
""
so it forms something like this the same thing alright
""
so you find that here there's a channel on this side p alright the n
is this one p surrounding all over the all over
""
but this is just a sectional view
""
it's not the it's not it's a piece  word  imagine
a piece of block alright it's inside with the p-sucstrate all over alright
surrounding it not just what you see alright the p-substrate is surrounding
it
""
so the same thing applies alright p-type substrate n-type channel
okay
""
now the symbol is this one alright
""
this a symbol for the depletion mosfet source drain a alright and
the arrow pointing inwards is what you call the p-substrate alright 
""
if the substrate is n then the arrow pointing outwards alright i'll
show you the graph afterwards okay n channel is physically constructed and
embedded in the struc in the in the substance alright basically what i what i
do okay i make a piece of n n-type and then i have the p-type i'll just
squeeze it in something like that that's what it means okay how to do it so
if when go for a  word  factory visit uh go and find out
the current will flow between the drain and the source of the voltage
connected across drain and source same thing as uh that one alright i connect
it here from here to here i'll get a current going like that alright so this
my my  word  connect to the n channel it will flow like
that alright go across the channel okay how come not the other way
conventional current flow is like that electron flow is like that okay it's
how i it's how you put in your voltage source alright now you put in the the
same thing applies there right the same kind of uh phenomenon that means if i
if i put in the voltage the current will flow as the current flow the
depletion region form and so on alright then the current saturate the same
the same thing happens okay
