friends it's very difficult to come in at the tail end of this
distinguished company not least because like uh john silkin
""
uhm i also found the the type of forum rather rather daunting
dauntingly bored but uhm i'll do my best like mr silkin and ramble on for
five or ten minutes and then perhaps we can go along with some questions if
you have questions for any of us
""
uhm i haven't brought with me my books otherwise we'll read
something from that that will take up five minutes
""
but uhm what i'll do instead is is just present one or two thoughts
on this type of creativity and genre uhm most have difficulty with that word
actually pronouncing it the second word whether or not i'm pronouncing it
correctly now
""
uhm the the first thing i think that confronts an asian writer
anyway uhm is something more fundamental than than genre and something which
mr lee has mentioned uh which is really the issue of language
""
what language does one write in to start with
""
uhm for me i never had any choice because my own writing 
word  uhm and i think for many singaporeans many young singaporean
writers that's really the case now because of the young singaporeans are
writing in english
""
uhm i personally don't feel that is something we should be
embarrassed or ashamed about and and uh i i certainly sympathise with mr lee
and uh with you know uhm it's an awkward position that he's taken
""
but nonetheless writing in the language other than uhm one's uh
one's ancestral tongue from my father's side my ancestral tongue is tamil uh
and i regret to say i i wasn't able to understand mr ramisamy's poems my own
inadequacies
""
uhm but i think that one of the things which one has to consider is
that writing in in english language there is the question of of genre in
which you of of of of the traditions from which you want to borrow
""
uhm i think it's exciting to to to to hear uh what mr ha professor
hasmiah's his poems which attempt to use the persian or urdu form of bizarre
and transpose that to the english language
""
uhm i think that's something which which singaporean writers had to
be concerned about uhm the because when one writes in english as a
singaporean in a way one can face a situation where one's writing is very
thin because we don't we seem to have lost our history by writing in this
other language
""
uhm and we have to i think consciously strive perhaps more
consciously than people who are writing in within a a fixed tradition
""
we have to strive more consciously to pull hang on to some of those
those those tradition to build up our own resource
""
and i think one of the great things done in singapore is that uh
we're not although we may be cut off in one sense from an ancestral tradition
the fact is that when we cut off from many ancestral traditions so we can
borrow from all of those ancestral traditions
""
and so in a way hopefully perhaps through these pieces of project
of mine or and of others both a language built on literature which is strong
because it can draw from all these many sources and not be ashamed about
doing so
""
and perhaps i i i could just mention one or two ways in which i've
been trying to do this
""
uhm first of all my my first book first loves doesn't fall within
any genre that i know of
""
i i have been confronted from time to time by academics uh asking
me you know well what are you trying do and where does this structure from
""
uhm frankly i i i don't know uhm it's uh the the book really
consist in short stories about a group of friends growing up but uhm the the
the stories are structured in a particular way uhm and nestled within this
within a structure are stories written from other people's viewpoints
""
uhm really i never thought about the structure before starting to
write or to go through naturally other with a curiosity to find out more
about the characters and so worked through it write other stories
""
uhm and i think in a way genre of course is is something which
critics abet to give themselves here something to do to comment say
""
ah these are the conventions of this genre these are the
conventions of that genre
""
uhm but of course it's still useful as as hashmir said because you
have these conventions to take off the gates
""
traditions are things you you build on and you react against
""
uhm but i will skip one or two one or two examples
""
first of all perhaps a a rather uhm a rather uhm uhm deciduous
example uhm in in in singa well in malaysia and singaporean history there's
an important book for this
""
sejarah melayu which is basically a a chronicle of uhm of the
history of malacca and also to some extent the history of singapore as it it
is its first incarnation as a as a city state as a trading port in the
thirteenth century uhm
""
and i think that's an important resource for us even if we're
working not in malay but in english
""
uhm stella kon has used uhm passages examples from sejarah melayu
i've also done so uhm
""
when i say it's deciduous example because i i've used in one of my
stories uh the episode of the sword fish attack on singapore which many of
you are probably uh familiar with it about how the the the the genius of a
little boy saved singapore from this this terrible terrifying sword fish
attack
""
sword fish were coming and flying onto the beach and killing
everybody and so it's a pretty serious situation but this little boy had the
idea of of cutting down banana stems and building a barricade and of course
you can imagine what happened to the sword fish uh course that  word
 stop him
""
the sword stuck in the bamboo in the banana stems and that was it
they were they were easily killed
""
at least that's what how the story goes
""
but uhm that's not the really important point of the story
""
the important point of the story is that uh the the uh the ruler of
that time far from uhm uhm congratulating uhm the little boy recognise it ah
yes here is a threat to uh to my power and uh had the boy executed uhm
""
and that of course was was the the point of the story
""
but i'm i use it in in in a story of mine using it totally
deciduously but uhm still trying to work through some of these ideas and
bring them into my own writing
""
uhm where i had a couple of young boys competing for the attention
of a of a young girl uhm in the way that goes on all the time
""
and the the secret weapon which one of them wheels in or unleashes
and successfully wins the girl
""
the girl's attention at any rate though there are complications
later on
""
uhm he's to produce this story and captivate them with his story
uhm uh whereas the other the other boy doesn't have this historical depth to
win that particular fight
""
uhm more seriously perhaps uhm i've uhm tried to to use from not
only literary resources but also some of the historical things around
singapore
""
uhm uhm for example one of my short stories tries to tries to work
on the uhm a a a monument in cambodia called the bayon who tries to make
certain uh good  word  imagination to make certain
comparisons suggest certain warnings
""
uhm generally just to play around with this this image of the bayon
this monumental achievement uhm of a kingdom which shortly thereafter
disintegrated uhm and compare that with with raffles place our own monumental
achievement
""
uhm and i i've also tried to work with uhm with some chinese
literary traditions uhm particularly with the dream of the red chamber in
first loves
""
i i worked off that quite a lot
""
it's one of the episodes in in in that uhm because i think there
are there are qualities of of of of sensibility which are things we should
not lose which we can rework and bring bring into singaporean literature
""
uhm perhaps i've i've said enough
""
anybody who might like to go  word 
""
thank you 
""
""
""
uhm today's talk uh entitled writer beyond labels
""
so can you all hear me at the back
""
i think i wanted to approach this from several ways but if i could
start for instance very simple
""
something i wrote there's nothing wrong in the world when you were
your young and people ask you want to do
""
they mean do you want to be a doctor engineer a lawyer pilot what
""
if you think you want to be kinder or knowledgable writer they
think you're crazy
""
you're here i understand because you're young have written and
believe want to write some more
""
i'm here because i'm not so young uh i have written and some
believe that i am a writer
""
so if i'm a writer and you inspire to be writers then question
central question is what can i tell you about becoming a writer
""
that's i think the underlying thing this whole programme it's a
very important question to think for
""
i want to start from the first question if not start  word
 but the talk today focuses on one thing
""
first who and what is a writer
""
that's the first label i wish to mention in speaking to you today
""
uh in a sense entitled writer: beyond labels the first label is
writer
""
uhm i think the writer's image is cast in the popular imagination
""
it's a bit of a mixture amalgam of well-known sometimes famous
writers sometimes not so famous writers or infant writers uhm and i think we
all have our image of what a writer is or should be
""
hence sometimes brooding wearing all black
""
i remember i went to a college once the teacher told that in three
years of after speaking to them i was the first one who went up not wearing
all black
""
uh the writer should be even tragic of course intelligent witty
grand in some ways also struggling because all writers and artist should
struggle
""
eccentric strange different sometimes i know we all have our little
images of the writers may think of where we think what people understand
""
some of us may be hemmingway  word  thomas
 word  black uh jack kerouac some  word
 and those of you who are really into asian literature well you can
name them
""
uh but for those of us who are english rightly or wrongly may have
these images of what stumped the revolt of becoming a writer uh
""
and sorry so accurately or inaccurately directly or indirectly
these and other writers
""
i haven't mention come to mind when we think of writing writer
""
that's good i think that's good that it helps us decide on the
various paths we can take path path you should take
""
and it also comforts us to know that there the others who have
travel on that path before us uh
""
for example when i started writing uhm one of the real reasons i'm
involved in creative arts programme not so much as much as i am uhm is
because of another poet doctor edwin thumboo who is in charge of this
programme
""
when i was about your age yes i was once your age uh prof thumboo
spent a lot of time helping me in my writing uh airing out correction and
gave some suggestions built in helped many writers in singapore 
""
so since of locally as well as the foreigner images i mentioned
it's good for us because we know that there are things we aspire to or even
surpass and they are people to look towards as models in a sense
