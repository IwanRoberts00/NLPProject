that's why she's a gospel singer she's got that and she sold her look you know i like uhm ya and she's so gorgeous ya young and then these these women would be checking her up talking to her finding out about her women i think just casual conversation you see cos she's so young and they were so amazed after she left then you know i just met this girl who was going to school you know all by herself and there was this little girl on the greyhound too and she cried all the way she cried the first part of the way she's crying like mad because her mum put her on the bus to go with her father report her oh shit poor girl how old is she eight maybe nine trauma ya she i don't know i was taking the bus greyhound from uh chicago to indiana oh what happened was i missed the the word  was so funny cos i took about i thought it would just take an hour for me to get from where i was in chicago down downtown you see to the bus station little did i know when i went it was rush hour oh god i and the bus journey was like hell so by the time i got there i got to the tracks i was like where's the train and then there was a station master there and i said uhm where is the train that's bound for indiana uhm maam you see those tail lights over there you're right that's the one uh oh shit so word greyhound and uhm this was during the time when the uhm the floods had just been over and everyone was talking about it so i was seated right at the back and there were a couple of black guys and initially it was very i was like uh then then after all they started talking uhm you know uh what what is that they said uhm ya that's it had i been in chicago earlier this uhm earlier this week i mean i would have gone downtown and caught me a carp you you know what happened to the floods you hear about the floods don't know ya ya they've they flooded the building oh the entire basement see what happened was uhm these jokers while building the subway had driven a wall right down through uhm was it the city's foundations i don't know anyway while they were building something they had driven a wall right down through a subway see a really old wall and that has lasted for about a decade until now because of the i think the river was coming upstream or something and then it just word the dam and all the basement stuff all i mean everything you know from word  to the area everything was downtown chicago right all the basements were flooded millions and millions of bucks and it's like chicago isn't exactly a rich city either and uhm plus the riots and everything it just made things a lot worse so ya ya it was just great because there was an oriental family with us and uhm you'll be amazed to find there are a lot of blacks in america still think that there's a lot of i don't know it's just amazing the amount of prejudice they have against the whites and the whites against them imaginary and real and and as when i told this friend that i made it to indiana about what had happened on the bus he asked me how many orientals were there and i said aside from me there were about five of us really at two am in the morning and i said ya and you know what was even more surprising there was this black guy who offered to help the uhm well he was seated at the back and so one of the kids fell asleep you see the mum wanted to move him up he just picked up the kid and put him down you know it's like and he helped me put my bag up and everything and and so he said you know things are really changing now i said oh really uhm it it's just it's like the kind of stuff you read in books only thing that it's becoming real you know you see it there uhm oh of course you're reading books from them ya i know ya and and when i was in chicago i went to universities a lot there was a students' discussion i took part in but actually it was more an informal thing was at jimmy's the students' bar i went there i was the only oriental there the entire group ostracized me okay tsk habis man oh my god really uhm they didn't even speak to me they looked at me of course and then word me back with uhm you know that kind of thing and i was like okay i'll just sit and i'll listen to what you're saying oh really after a while nobody was talking to me anymore in fact nobody began to there was some newcomer with me as well but she was uhm she looked more like them oh so after a while i just got up and i said to my friend look i think i want to leave now and he was white then i went up i said what the hell was going on back there uhm uh and for the next hour and a half there was a white-bashing session oh uhm uhm they're sick yeah and i was really amazed these were masters students very talented brilliant people who have travelled a lot very widely oh they must be from oh obviously they are not brilliant enough they must be from no they must be from the upper classes probably upper middles lah anyway yeah brought up in a kind of environment which is only white you know but you'd be finding the prejudice coming from the lower classes as well they come from all classes then even upper upper middle people they can be very nice people uhm i mean they had a lot of comments about my english and oh you speak very good english oh they are always amazed but then i guess someone told me i i felt it was quite patronizing yes it was but then someone told me wouldn't you react the same way if you see a white speaking chinese ya that's true and i thought ya but it's just very funny when they speak to you slowly oh ya and they have a look in the eye like saying are you getting what i'm saying are you getting what i'm saying it's very funny oh ya i had an experience here in singapore it's about there's this australian chap first time in the orient i hate the word orient it's like something you described word first right ya uh that's right like victorian times they call this place suh ya really ancient you know like we're totally it's like it's like it's like we're still wearing manchu clothes and wearing trees word  you know when i called the operator one which state in singapore number two okay do they speak english back there i mean it was like ah god it's amazing how uhm we know so much about them and how little they know about us you see ya it's cultural domination you know and they think it's not important because we're just one little island back in the east they don't even know we're an island they don't know they don't even know not many people down there over there uh know what singapore where singapore is oh ya i know every time i say where singapore is i usually appendage it with one degree from the equator not in china miles from it and and then i confuse them with the straits chinese description uhm and and i had these people it's really quite amazing and and and it's like but the poor people at night word  i mean some of them i was called the fucking hit in uhm in those island what ya i guess it's all part of the la island experience i got up the boat i was on my way down and that this carrot-coloured punk uh uhm uh uh just started muttering hey hey fucking hit fascist racist you know ya man probably got style on his cheek but that was the only experience i had with racism that's why from the harvard experience which you probably know of did i tell you about that ya what the harvard experience who was that in boston i didn't tell you about that it was probably vivienne i told then it was really quite bizarre i want to take a picture of the reading room and compare it with the situation here uh uhm then and apparently oh ya ya i've taken a picture of this old man who was sitting there and studying you should have asked permission uh well actually i didn't intend to take a picture of him oh he was just part of the background foreground actually so what happened was uh five minutes later he charged down the stairways and grabbed the camera just out of my hand like that i was just talking to my friend i was holding the camera he just pulled it out and all that what the hell and he then he started to fiddle with it and everything my god he's sick he didn't even explain or anything and i said we shouldn't have taken a picture we shouldn't have taken a picture and i was thinking of uhm t s elliot's word woman and he was like he started fiddling but it was a manual thing so he couldn't fiddle anything with it so friends of mine were there and they grabbed hold of him and then a tussle followed then the police were brought in and then then you know removed the rascal and oh god hey boy was it management came and then are you okay were you alright and then uhm of course as his parting shot uhm he looked at all four us two south africans one dutch and one oriental he said get the hell back wherever you came from and if you published any of that i'll i'll make sure you're sorry for it or something yeah but it was great i mean he was he was kind of a good-looking man too i mean it's like you know he's very well-trimmed white beard and wearing beige-coloured shirt bizarre now how am i going to incorporate all of that into a story you try you try ya smart girl like you yes uh uh do i detect words word of condescend don't disappoint us naw naw lah well should i be i believe in letting people have the freedom to do to write what they want to write oh yeah ya so i i try not to circumscribe lah otherwise it'll be too much i'm going to write something too don't know how to write as i know so much i think everybody word too much ya if you know too much about something it's very difficult to focus or you can write about racism uhm ya ya you can write about racism i've got a couple of newspapers with uhm those journalists chinese journalist who's working at san fran uh uhm in san francisco or something and uh she was writing about the la riots her experiences with word  uh uhm what you say is true you know there's this black woman who said word down  word everywhere no matter how high you climb there's always going to be one above you uhm  word  maybe there's why so many people come back here ya  that's one of the advantages i love the openness uh uhm you come back here the atmosphere everything is so stifling in a way uh uhm but then again it could be imaginary ya it's different also i mean it's like i think it depends on who you hang out with also it depends on who you you talk you meet the kind of people here i mean uhm i'm quite happy here that's good that's good i am happy here if i have my way but then i haven't been away a lot you see for people who did like studying in england i have friends who have to come back from england they're not happy here because all their formative years were there uh you know poor thing in the university and then they come back and you know  word  and they're rotting away here uhm i always told myself that these things were imaginary and i and i've been abroad i find myself defending my own country and when i came back here it's like came back to hey this place is stifling and boring and ai the same vicious circle the grass is always greener but then there are a lot of things here anyway i believe that really things that are closed up you see closed up it's ugly you see you think it's beautiful you see from afar but when you look at it closed up it looks quite ugly then you have to word get beyond that point and look at look at it closed up you find the beauty you see but it's the same whether you're here whether you're there it's the same thing perceptions don't change it's word attitude doesn't change but there are things here that keep on surprising me all the time there's always something that's word all the time so i like that's why i'm quite happy but there are people here who are i mean it's not a complete desert you see there are people here who are worth it you know ya there are but it's i don't know maybe it's because i've always been too insular and i don't really have that many friends around me usually i tend to mix around stagnate in the same pool uhm no you don't stagnate okay to use alvin's term you get deeper you get deeper you don't stagnate okay must must have description also yes okay you go down deeper then you surface again and then you can like take a view you know and you have a take a ah  word  ya it's a it's a spiral movement ya you go down again you surface again uhm and you look around you
