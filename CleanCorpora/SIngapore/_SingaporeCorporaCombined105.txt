right uhm before we start the usual things again the assessment forms please fill it in and uh pass it to your class reps who will give it to the g.o. okay my code instructor code 2180 64 now we are going to do letters of credit today but before we move on to that i want to just uhm summarise some points about the mortgages like our tutorial we had this is to uh enable some of you who were not quite finished the last time to word take note and then we can go on to letters of credit so this part won't be too much of a discussion hope you don't mind about that the mortgages tutorial question three was essentially a tutorial on land titles mortgages okay and before i go on to that actually there's a point on question two which i want to uh mention which i missed the last time and this is in relation to two b where the mortgage jobs lease have been terminated by his lessor okay we mention that his primary remedy would be a covenant i mean a suit upon the personal covenant uh under section eighteen of the clpa there is also provision for the mortgagee to go to court and apply for what is called a relief okay from from a relief in uh in other words asking the court to say look i've got interests this guy can move in but surely he's got to think about me could you ask him to give me some money at least you know that sort of thing so an application for relief section eighteen clpa okay so now question three the same sets of facts but uhm two a which say that as far as that is concerned uhm the pla has got uh provision for entry possession the difference between lpa entry and clpa entry is that under the lpa the mortgagee has got to give notice the one month notice before he moves in and his notice is given only if there is default okay if you remember under common law the mortgagee's right to enter is at any time even before the ink is dry on the deed but in this case in the lta your entry must be upon default since there is default here that point is academic that's three a three b i mention that uh once you look at the register the register is everything so if you see a mortgage there the lessor would have to take subject to the mortgagee's interest that's quite obvious because everything is on the register he would have noticed even if he didn't read it actually he's got constructive notice that there is a prior party so that he when he forfeits the lease of the lessee he takes that land back for himself that is he must take it subject to the mortgagee's interest okay and we've got that as a basic principle and it's supported of course by the lta the lta has got section sixty-two which says that when the lessor and the lessee's interests are merged in this case it has become uh merged in one person's name then what happen is that lessor that person who took the merged interest would have to pay off the mortgagee section sixty-two lta and furthermore we find that there is a section fifty-nine sub-section sub-section one of the lta again which states that a transferee cough  excuse me a transferee must uhm either pay off the mortgagee that means discharge him or perform the obligations of the mortgage so in this case section fifty-nine one is also useful for the mortgaging so you find that for under the lta the mortgager's position is much happier is not so long of course as he's registered okay regis the regis the register is everything therefore the mortgagee must register most cases you find they do once it's registered his rights are there in the lta section fifty-nine one question sixty-two okay three b three c is an oral contract which means it's an equitable mortgage under the lta you can have equitable mortgages it is recognised implicitly in section thirty-seven two which says that once you have contractual rights the lta does not invalidate those contractual rights it is also expressly accepted in a case decided by our former chief justice the case called bank of china uh bank of china versus official assignee nineteen eighty three case bank of china's case now we know generally that the remedies of the lta mortgagee are the same as he has been common law the section sixty-four lta says so section lt four uh section sixty-four basically says that the clpa and all your common law rights apply mutatis mutandis okay i explain because it's got something it's got nothing to do with the ninja turtles but nonetheless the root word is the same mutations so uh mu mutatis mutandis section sixty-four says that the clpa applies with appropriate changes in other words okay the appropriate changes meaning for example when the clpa talks about say a free-hold owner you just change it to registered proprietor terminology of the lta uh when the clpa says you've got a right for closure you look at the lta you find that the uh those rights mentioned in clpa are slightly modified in section seventy seven zero of the lta okay so mutatis mutandis so in this case then if the lta recogises an equitable mortgage then obviously what you have in common law the equitable mortgagee's rights those are more or less similar in the lta's system three d there is no mention anywhere at the and the lta that the rules about fixtures have been abolished so you can say that in this sense the lta is silent about fixtures therefore common law applies you could also actually look at section four definition of land section four lta defines land to include uhm structures affixed thereon for example and i think you could read that to mean that the law of fixtures mean the same okay that's three d and therefore the answer should be the same as in two d three e when we talk about relevant word of course we're talking about the lta the mortgage has not been registered under the lta which means it is not valid it is not recognised by the lta as a legal mortgage since it's not registered and since the register is everything this is not a valid legal legal mortgage nonetheless the lta does recognise an equitable mortgage as we said earlier that equitable mortgage cannot be registered but you can lodge a caveat in respect of that interest the purpose of lodging a caveat is basically to warn okay caveat means warning to warn the whole world at large that okay i don't have a registered interest but you better transact with my interest in mind i am an equitable mortgagee i may not have very strong rights but you must remember me when you talk to the registered proprietor so this is different from the roda roda basically as i said earlier on registration does not affect validity if you're already valid under the common law you remain valid even if you don't register if you originally were invalid registration does not make you valid so the roda does not affect validity but if you were a valid legal mortgage and you are number one in the queue you do want to continue being number one and in this case therefore you want to register because if you don't register you're going you're going to lose out you're going to lose your place in the queue and there's no point saying i've got a legal mortgage it is valid therefore i have a power of sale but you're number ten by the time you come to exercise the power of sale there's nothing to sell right so you want to be first in line you register  word being a legal mortgage ah doesn't it rank you ahead of the rest already yes no because if you don't register you don't have priorities so the fact that you are legal mortgage doesn't matter now because the roda changes your rights of priority section four basically and section fourteen of the roda okay section section four says you must register section fourteen says once you register you are preserving your priority consequently if you don't register you don't preserve your priority sir then when will it go when the equi the legal mor mortgage was prevailed when okay that was all the all the rules about legal over equitable and all that apply when there is no statutory amendment so for fixed charges and closing charges when they talk about ranking of course the legal prevails and the fixed prevails again they you talk about priority in other areas of property law which hasn't been changed the statute the ranking is there it's it's a general framework of law the ranking is given by common law but common common law can be prevailed can be overruled by statute and in land it has been overruled by the roda and by the lta okay so remember those rules i taught you earlier as a sort of background or a base on which now you are building new knowledge and that's the roda and the lta okay right now in this case registration uh non registration rather non registration would make the mortgage invalid unless it can be construed as an equitable mortgage in which case it's got the right of an equitable mortgagee i mean the the the mortgagee will have the right to the equitable mortgagee and that's another different story the whole idea of the lta is that once you've got registered land you don't have to look anywhere to search for title to search for who is the owner who has got a charge who's got a mortgage who's got a pledge whatever everything is on the register and that simple statement every the register is everything comes from privy council case actually and you could remember that as a quotable quote the register is everything exception of course is actual fraud when you have actual fraud then the person who's been defrauded can go to court and upset or erase the registration so to speak okay rectify the register okay that's two e and therefore two f is basically the same answer the unregistered mortgage it doesn't matter whether you are legal or equitable in this case once you're unregistered you do not have priority of course the registered legal mortgage will take priority one small little refinement to this point if the unregistered mortgage is an equitable mortgage you can't you can't register it at all under lta and since you can't register it there is no fight because here we've got a interest that is unregisterable versus an interest which is registerable and between these two then the the ah equitable mortgagee must lodge a caveat to preserve his priority if he doesn't lodge a caveat i would think he remains outside the register and therefore he has no right at all now in this case you would want to note the difference between the roda system and the lta remember i said that under the roda whether you are equitable or you're legal you are both registerable you are both registered registerable under the roda and therefore you've you have competing interests if one doesn't register in the lta system only legal mortgages can be registered and the equitable mortgage if you want to preserve your prio priority you have to caveat your interest okay and that sums up everything you need to know about lta questions sir when you lodge a caveat right does he rank uh ahead of the legal mortgage  well the caveat is a sort of notice to the world re remember if you remember your fixed charge lectures your first charge is a floating charge a second charge comes along and it's a fixed charge now the fixed charge prevails over the floating charge you jump the queue if you're a fixed charge but if you are a fixed charge with notice of a negative pledge cross up here then you take with notice and therefore you take subject to that floating charge interest right same thing here you've got an equitable mortgage caveated notice to all subsequent people that i've got an equitable mortgage then a legal legal mortgage comes along it's registered but it's registered subject to that interest because there is notice either actual or constructive okay right further questions okay no further questions we move on to our letters of credit and firts question you are now employed by this bank very progressive bank it wants to entertain the customers' wish if you can solve the problems that the requests ah raise so now we want to discuss these problems and see whether it can accede to the customers' requests okay so mr big your customer first request electronic communication facilities for credit can you accede to that request would you are there any problems mr big just wants communication facilites to apply for credits to notify his beneficiary to notify himself that his credit has been opened basically that can you do it yes no yes or no s2: yes yes who says no anyone thinks you won't request uh you won't accede to the request so you think yes all of you think yes are there no problems then what problems do you think there might be in this case any problem okay the technical problems we're not going to discuss them here but anyway this is not a problem because technology exists to allow the customer to communicate with this bank by electronic communications right so it exists the modem is quite cheap the telephone is quite cheap your fax machine all these things are on fact quite common so it's not the question of technology is there a legal problem is there a legal problem here what sort what sort of problem do you have here if you think there is a problem anyone
