on am singapore we'll be exploring the approach to this year's speak mandarin campaign five ways to save the environment and a french minister's view on trade and tariffs good morning i'm elynur nair but first patriotic missiles have been deployed to saudi arabia from the united states along with one thousand three hundred soldiers trained to use them this comes at a time when tension is high in the region where iraq continues to detain the un team hunting for evidence of its nuclear programs so far only two of the us-gulf war allies have responded to the situation the british and israeli prime ministers have both called for the destruction of iraq's nuclear capabilities other allies especially the middle-easterns are keeping quiet on this issue to find out why christina eng calls dr paul rogers of bradford univerisity earlier this morning  pr  but by keeping quiet can they defuse the tension it doesn't help any does it  pr  well saudi arabia is getting ready for a major crisis by accepting the patriot missiles at this time does this mean that uhm it is taking sides with the us  pr  well if them no eastern allies don't want to take sides can they be relied on to rally around the us once again should force be decided on by the security council  pr  that was dr paul rogers on support for the us from its allies the time now is nineteen minutes past seven and next we look at news occurring on the home front speak mandarin in mandarin well it's that time of the year again to brush up on your mandarin that is if you're a chinese singaporean and haven't been speaking mandarin for the twelve years the campaign's been on if you're one of them the organisers hope that this time round chinese mythological figures a lighthearted approach and even some humour will convince you to speak more mandarin and through it better appreciate chinese culture for the theme this year is that mandarin is more than just a language this is a change from last year's slogan if you're a chinese make a statement in mandarin that raised quite a few eyebrows with that in mind how careful have the organisers been to avoid another issue deputy director of publicity and promotions at the ministry of information and the arts henry ng explains  word in this year we're taking a different approach the approach we take is a light-hearted approach it won't be offending anybody we want to appeal to people's urge to learn the chinese culture and chinese heritage through the use of mandarin that means if you know mandarin you speak mandarin you appreciate chinese culture better have you taken soundings from the other committees to see if the they feel that this year's slogan is perhaps uhm as sensitive as last year's i think uh in the committee to promote the use of mandarin we have uh members who are english educated their views have been sought and they have given an input uh in coming out with this slogan so i think that this year's slogan won't be as controversial as the past year where have you consulted uhm members from the other committees i think we do uh we have consulted uh other mps uh and also through the mps to tell uh community so i am confident that this year's slogan should be acceptable to all this year's campaign like that of the past couple of years has tended to equate the learning of mandarin with the learning of chinese culture uh it there a danger over the years that the mandarin campaign has lost its initial objective of replacing dialects instead of replacing english i think our basic aim is still the same uh we try to get people to speak more mandarin instead of dialects then how do you explain some of the activities during the campaign like encouraging government office to speak uh mandarin to chinese singaporeans regardless of whether they uh whether they can speak english or not as the the survey uh reveals we have more and more chinese singaporeans speaking uh man mandarin in fact even though the chinese singaporeans may not uh completely speak fluent mandarin but they'll understand it and uh they can speak some of it but only that uh they may not feel too comfortable in doing so uh again i'm not uh saying that we are trying to replace english with mandarin but if they are already familiar with the language and they know a little bit of it then if they practice more they will speak better that is the idea the prime minister said last week that the government will begin to pay more attention to the chinese educated segments of society uhm has this new policy affected the way in which this campaign will be carried perhaps with more intensity i think the budget uh of the campaign is fixed we have people uh sponsor activities during the campaign month but all in all we won't be able to uh spend too much uh on media because campaign budget is fixed that was henry ng of mita talking to adrian ong about this year's speak mandarin campaign that'll be launched this coming monday night ambassador-at-large professor tommy koh has said that singapore will continue to rely on oil and gas until further energy becomes commercially attractive addressing the seventh asia-pacific petroleum conference yesterday he gave five suggestions whereby singapore can use energy more efficiently and thus help the environment professor koh who's also chairman of the preparatory committee of the united nations conference on environment and development told jane ong what his five ideas are first i will like to see the ministry of the environment working together with the national council on the environment and the consumers uh uh association to promote green consumerism what i mean is to educate the public so that the public will behave in a more environmentally responsible way such as switching from ordinary light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs and uh buying fuel efficient cars fuel efficient refrigerators air-conditioners uh second i will like to see our architects design buildings which are more suited to our climate you know buildings which are not intended for air-conditioning should have more shade and cross ventilation then third i will like to see uh the air-conditioning engineers do a better job than they do now at the moment many of our indoor spaces are over-conditioned uh the other thing i want to suggest is that uh the pub should see how it can increase the thermal efficiency at their power plants which at the moment is about 40 per cent which means that 60 per cent of the heat generated has been lost finally i would uh like to commend the government for making provisions in its concept plan for bike way but i want on behalf of the cyclists in singapore to make the point that at the moment our streets are unsafe for cycling and i think there is no better way of transport than uh the bicycle because it's a non-polluting uh vehicle how do you think we can actually put pressure on uhm the concerned for these and parties for example the cyclists' pathways and in encouraging people to rely less on air-conditioning how do you think we can actually move these things on a much faster pace well the ministry of the environment is intending in fact to uh initiate the campaign on green consumerism uh and i think that the non-governmental organisations you know like uh the nature society the national council of the environment uh the ministry education uh our junior colleges or schools i think that and and and an environmentally jour journalist you know that was recently uh formed uh a forum of uh environmental journalists in singapore i think that these people should come together to educate the public i i don't think you know it is helpful in singapore to take a confrontational attitude towards government and if it's unnecessary anyway because the ministry of the environment is in fact taking the lead in many fields you know so i think what we need to do is work together with the ministry of the environment the ministry education on an industrial level how do you think environmentalists or an environment concerned people in singapore can work with the oil industry for example which is so important here to ensure that uhm we have a safe a good clean environment i think that the national council of the environment uh should and the nature's society should have a dialogue with the leaders of our oil industry uh and uh i would myself like to promote such a dialogue are you happy with what the oil industry has been now uh i think the leadership of the major oil in uh companies we have are in fact uh very responsive to the environmental concern so i would say yes professor tommy koh on saving energy and saving the environment the french minister of trade for foreign affairs mr word  said that france is committed to the success of talks under the general agreement on trade and tariffs along with the other members of the european community france has has been accused of snagging the five year word round of great gatt talks they've been criticised for refusing to cut back on subsidies to its farmers with gatt talks resuming next month many of its members are not optimistic that a conclusion would be reached before the end of the year jane ong asked mr who was here for a two-day visit if he holds the same view so will france's conviction for this uhm talks to be successfully concluded will that conviction include even giving in on the issue of the farm subsidies which has been described as the stumbling block so far and that was mr the french minister of trade for foreign affairs who left singapore for paris last night and coming up next on am singapore making a phone call from the air singapore airlines passenger will no longer have to wait before landing to make a phone call sia has just launched a new air to ground phone service called cetestial that can be used by its long-distance passengers we join shangi barachargi on her first attempt at making the celestial phone call hello i'm shangi barachargi i'm calling you from thirty-five thousand feet above south china sea through celestial sia's new service for its passengers able to reach anywhere in the world the service will be available on all sia's long-distance flights by 1994 now sitting next to me is sia's marketing uh director of marketing services mr joseph chew good morning mr chew now mr chew celestial looks like a rather ordinary cordless telephone but how does the system actually work well the celestial is the high phone service from sia and it works quite simply via satellite you make a call from the cabin word via the satellite through to the ground telecommunicative system through three outstations like word in the uk word  in norway and sentosa in singapore now this phone call is costing us about 15 singapore dollars for every minute even this rate's rather steep for the average uhm passenger well we have looked into this cost but really the element of cost uh does not arise because this is a service that we are providing to passengers uh and we believe that this is an integral part of service that we want to extend to enhance our service how many people do you see using this service and who will they be we do not know exactly how many passengers would like to use it but we figure it would be very popular among the business people business travellers and even the family man who's travelling on board  now only a fifteen singapore dollars is rather steep is there a possibility of introducing an off-peak pricing system at the moment we're not sure whether there will be an off-peak uh rate uh all we can say is that the rate is calculated word a very nominal basis now uh i understand that this is a first of sia's uhm new services to to developing a total visit centre for its passengers now the other thing is back and the date transition centres when do you see this coming on line well celestial is the first uh first at stage next we believe we will introduce the fax services and real time uh news financial services and health services probably in two within two years uh it seems that we're running out of time at the moment so we have to end the interview there thank you very much mr chew for your company and so with that i'm here on sq 888 with elnor nair and chirstina eng back in the studio and that was with how you could sound like at thirty nine thousand feet in the clouds well with that it's time to come down to earth i'm alna nair with producer christian eng and we'll be back again tomorrow with am singapore if you happen to be at one of those flights at seven fifteen am why not give us a call at 3503676 that's 3503676
