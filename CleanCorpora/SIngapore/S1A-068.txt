come back you see
""
then all of a sudden i have four deadlines all clashing
""
""

communications

you know communications it is a it's it's like two disciplines
lah inter-disciplinary so you do international relations combine with
""

""
""
not so bad
""
""
this is my ticket stub
""
""
so are you on the field or are you up there
""
""

""
""

dollars also
""
""
ha
""
""
why don't you sit opposite the grand stand
""
it's always
""
""
that is where were sitting
""
ya we did
""
""
the view was pretty good
""
""
is it
""
you sat opposite the grand stand
""
""
ya on the other side lah michael jackson was about this big
""
""
is it
""
""
ya can still see him we can still see him
""
""
but i go in and then i see all these people who look like
ants
""
they're so small on the gallery you know what i mean and then
""
""
aye can you imagine i manage to find them
""
""
don't you think that she is very lucky you know
""
""
ya she can say go there and meet and then thousands of people
are there and she manages to find them
""
crazy
""
""
how did you do it
""
""
got fed up i sat down then i saw my friends walking by
""
fortunately they were going to the toilet so it was a good thing
""
""
how are you feeling today
""
""
i think better lah
""
i i
""
""
aiyah but will this go in or not
""
""
so you did manage to talk to the man lah
""
""
ya i went to talk to the man
""
""
and he was positive about it
""
""
ya he was positive
""
""
good
""
""
he did say what to do if she doesn't want to supervise
""
do another topic
""
he was very nonchalant lah so all the better lah it's not
according to him
""
ya i said if you want to leave leave in a state of grace compose
your you know compose yourself and leave
""
i mean no lah shop for another topic another supervisor
""
""
you must change topic ah
""
""
ask him to stop talking to elliot
""
""
ha i think i would i would
""
""
you should have been with us yesterday
""
we ate so much know and then
""
""
i hate michael jackson
""
""
didn't he come out and sing at all
""
""
he didn't
""
""
he didn't
""
""
i thought he came out and perform then he fainted
""
""
no nonsense
""
""
he fainted even before the concert so flop
""
""
he fainted meh
""
""
he fainted
""
""
really
""
""
ya
""
""
why
""
""
due to migraine
""
""
he is so weak he probably
""
""
thai weather so hot lah
""
""
singapore weather too hot for him
""
""
no he probably didn't bring forgot to bring his oxygen
chamber along that's why he fainted
""
""
and people come from johore and there was this girl who
suddenly  word 
""
too bad lah
""
she came all the way from johore okay
""
""
to watch
""
""
some even flew in from jarkarta
""
""
from like from penang
""
""
i think he is so bloody inconsiderate
""
serious you know he is the most inconsiderate superstar
""
""
ya my mum said she he played everyone out now thousands of
people out
""
i said ya if you are famous enough you get
""
""
so is your mum gonna go with you on wednesday if it does
happen
""
""
i don't think so honestly if you were at the performance
yesterday
""
""
but at least you have fixed seats
""
not so bad you didn't go like how many hours
""
""
can imagine we have people who line up in the morning and
then when cancel oh boy
""
if i had to line up oh please
""
""
what will happen
""
""
moral of the story don't always go for the first concerts
""
usually don't mess up so much then
""
""
how about the bangkok one
""
""
they cancelled the second one
""
they cancelled the second the subsequent ones
""
""
who wants to insure michael jackson then
""
everybody is so frighten of insuring his concerts then
""
isn't it
""
""
ya i mean who wants to go now
""
""
people will still go
""
""
i mean we should all boycott
""
""
ya to start a movement or something
""
""
ya
""
""
boycott michael jackson
""
""
and this is not his first time
""
he has been cancelling it in europe and japan and so on
""
""
but some people are very against it
""
""
but why
""
""
what if somebody else do it
""
""
no more sales
""
""
no but then isn't he's risking his reputation
""
""
he doesn't care
""
he has really enough money to live so why does care
""
""
but i think these are just to boost uh cds sales or something
""
""
ya it's all publicity stunts
""
""
so it's not a money-making thing that he's out here for the
concert
""
""
i don't think he makes very much out of concerts
""
""
it's sponsored by pepsi why not
""
pepsi's paying
""
""
still doesn't affect him what and then if he cancels out
because ultimately they  word  it they don't have to like
pay compensation you know
""
they just have to re refund
""
""
because there is always you know insure uh guys ah who insure
the whole concert for don't know what what what
""
""
but i don't think they'll
""
i think they'll only like uhm pay the organisers or something
""
i don't think concerts goers like if you ask for a refund they
will just give you the basic your basic refund
""
not a not compensation right
""
they don't lose out
