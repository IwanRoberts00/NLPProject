house uh
""
they went through quite a trying tiring time doing that so they
have a lot rich experience to share
""
""
oh yes definitely
""
""
like where to put the plugs which position when to start uh
thinking of where you want to put all these stuff where the wiring will be
you know little things like where the door bell is gonna be stuff like that
that you never think about
""
""
small little things which had a lot effect
""
""
and how and how to get maximum mileage from a irresponsible
contractor
""
""
oh yes

""
oh i see i see
""
""

""
""
so they are they are they're in their final process of getting
their house ready lah basically
""
""
it is almost ready
""
""
it is fantastic you know
""
""
that is if you know the lighting and everything
""
""
ya ya it is very
""
""
and the sofa it doesn't look out of place what
""
""
ya it doesn't look green at all you know
""
""
fits very well fits very very well  research assistant's
voice 
""
""
just found your place
""
""
we found a small kabi hole somewhere at yishun
""
""
ya
""
""
so
""
""
everybody thinks it is too way out
""
""
ya
""
""
ya
""
""
it is it is it's a it's a it is a cosy little place lah
""
i mean you roll around you basically can reach one end of the
skirting in the other
""
""
with one roll one more to the other room
""
""
so so it is quite it is quite a good place
""
uh uh we are learning as we as we say lah learning a lot of things
from peng seng and sally on how to set up the place how to
""
""
to start with i think it is good to have a small home
""
""
correct they may want to
""
""
comfortable small home you know don't don't go for too big a
home
""
""
it is good
""
we can't afford anyway
""
""
ya
""
""
you just get something you know which both of you are
comfortable with you know happy that is the most important
""
don't have to  word 
""
""
she is uh uh she is one of our sources of inspiration because
there were a lot of forces against us
""
what so small you know like a pig sty that is like oh we had felt
really moody but my sister was one of those lah who agrees because she went
through it you see
""
she had a small house and she first met him and got married
""
""
ya first home was about that small
""
""
so first home was only one uh
""
""
one bedroom
""
""
one bedroom and one hall
""
""
one living one dining one small little kitchenette
""
""
yes
""
""
actually actually for this kind of project it is very
important for the family to rally around 'cause you are you are really going
into the an unknown you see
""
i mean you are doing this for the first time it is good to get
support
""
""
no you need support yes
""
""
our family never gave
""
""
moral support encouragement
""
""
really know getting it
""
it's like when somebody buys a house you will be happy right
""
we were so sad you know we were so moody for the first weeks you
know
""
""
ya ya ya ya
""
""
until we finally sink sank into the idea and got used to it
you know and we get more and more confident and we went to visit
""
we walked from the house till the m r t station
""
it took only about less than ten minutes
""
that really boosted our confidence
""
it's like wow this is a great place and then after that we visited
north point and there was such a nice cinema
""
ya ya we would even used you honey  word  you
look so
""
""
wait till nicodemus grows up
""
""
nephew six months old
""
""
fantastic little kid
""
""
chubby
""
""
hello there
""
""
wearing his rugby t-shirt
""
""
ya ya so that was hilary  word 
""
but now we are quite happy
""
""
now our model house is actually uh sally and peng seng's
house
""
they have already set up they have gone through everything
""
""
our house would be their storage house too
""
""
from now from now
""
""
ya
""
""
from now from now
""
""
ya
""
""
so they are charging us standard ware housing rates uhm for
""
""
ya ya ya have that recorded too
""
""
like a a french a dinner every month
""
""
every quarter
""
""
monthly
""
""
hey hey you know what i found out
""
""
there was
""
""
that right after we had dinner that weekend the next weekend
there were french dinners you know buffet you know elsewhere so upset
""
""
where is that
""
""
pan pacific
""
""
one is pan pacific the other one was
""
""
maybe it is weekdays again is it
""
""
i don't know i don't think so  word  and
it is really i think ko yak one
""
""
i mean the spread at pan pacific was anyway in fact so
""
""
ya i never go hilton again
""
i think it is too backward still in the colonial thinking
""
""
so you all are all set for your wedding
""
""
no lah
""
""
actually not
""
""
not set
""
""
still got
""
""
got a lot of uh uh differences to iron out
""
""
like what
""
""
differences in our opinion
""
""
for example
""
""
operating styles
""
""
in operating style more like it in a depth of uh uh memory
""
""
rather lack of
""
""
depth of lack of what is
""
""
she pointed to herself when she said
""
""
depth
""
""
depth of and pointed to me when she said lack of
""
for record purposes okay
""
nicodemus hello there
""
""
you must enjoy yourself while you prepare
""
""
ya ya
""
""
for your wedding
""
really it is a life long
""
""
actually where were
""
""
don't make it a chore
""
""
ya ya don't make it a chore
""
this is a once in a life time you won't have to go through this
another time you see and because the wedding itself
""
""
ya ya you you usually won't want to
""
and the wedding itself is only one day and it just passed by in
the snap of the eye
""
""
so quickly
""
""
ya it is so fast you know
""
""
but going on still got preparation and all that and in the
end when you do it uh uh it looks doesn't it feel so official right or not
""
they are not maybe not for yourself but i mean the logistics you
have to worry about this worry about that
""
in the end when you have it it is just like you are having a show
you know
""
""
ya ya i know
""
""
then that is it is finished
""
full stop that is it
""
""
ya ya i think sometimes when you are so much like planning
you got so many things to do in the end it is like like putting up a show
""
""
ya
""
""
part of it is for yourself part of it is for your friends and
and
""
""
ya for family
""
""
a big part is for your family
""
""
ya
""
""
not everything is for yourself
""
""
ya
""
""
you know like that malay i was talking to my malay colleagues
the concept you know it is that you leave everything to your family members
""
they will plan the you know they plan the singing sessions
""
they will plan the food you know
""
they will invite friends and then everyone just comes along and
sit down have a good time
""
i mean their concept is disappeared from our chinese uh dictionary
gone
""
""
maybe it is become too organised
""
""
ya lah too too much of a show already road show
""
""
it is no longer for the wedding couple anymore
""
""
ya
""
""
it is more for everybody else and you have to do so many
things you know just for everybody
""
""
did you guys attend a ceremony
""
""
it is very tiring
""
""
in the states ah
""
""
what they in the states they have a ceremony and then they
come home and then in their backyard they have a barbeque or whatever
""
""
oh ya we had one
""
we attended
""
""
ya we attended one once only
""
""
is that what they do
""
""
yes uh
""
""
that was uh
""
""
know this guy
""
""
it was very casual
""
""
he is a bit weird
""
he has already got kids
""
""
they had a re uh
""
""
remarriage
""
""
reconfirmation of their marriage
""
they were already married
""
""
and their daughters were their flower girls
""
their sons were their page boy
""
""
but they were married already legally married
""
""
they were legally married
""
""
so they wanted to have a
""
""
church wedding
""
""
church wed
""
they didn't have a
""
""
what you call it rededication or something
""
""
church wedding
""
they didn't have a celebration when they were younger you see when
they first got married
""
so now that
""
""
it was about twenty years ago
""
""
everything all settled and they have all their friends all
you know social life all established
""
they decided that they need a reconfirmation of their
""
""
so funny ya
""
""
not rededication
""
""
but my friend told me that uh suet yee was telling me in uk
it's very simple one you know
""
she said her friend borrowed somebody's dress somebody's wedding
gown
""
i mean may not even wedding gown
""
it's just a nice dress you know and then they got married
""
after the church they they just went off
""
nothing no buffet nothing you know ya
""
it's very easy you know
""
it's just a church wedding
""
so simple and then i am saying it saves so much money you know
""
i was like
""
""
no i think i think it depends on the individuals uh you know
perception of or what you want a wedding to be
