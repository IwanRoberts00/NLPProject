now ah actually i feel very sian uh ya actually it it's quite different from what i felt last week when i finish gnn word and i i look forward for this trip to start anew now quite sian ya i think i feel quite sian that's why when i was telling my friend also i said i told you i feel very sian then she just said why the worst thing is i've been for or word  ya i think it's worse for you and just now they were talking about canada it's in summer the weather is very cool i said aiyah and i am not going there ya hor i know what you mean never mind people always ask me how did your boss allocate people like those who have been before also go again kind of strange i don't know because i am doing exactly the same thing as kong weng detention demurrage and cost so is either he is here or i'm there doing but he's less experienced lah in terms of no lah i think we learn cost at the same time because german trident was my first agent audit also before that i keep doing those other companies you know like forwardees forwarders different from weng choo's but actually boss didn't allocate the sections you do what he just allocate the job only no he did allocate like roughly this person will do cost or revenue i think just basic things cost revenue financial like that these three areas alright i think so from what he said lah i just very i think people affect me a lot do they affect you a lot i mean people's behaviour did you if they are very jovial i will feel very happy then i think i would work faster hor don't know lah i think it depends a lot on me also not so much of the surrounding so got to cheer up hor ya okay so i think we can we can a difference all right doesn't that reminds me of somebody aye we can go to a christian bookshop cheap ah it's very big you know three stories that's good ah anyway what's the name can't remember nearby i i can remember how to go i think i can ask the girl the christian girl i think we should look forward to it ya lor we try to
