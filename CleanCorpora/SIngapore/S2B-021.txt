""
the japanese then the french and afterwards with the cambodians
and the chinese and of course among themselves
""
in fact this is the first year of peace in vietnam for almost half a
century
""
when you're so used to war peace can be strange and it's stranger
still when you stop to think about what vietnam is really doing today
""
after half a century of fighting and getting rid of foreigners
vietnam is now asking them back to help it win the peace
""
unlike before there are now frequent international flights to hanoi
""
but before you set foot in vietnam it's easy to put labels on the
country
""
we think of vietnamese as aggressive people
""
hanoi a heart of hard line marxism and the place so oppressive that
people had to flee in boats
""
but the capital is not like that at all
""
there may not be many cars but almost everyone owns a bicycle and
like many cities there are people and people
""
hard to believe that this is the country of war for decades from
which the boat people fled in such terror
""
today the vietnamese are evidently at ease with each other and
strangers too
""
especially strangers who carry us dollars
""
we're told that vietnamese are proud people but pride evidently has
to take a back seat when the local currency the dong is practically worthless
""
if you buy anything in dong you need a brief case for the notes and
for anything expensive this counting machine comes in handy
""
everyone wants us dollars an irony that leaves the visitor
wondering how complete vietnam's victory over the us was
""
and for most vietnamese ho chi min is still the man who liberated
the country from american imperialism
""
yet the present leaders are ready to invite the americans back and
end the trade embargo impose since the end of the vietnam war in 1975
""
but the apparent inconsistency stops here
""
when you're finally settle down talk and work with the vietnamese
you'd realise how simple and practical their approach is
""
there is none of the psychoanalysis or the academy award winning
movies of war
""
at least not yet
""
more vietnamese die in the war than all the foreigners combined and
the wars were fought on their soil
""
the warning of the dead continues
""
with the help of an interpreter we visited the home of a tailor
""
do ding fong has been sewing since he was sixteen
""
today at sixty he leaves most of it to his son giving him more time
with his one hundred year old mother
""
tailoring brings in about four hundred and fifty thousand dong a
month which is only about forty us dollars
""
it's difficult to get by especially when he has in-laws staying
with him
""
there is at least enough rice to prepare for everyone
""
his mother receives twenty-five kilos of rice a month from the
government
""
she has lived through all the wars and her son ding fong's brother
was killed in dian bian fu
""
another family and the same philosophical attitude
""
singapore's senior minister visited vietnam last month
""
the way the vietnamese show their grief he feels has a lot to do
with their culture
""
travelling down from hanoi to the south and you get the distinct
feeling that you're entering modern vietnam
""
everyone tells you how fast ho chi min city is developing into a
business centre the signs that greet you when you arrive confirm it
""
there is indeed an unrelenting celebration of private enterprise
here
""
and why not
""
after all this was saigon where people were businessmen by instinct
""
despite the name change there is still plenty of evidence of the
old saigon
""
many still call the city by its old name
""
vietnam today is a wash with the mood of doi moi or renovation
their version of perestroika
""
the call for reform in the economy started back in the early
eighties although the real turning point came in 1986 when vietnam swung its
door open to foreigners
""
today economy liberalisation is not only encouraged it is also
ideologically correct
""
 word  is an advisor to the present government
""
a harvard economist he was acting prime minister of south vietnam
between 1965 to 66 vietnam he feels is in a state of transition
""
but what the politician wants to do sounds good
""
but what vietnam is remains very far from what its leaders want it
to be
""
these veterans fought for their country in the name of communism
and nationalism and what's more they won
""
but the country has made a mess of the peace that followed
""
vietnam is easily one of the poorest countries in the world today
by every measure from clean water to sewerage to electricity vietnam has been
sinking while the rest of asia has bloomed
""
the great majority of the population live in acute poverty
ill-housed undernourished and underemployed
""
the shock of the transition from communism to capitalism
exacerbated the miseries of the old order
""
the population is now approaching seventy million people
""
more than twenty per cent are without full-time employment
""
for some of them scavenging on the margins of the market fills the
vital gap between hunger and starvation
""
lenin lingers in vietnam as a forlorn reminder of what went wrong
""
in fact it is an irony that this statue still stands while the one
in lenin was destroyed when the soviet union self-destructed
""
the disappearance of the soviet union and the eastern block
countries had been hard on vietnam whose economy had relied heavily on soviet
aid
""
today with no aid and no communist markets for vietnamese exports
what is left is a heavy and unwanted soviet legacy
""
this is just one of six hundred similar relics of soviet
inspiration clap out equipment and products that can't be sold
""
like all other heavy industries unless they can turn in a profit by
the end of the year they're finished
""
no more state subsidies
""
this company is working hard to improve the quality of these piers
hoping to sell them to western europe now that the communist markets are gone
""
the managers must learn not only to in turn a profit without
government help but must begin to pay its workers more and pay taxes to the
state
""
otherwise the private industrialist may take over
""
 word  who is now a special advisor to the
communist party's central committee was one of the main advocates of the
reforms in the eighties
""
he admits that duplicating the soviet model has been the main cause
of the country's failure
""
and how long will it take for the vietnamese to get into the
capitalist load of thinking
""
but not everything from the old order will need to be erased
""
in fact education under the socialist government has proved to be
unusually successful
""
today even when vietnam compares so miserably with other third
world countries in almost everything it is one of the most educated countries
in the world with more than ninety per cent literacy
""
this is no mean achievement especially when you consider the
turmoil war and revolution had caused
""
for historical and nationalistic reasons the vietnamese do not like
being too closely with the chinese
""
but it's not difficult for the visitors to see chinese influence in
vietnam
""
the buildings their language even their approach to work
""
in fact the current reforms in vietnam reflect the changes in china
""
as far as agriculture is concerned many believe they have taken off
""
in fact vietnam has always been a fairly successful agricultural
country until farmers were made to chase the communist dream
""
peasants had been forced into collectives
""
private property was outlawed and land owners persecuted
""
the result while the population grew food production fell
""
it got to such an alarming point that the collectives had to go
""
but not fast enough to stave off the threat of mass starvation just
four years ago
""
today these farmers know that the situation can become very bad but
they won't starve
""
they're free to farm on their own account
""
output has soared making vietnam the third largest rice producing
country
""
beyond that it's clear that there is no quick fix to an economy
plagued by decades of communism
""
the years of waste are clear everywhere for the eye to see and it
gets worse when you start to get down to the system or in this case the lack
of it
""
people say it's a lot better today but the infrastructure is still
desperately inadequate
""
electricity could go off for up to four days
""
roads are few and built mainly for bicycles
""
despite the liberal foreign investment laws the bureaucracy can be
maddening
""
it's a place for business only if you're very patient
""
and there are no real banking or legal supports in the way modern
businessmen are used to
""
mr  word  works for a foreign company in ho chi
min city
""
he knows the problems only too well
""
when everything came down from the top controls had been crucial
""
now that the economy is moving away from that the cracks are
beginning to show
""
the man in the street may be able to do his bit for private
enterprise by selling whatever he has for a profit
""
but to overhaul the entire system into an outward looking business
entity it's altogether a different matter
""
there simply aren't the right people with the right knowledge at
the middle and top to carry this out
""
this is where the foreigners must come in in a big way
""
two years ago vietnam opened the world's first floating hotel
""
it remains the only five star hotel in ho chi min city
""
but it's a start in getting foreign expertise and hard tourist
dollars in
""
the service industry is only one example of investors testing the
waters
""
more substantially the cheap labour and rich resources such as oil
and gas are attracting the taiwanese koreans and other asian investors in big
air loads by the day
""
that vietnam is virgin territory with a big potential market is
just one reason for them to take the plunge
""
for many asians and western investors vietnam has become part of
their asian diversification plan
""
keppel shipyard in singapore was one of the earliest pioneers
""
back in the mid-eighties they negotiated contracts with not just
the vietnamese but there soviet advisors as well
""
today keppel is in vietnam providing infrastructural support from
equipment for oil rigging shipyards and even backing support
""
what vietnam needs is clear
""
ideas and money to do things and to do them differently
""
old ideas have proved useless and old friends are now gone
""
the new friends are more important
""
they're richer and the new ties do not come with political
conditions
""
it's strictly business
""
but how would the vietnamese best use these ideas and money
""
this exchange of expertise is starting within vietnam
""
but with changes there would be other areas that the government
would need to look into
""
when almost everything is up for grabs you can encourage the wrong
types in those interested only in a quick buck leaving the vietnamese to pick
up the crumbs
""
like all third world countries in a haste to modernise the social
effects may not always be easy to control
""
in 1986 the government allowed youngsters into dance halls
""
it might have been against the socialist way of life but it
reduced the crime rate
""
today this is a common sight in ho chi min city
""
and the clubs have introduced other acts to lure their guests back
""
some of these acts can get just a little hot
""
by bangkok standards this may seem tame
""
in ho chi min city it's a walk on the wild side
""
and it gets wilder and wilder when you know where to look
""
and it's only at the beginning
""
the invasion of the foreigners hasn't happen in a big way
""
when the us embargo was finally lifted vietnam can expect more
investors and more social change 
""
but for now washington's seventeen year old embargo on trade and
aid to vietnam has an effect place the country off limits not only to the us
but its powerful allies as well
