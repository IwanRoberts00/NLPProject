good morning

i am christina eng
""
in am singapore today conservation by private home owners a new
constitution for south africa and consultancy work in the library services
""
if you think your home is of historical or architectural importance
you could get help to conserve it the urban redevelopment authority or ura is
starting a scheme called conservation initiated by private owners
""
basically this means that if you're if you own a building which you
think is worth preserving the ura may offer help such as reaping
redevelopment charges
""
usually conservation projects are initiated by the ura so why then
do they want private owners to make the first move now
""
koh eng jin manager of the ura conservation and urban design unit
explains to loh wee chin
""
""
no we all know that uhm besides the that areas that has been
gazetted for conservation and the additional areas uhm announced today uhm
throughout the entire island there are other buildings either in groups or in
a on a street block basis which has architectural and historical merit worthy
of conservation
""
now we would like to encourage owners who own such property to come
forward to ura and say i have a building i think it has merit and it it is
worthy to be considered for conservation and i like to participate in this
conservation scheme
""
and we would help to facilitate to make an assessment and
evaluation of the building and if it's found worthy of conservation we can
then facilitate the owners to go through the process of having their
properties gazetted for conservation
""
""
but many owners might not even realise that their buildings
are worth conserving after all they might just think it's a dirty old
building
""
how would they know if uhm what they live in or what they work in
is worth conserving
""
""
now we have a pamphlet that has been published and within the
pamphlet the we gave an idea of what has been our past effort so that will in
a way inform the public to you know in a way they can look at all the
buildings that has been gazetted and in fact we do have a good number for
numbers of building that has been restored so i think the owners could use
that as a point of reference to to evaluate in fact whether their building is
worthy of conservation
""
""
so you mean just like say walk around singapore and see what
has been conserved already and see if their own building matches up
""
""
yes i think precisely they can walk around town and they can
see the buildings being beautifully restored
""
in fact uhm i think most of us would not be able to realise that
how beautiful the buildings are because they have not been maintained over
the years
""
they look very run-down but if you look at those buildings that has
already been restored you will discover that the beauty that you have never
you know realised before
""
""
how many people have uhm come have offered their building for
conservation so far voluntarily
""
""
up to date we do receive a lot of enquiries
""
each month we get about a hundred enquiries to enquire whether
their buildings are worthy of conservation uhm and we do have instances where
the owners came forward and they say i think my building is worthy of
conservation and we have encouraged them to conserve
""
in fact there is one such case it at mayer road a bungalow house
victorian style bungalow
""
the plot of land under the master plan is allowed to redevelop as
an apartment
""
now the owner has conserved the bungalow and next to the bungalow
he has uhm proposed a block of apartments and he can use his bungalow for
communal facilities or even redesign the interior of the bungalow to make
them into apartment units
""
""
koh eng jin on the conservation of private houses
""
still to come on am singapore proposal for a new constitution in
south africa and a look at the new shell marketing centre
""
south african president f.w. de klerk has proposed a constitution
that will for the first time in the country history give blacks the right to
vote
""
it however denies them political domination instead it ensures
black-white par sharing through all levels of government
""
the plan will also see the creation of two houses in parliament the
first house would be made up of elected representatives proportionate to
their party's share of votes the second house which will have veto powers
over the first will be made up of an equal number of representatives from
south africa's nine regions
""
the south african i'm sorry the african national congress south
africa's biggest black political grouping has rejected the model claiming it
would result in a weak parliament
""
they also believe that the system of power-sharing would
effectively give whites the veto but are these things valid or is the anc
simply piqued at the prospect of never having majority rule
""
a short while ago
""
sansita badachajee was on the line with saer govinder a journalist
based in johannesburg
""
shia asked him first whether there was any significance in the
timing of the proposed constitution
""
""
you see over the past uh few months the right-wing in south
africa has been carrying out a uhm an intensive campaign against the national
party accusing the national party of selling out to white people in the
country and of a giving in to majority rule and of giving in to anc and so i
think de klerk in order to in order to try to uhm you know dilute or defuse
the the opposition against him uhm you know as as reveal the constitutional
proposals which uh which in a way what you call tries to provide some kind of
security for the white people and and and the he hopes that in this way that
he will be able to soothe the nerves and the fears of the of the white
minority but of course you know the conservative party has also rejected the
de klerk's constitutional proposals and has once again accused him of uh
leading the country to uhm to black majority rule
""
so you
""
 laugh  so you see that uh de klerk uhm uh you know while
while trying to win the support of the right-wing he's he's still being you
know criticized and condemned by the right-wing
""
""
well de klerk doesn't seem to have much luck with the anc
either they've rejected his proposal but why have they done so and what are
they looking for in in this new draft constitution
""
""
the anc believes firstly that it it wants a  word
 parliament whereby what you call the first chamber will be elected
on a one-person one-vote system which which is also uhm you know proposed by
the national party and that uh the representation in the first house of
parliament will be by proportional representation and the both the national
party and the anc support that but the only difference is that the anc does
agree with the national party insofar as the second chamber the devolution of
power to the regions and the the uh granting of more power to the people who
own properties rather than people who don't own properties
""
uhm the the anc believes that these are all mechanisms being
contrived by the national party in order to deny the the majority party in
any future and free elections to to form the government and to what you call
operate freely without any uh restrictions
""
""
uhm president de klerk has said that not all blacks supported
the anc and that he claims that millions and millions of blacks bet his party
in preventing too much power in the hands of one party or one leader is this
claim an empty one
""
""
well that's what he likes to believe i mean uh for instance uh
i i mean he uh the the the the incata zulu party does not support the anc but
the incata zulu party uhm is just to uh achieve popularity and the and some
of his people i mean they don't have the majority support of all the zulus
""
i mean uh president de klerk would like to believe that uh millions
of blacks support him but i mean the only way that uh uh we could uh we could
come to a situation where where political parties uhm registered and
supported by is is through free and fray elections and this is what uh the
anc and other progressive organisations in south africa are calling for
""
""
mr govinder on the demands of the african national congress
regarding the new constitution yesterday the congress of people's deputies
and the ussr rejected a draft of the union treaty sending it back to the
drawing board for more discussion
""
this came about after russia and the ukraine submitted further
amendments to the original bill
""
russian president boris yeltsin in the last minute move surprised
law-makers with an alternative proposal for setting up the much debated
confederation
""
yeltsin claimed that the proposed legislative body would leave
russia with a minority voice in a transitional parliament dominated by
conservative governments of other republics
""
but why has yeltsin made his proposal at such a last minute just
when congress was set to vote on it
""
a question pek siok lian asked civitologist tron gilberg earlier
this morning 
""
tg 
""
""
but how do you think the congress and the republics will
respond to his proposal
""
what about gorbachev then how do you think he is likely to react
""
""
tg 
""
""
well uhm the russian republic  word  has
also threatened to secede should the full-scale legislature not agree to
their alternative proposal
""
how great an influence will this threat have on the response of
gorbachev and the other republics do you think 
""
tg 
""
""
so civitologist tron gilberg bringing the time to three nine
minutes past seven here on am singapore
""
with the opening of its hundred and fifteen million dollar
marketing centre oil company shell has a three billion dollar stake in
singapore the installation takes over the inland distribution function of
products like petrol and diesel
""
it's linked to the pulau bukom refinery by submarine pipelines
which makes it possible to transport 2000 tons of oil in 6 to 7 hours an
operation which used to take a whole day
""
the centre also boasts of being environment-friendly
""
shell's marketing director sim siok lim describes to jane ong some
of the technology employed to achieve this such as double bottom tanks
""
""
all the tanks uh sit on a a second bottom which is made of a a
thick membrane uh of plastic material and this thick membrane is actually
laid in the ground uh beneath the foundation of the tank themselves for the
tanks are built uh and there are the membrane is so designed that should
there be a leak of any of the tank the oil does not seep beyond the top of
this membrane so that from that point of view it is it's safe
""
""
you also have uhm an equipment called the total ball plate
interceptor which cost more than one million dollars what does that do
""
""
as you know in uh oil in installation of this nature before
any water flows out of the installation uh all the drain water and surface
water uh has to be channelled through uh an approved uh design of interceptor
to make sure that any oil that's present in the water is separated from the
water before the water is allowed to exit the installation
""
now for this installation we have actually incorporated into it a
the latest design of such interceptor and that is called a tutable plate
interceptor
""
the feature of this filtable plate interceptor is that uh it has
the capability of uh streaming off as it were uh the oil so deeply that the
effluent water that eventually flows out has has got an absolute minimal
amount of oil present in it if any at all 
""
""
you also have uhm bottom loading siligentries
""
what is that supposed to do how safe is that for the environment
""
""
the bottom loading of tank trucks is the uh the latest method
for loading tank trucks
""
the advantage of bottom loading as uh against the uh more
conventional method of loading uh tank trucks via the top is that in bottom
loading we are able to construct a vapour return line to the storage tanks
and in that way as we load the tank trucks no vapour escapes into the
surrounding atmosphere are there any other safety measures that you've built
into this installation to make sure that it it is environmentally friendly
yes indeed uh other safety measures uh would include the way that the
submarine pipelines are are designed and constructed for instance and uh the
pipelines for instance are are laid well below uh psa's reserved taps uh for
the channels through which the pieplines pass uh the pipelines are also
protected by a very thick layer of of rock armoury uh which is designed to
prevent uh accidental uh dragging by anchors and uh this layer of armoury is
designed to withstand accidental dragging by anchors of ships up to a quarter
million tons in dead weight sim siok lim talking about the environment
friendly measures at the new shell marketing centre many private
organisations have a need to develop in-house libraries for their own
specific needs but most try to do it themselves using their own unqualified
staff salary turner a library service consultant does not advocate such a
practice she gives her reasons why so what services does a library consultant
provide and how can these small organisations get started and that was salary
turner once again we've come to the end of our programme so on behalf of 
i'm christina eng seng bye for now
