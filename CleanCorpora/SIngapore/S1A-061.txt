""
""
you know what he was doing the pragmatics
""
""
do you remember or not
""
""
i can't remember
""
""
i know we did one we did one but i only remember  word
""
""
""
socio sociolinguistics
""
last year
""
""
sociolinguistics i didn't do that what
""
i know what we did was for pragmatics
""
we did one remember
""
it was you were supposed to record down a conversation and you are
supposed to do the grician  word  principle
""
you supposed to apply grician principle to it
""
can you remember that or not
""
""
don't remember
""
""
the declarative whatever whatever and then they had the other
one was the weak forms
""
you get somebody to read out the thing and then you get the weak
forms
""
""
oh ya ya ya ya
""
that is true
""
aye someone very cute
""
look
""
the thing lor
""
it is very cute the poster
""
""
that one reminds me of elaine's elaine's file
""
""
elaine what
""
""
elaine what is her name
""
""
edward si warna  word 
""
that  word 
""
the long haired girl
""
""
elaine as in ivan elaine ong
""
""
oh okay
""
but the one she had is not of a cat isn't it
""
it is not on cats isn't it
""
it is on dogs
""
""
i know there is one where they were saying the wollen
 word  kept touching the nose molesting the dog
""
there is one with the nose one very cute
""
""
is it
""
wait he reminds me after the after getting the the file cover right
""
i wanted to put post cards you know of the dog and cats in it
""
then i can't bear to lah
""
""
why
""
""
because once you once you stick them down to the file right
then when you want to remove it next time like if you want to throw away the
file and you spoil the post card you see
""
""
don't stick ya
""
""
then
""
""
blue tac
""
""
really ah
""
""
i think so i mean that is what a lot of people do
""
""
ya ya because the last file i had i had this saint bernard
 word 
""
""
was that the
""
""
saint bernard's
""
ya the one that i was trying to tear out later
""
anyway the whole thing was spoilt so i had to throw the whole away
""
""
aiyah so sad
""
""
ya lah so sad because all my cats were there and my dogs
""
""
what did you do
""
you stick with double sided tape ah
""
""
ya i couldn't tear out after that
""
it was so it was really stuck there
""
""
poor thing
""
that means all the ones you throw away all the post cards you throw
away ah
""
""
ya ya
""
""
aiyah aye so poor thing
""
""
no lah i only had two nice ones
""
one was a the black and white picture of the cat and one that was
very nice the saint bernard that one
""
""
but my file lei
""
""
why
""
""
that day elaine tried to put for me
""
then it you know because the cover right it covers up to a certain
extent and then it covers the the button because mine has got a press stud
""
""
ya
""
""
so you cannot cannot close the file if you put the cover on
top because the cover will cover over the press stud
""
""
ya but why don't you do it at the at the bottom lor
""
""
only for the bottom then you might as well just laminate it
right
""
that means just the bottom
""
i mean just the back of the file only has one
""
""
oh i see what you mean
""
""
you know because the thing has a flap right so when it covers
the thing it there is a press stud right
""
""
oh you are talking about put putting post cards or pictures
there is it
""
""
my file can't at all because of the weird shape of the file
""
""
can nah because you see you have uhm right is a file then you
fold it down right
""
""
ya ya
""
""
then you can you can still this space here what for your
pictures
""
""
that is where my garfield and v c f sticker is lor
""
""
oh that that means you can't put anymore lah
""
""
ya
""
""
what what about at the back
""
""
at the back nice
""
""
empty
""
fine
""
""
because you see i if i put it at the back i need to cover it
so i will it will get very dirty
""
""
oh so you oh now you have only laminated your front is it
""
""
i never even laminated the front
""
what i did i just put a sticker and sticker are naturally laminated
already
""
i had the one with garfield and the green coloured ode the one that
linda was saying
""
you know then the v c f sticker i just wanted to cover the national
university of singapore writing
""
""
then you can laminate what
""
you put a picture at the back and then paste the  word
 stick it on
""
""
ma fun lah you laminate like that
""
""
why you go and buy such difficult
""
""
but i like i am i'm used to that type of file you know
""
since j c i had this the the one with the flap
""
""
that is why i hate the flap type
""
you know why
""
you can't put a lot of things in there
""
because of then button once you if you stack it up real high right
you can't close
""
""
ya but isn't it the same with the others
""
""
no
""
the ring file we can put at least about this thick you know the
stack of papers or whatever just put it there and it can still hold on to it
""
""
but it drops off right
""
""
ya ya lah
""
""
because people like me need the covering that flap right as
long as the flap can close ha
""
i guaran i can guarantee that the the paper won't fall down you
see
""
so i need that in case it has happened to me so many times already
in the bus right and then you hold the file like that in this
""
""
 word 
""
""
ya so embarrassing
""
""
you know what my friend does
""
she has you know the ordinary ring file you have this thing the
""
""
the clip
""
""
ya the clip here right
""
then you have the rings here right and here is where you always
put your papers and sometimes when your clip is too when when too many papers
to clip you can't clip everything there right
""
so what she does is that she puts the rest of the papers other
side and she buys those thick clips
""
""
oh
""
""
and she clips it there
""
""
oh ya i see what you mean
""
""
you know what i mean
""
""
oh no wonder a lot of people have those clips on their files
""
""
on their files quite useful ha
""
""
but i still cannot lah
""
i am still not used to it
""
i am still very used to that old type
""
""
he's got so many posters in his room
""
""
les miserables that l very nice
""
""
aye i know
""
are you going to watch
""
""
cannot lah so expensive a hundred over right for one ticket
""
""
for what
""
the tickets are one two six but that is only for american express
card holders
""
i think there are cheaper ones you know
""
""
my friend said she could cater for seventy you know because
either they bought in bulk or something like that
""
""
actually you can
""
i think the cheapest is seventy but uhm for for american card
holders when they send you the forms right i think they charge you one two
six
""
""
no because they said the tickets are seventy right and those
for seventy dollars you are getting the front row seats
""
""
since when
""
how
""
""
i don't know how she do it lah
""
she i think they bought in bulk a lot a lot so then they were
trying to get rid of it seventy
""
""
so is she trying to rid of it now
""
""
i don't know
""
kareen chow also wants me to go and fine out
""
""
can can can can
""
""
maybe i will find out for you lah whether the thing is
""
""
is lin is linda going
""
""
i don't think linda's going
""
she didn't say anything
""
""
then how come she she's got the pamphlet there
""
""
she can get pamphlet without buying the ticket what
""
""
but usually you don't like put it right in at the top of your
book you know without wanting to go
""
""
actually i want to go and see nutcracker suite but kareen
chow to see it so i didn't want to see
""
""
that is so mean
""
""
i know
""
no because he said he said he wanted somebody to see it with him
and then clara said that she would she would only go if somebody else would
go with them
""
""
clara as in what
""
""
clara as in the
""
""
sub com
""
""
ah sub com clara
""
so she only said she would go with kareen chow if somebody else
follows
""
so kareen chow asked me to go
""
would you go
""
""
depending on what is going on between the both of them
""
""
ya but i mean it is like even the invitation in itself is is
not sincere you know
""
""
no lah let's put it this way
""

other things aside
