public sector employees can look forward to receiving three
months bonus this year
""
it's similar to the amount given last year
""
this includes the one month non-pensionable annual allowance at the
end of the year
""
a statement from the finance ministry says there'll be no increase
in bonus payments because of the projected lower growth of four to six
percent this year it says the variable bonus of two months salary will be
paid in two parts
""
the first part amounting to three quarter month salary based on this
month's pay will be given next month the remaining one and one quarter month
will be paid in december if the economy performs as expected

but if the economy performs better than expected by the end of the
year the government will consider paying a special bonus
""
the statement says the annual wage commence from a zero point five
percentage point increase in employers' cpf amounts to a three point seven
percent increase in public sector pay

it's lower than the four point nine percent increase last year

this conforms to the national wages council's recommendation that
wage increase for this year should be moderated in line with the expected
slower economic growth
""
the ntuc welcomes the government's bonus decision but the singapore
federation of chambers of commerce and industry the sfcci is concerned that
the announcement will be used to press private sector employers for a
corresponding figure

it says this would be without regard to the company's profitability

company's profit position

these are contained in the recent nwc guidelines which it supports
