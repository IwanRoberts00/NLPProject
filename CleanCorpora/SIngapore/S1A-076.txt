it was fun right doctor low's i mean uhm miss low's
""
""
mrs low's class
""
""
mrs low's class yes yes
""
i i really miss the you know her uhm her style of teaching
""
i really enjoy her tutorials so much you know and together with pee
za we had so much fun then uhm and siang ling also
""
we used to be uhm actually i i we knew her style is uhm you know she
actually wanted to separate us you see
""
so we tried to stick together
""
""
oh yah i guess it's more comfortable with people you know but i
i like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us
to be when actually teaching
""
not like the others because i find some of them do uhm fail to
practise what they preach
""
ah well with all due respect to them
""
but somehow i wish those those lecturers in n u s went through this
course
""
""
ah yes
""
""
because i i think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to
know right how to uhm manage the o h t uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics
which i thought would be helpful to them because now i'm looking back i felt
find a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class
and how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university
""
because sometimes i just don't understand a lesson and i find uhm
i'm really communicating with the tutor
""
you know he's supposed to make sure i understand my work
""
""
oh yah
""
""
so i find uhm n u s tutors senior tutors and lecturers should
undergo some form of training to prepare them to impart their knowledge but
not just go straight into it after their qualifications or whatever
""
""
oh yes i think now they might have this course going on
because that day i i was in the library n i e library
""
then i saw this publication you know that says uh they have
actually trained uh uh trained a batch of n u s lecturers and the poly the
poly one polytechnic lecturers to undergo this course
""
""
and to go back and then and share what they've learnt
""
""
uh well it's course on uhm teaching them uhm you know teaching
techniques or lecturing techniques
""
""
i see i see oh i'm worried about that
""
""
yah it's a kind of a small group uh
""
i think probably only those new newer ones will get to try
""
probably the more senior ones maybe they
""
""
yah it won't be very nice to get them  word
""
""
""
so i think they're having it currently
""
but you you'd be surprise
""
""
but i still don't think that's enough
""
i i find everybody has to go through it not just uhm a selected few
""
""
oh yah i think so too
""
""
well anyway
""
""
probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you
know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying
""
""
yah anyhow but i'm enjoying this course so far lah
""
how about yourself
""
""
yah i'm enjoying myself but then
""
""
not that not that i'm learning a lot
""
it's like sometimes i i just sit through it for the sake of sitting
through it but on ocassionally i think about a quarter out of all times i do
find i learn something new
""
""
yes yes yes
""
""
a technique that i can uhm you know
""
""
use
""
""
share
""
uh something wholesome
""
""
yes but i actually personally speaking i prefer that uh that
small uhm direction from we ourselves rather than direction from lecturers
""
say for instance uhm maybe in fact for myself i'm interested in
transactional analysis so i really hope that i mean with the our kind of
curriculum we have uh is so heavy i i i just have to devote more time to
doing my actual school work rather than reading all this kind of things
""
i mean things that really interest me you see like aspects of
psychology in this area transactional analysis that actually
""
""
and then again if everybody does that there won't be uhm
enough time to tell you what you have to know
""
""
yah but i think actually frankly speaking it's very uhm
interesting you know
""
it's really good for teaching i mean besides uh pedagogical wise
and learning classroom management everything
""
i mean all all these we're like learning now i think having a
really good knowledge uh the psychologically makeup of people is very
important
""
that's what i think
""
because i have been reading this book by eric burn you know called
games people play
""
i think it's very good you know
""
i do not understand why it's not incorporated of
""
""
some kind of debonal kind of thing critical thinking
""
""
it's not only debonal uh critically thinking kind of thing uhm
but it's more of uhm analysis into why people engage in their dysfunctional
behaviour and this
""
""
like  word 
""
""
yes uh is it will help in like uh handling uh deviance
students or students with problems you know
""
i mean classroom management all the while
""
are you in classroom management course
""
""
no i didn't pick that because i don't know i i guess i like
semi-factual things than rather than uhm actual actually dealing with people
""
because i'm i my own strength is not very much in dealing with
people
""
don't ask me why i'm teaching
""
but yah when i took the rizac  word  test uhm
when we're talking about career development i i'm social skill is not of my
forte
""
it wasn't wasn't any things that i was good in
""
yah so and when teacher ask us to share you know our our conclusion
of of analysis of ourselves i was quite feeling quite sheepish about it
because i didn't have you know social that that letter s
""
""
i had artistic and then the other was uhm investigative and i
can't i think enterprising
""
""
oh oh oh
""
""
and that was it
""
but it takes all sorts of people to make the world
""
it doesn't mean uh
""
""
yah right
""
that's why i that how i i saw it
""
""
yah
""
""
and sometimes you may not know yourself as well as other
people know you
""
like i i keep telling my husband i'm not good with people
""
you're better
""
i'm more task-oriented
""
you're better with people so you go do the talking
""
but he he'll tell me hey no just give it a shot
""
i think your you can put yourself across quite well and you have a
listening ear
""
so i i just did it and sometimes i find myself doing quite a good
job you know when people have problems and they come to me
""
so many years i think you do have that kind of uhm uhm
""
""
maybe just that i don't see it myself
""
""
calm uh very calm cool uh kind of mannerisms and i think it's
good in that sense
""
""
i don't think it being a teacher means uhm you really have to
be very social and outgoing
""
""
yah like say we have a keep a distance also so i i think maybe
uh this coldness or what you call it will help me
""
because i i do find some of my friends becoming very close friends
with their students and i don't know if that's very healthy
""
""
yah
""
""
well i i find myself quite comfortable teaching especially
like when i'm interacting with the people
""
i'm giving tuition and so sometimes i i feel like i'm not sharing
enough like i'm not uhm communicative enough interacting enough with them to
build a good rapport
""
then again when i look back uhm i'm doing my job in helping them
improve their language skill so uhm what what more do i want you see and they
can relate with relate relate to me very well
""
they feel comfortable with me
""
so i think i mean and that's quite an achievement so you know those
""
""
yah don't discourage yourself
""
""
true
""
""
but but i still think uhm whether one has uhm an s or not in
that rizac uh test
""
it's still very important and crucial to a know uhm the
psychological makeup
""
each pupil uhm because uhm in fact even i check with my friends of
mine doing  word  problems uh they actually don't do much
of uhm really psycho analysising each pupil you see
""
i mean not really analysing a pupil's problems uhm all that things
you see or i mean even in p c c g also we don't have ready we don't really
have a counselling kind of setup you know
""
but we have already learnt counselling and things like that
""
it's just like we maybe because yah
""
""
lecturers uh gives information pupil respond teacher gives
feedback
""
""
yah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right
""
were you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse
the you know the conversation
""
""
yah i think it was time constraining
""
""
yah but i find that maybe they should actually enlarge this
area because it's i mean
""
""
give us a real mock up
""
""
yes
""
""
of counselling session or an actual class dealing with pastor
pastoral care
""
""
because otherwise then we'll be just like uh uhm i mean we we
are just dealing with symptoms and not the problems you know
""
they they will always these pupils will always come back and the
same problems and the same problems again right make them really frustrated
you see
""
""
yah but i think pastoral care is something uhm you can't
really learn as much as you can learn uhm classroom management because it has
to do a lot with your own values and how you approach problems yourself
because it's basically sharing yourself you know being a second parent to a
child
""
that was what i told the teacher but i guess she didn't find that
uhm fitting comfortably in her lesson plan so she kind of dismissed it
""
but i still after all these weeks i still think it it's basically
teaching you how to be second parent
""
""
yah true
""
it's yah it's really like
""
""
all inclusive everything you've got you just try your best to
help the child to become a better person
""
""
i i just wish they can incorporate more of this uhm things
maybe next year lah probably they will
""
""
more of you mean to expand
""
""
more counselling yes
""
""
the p c c g programme
""
""
yes more uh hand-on session practical sessions and more of uh
like uhm more new theories  word 
""
i mean those teacher theories that we learnt you know uh like uhm
the ones uhm uhm ericson uhm
""
""
yah right
""
""
uhm it's like kind of oldish already
""
i mean it's like all those skinner's behavioural i mean
modification
""
it's kind of it's already so back dated
""
that's what i find
""
i mean we should actually read up more or fraud's theory
""
it's very very bad dated
""
""
i find them too general
""
uhm they may be applicable still today but i find them too general
and uh like a lot of academic theories tend to be
""
so you wouldn't find any individual case fitting very nicely into
on one model
""
but uhm there are always variations and thing i mean we are
man-made anyway some man will continue making some more theories
""
uh yah but so far i can't say i haven't learnt anything but uh
it's just at the tip of the iceberg or maybe just the tip of the tip of the
iceberg
""
""
actually i learn i did learn a lot but it's just that uhm i
thought it could be better if they could incorporate uhm i mean give us more
time to pursue our own interest you know our own interested areas
""
uhm you know but but the curriculum is such that we we don't
really have much time for our own interest you see
""
i mean they're nice to give us uhm three-way plan 
""
""
i think i think it's they're strike a compromise already
with half the term half the course devoted to uh common subjects and the
other half to specific areas so uhm perhaps what you like would be one-third
common subjects and the other two-thirds specialisation
