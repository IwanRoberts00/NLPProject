good afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome to our wordstar for windows launch uhm today we'll be presenting to you the first ever recipient of pc user gold award winner which is of a word itself window and today's programme will also include a slide presentation by mr michael wee followed by a highlight of today's program a demonstration of wordstar for windows by ms irene khoo irene will also show you the correct grammar and the bitstream base lift which is also binded in our program after the coffee break we will have a round of lucky draw and several announcements so without further ado i'll like to call upon mr michael wee regional sales manager of wordstar asia to introduce wordstar for windows to you michael please don't please don't stop hi uh it's good to see all of you and it's very reassuring to know that the name wordstar can still draw this type of interest uh i know that's partly also due to the windows environment but i'm very very sure that most of you are here because of wordstar right say yes louder yes well we'll try again later afterwards alright you know many many years ago uh wordstar was the number one in the pc environment where wordprocessing is concerned and if i'm not wrong most of you if not all of you started using wordstar for the word-processing yes see i told you it's getting better good but then somewhere along the way uh we admit we slacken a little bit and thereby we let a lot of other competitors came into the picture they caught up with us and they have also to a certain extent overtaken us so much so that whenever now people are looking into word-processing perhaps one of the questions they will ask is why wordstar and not something else unlike before where is why something else and not the wordstar well for the first part of the presentation i'm going to show you why you should consider or reconsider wordstar because we have gone through a lot of changes so much so that we we're able to get our windows product out in time long before our competitor that is our main competitor i don't like to mention names here but uh i believe you know uh which one i'm referring to okay alright is it a bit too is it a bit too dark nuh okay okay alright because i've got to be able to see my script otherwise i'll won't be able to say what i'm supposed to say alright don't worry okay now despite the lapse uh that wordstar has fallen into we are actually still the number two wordprocessing company in terms of the number of units shipped alright we are the number two word-processor for dos units shipped it may surprise a lot of you but this is true uh okay just just before i carry on can those people at the back hear me oh you can hear me but you can't see me is it this light here okay can we have this lights it's much better now can you still see me but i have a problem here because now i can't see my script but that's alright we'd i'll just carry on from here uh we have sold over five million copies we have a strong brand name recognition and i think no one here will dispute that because even though many of you may have been using other word-processing software you will still know the name wordstar we have a proven distribution engine which i will show you because we have a very wide um distributor network that covers a lot of the countries we are the nineteenth largest pc software companies in states uh we employ about slightly less than 280 employees our last year revenue was thirty-five million alright we take a look at this graph you'll find that wordstar is number two in terms of its dos units shipped uh the first one of course you can see for yourself i won't tell you too much about that right we have overseas office in all these countries that you see here very few very few software companies do have this kind of coverage as we do they they do have distributors all over the world like like we do but they do not have the subsidiaries in this country the reason why we have set up subsidiaries in all these countries is because we realize we have to get close to the consumer we have to get close to people like in order to react faster to the market changes in order to know what you people want us to do and thereby come up with something better so this is a very different wordstar you are looking at now and what actually is different in wordstar well first of all we've now got a new leadership new management team uh if you are familiar or you're aware with the software industry in the states mr ron posner has now joined us as ceo mr posner has a very impressive track record in ashtontate in symantech now uh ye when he was there the companies have managed to triple or quadruple their earnings during his tenure in the companies there uh we've got a new product strategy of which you'll be seeing this this afternoon we've also focussed on very aggressive marketing we've done a lot of very aggressive funding agreement i'm sure you know about it in the past and this new management team has taken a different approach what mr ron posner is looking at is into software companies that he can buy that will be complementary to the wordstar hah i didn't know that thanks okay uh complementary products into the wordstar wordprocessing environment then we've now also because of this new management team we've managed to create a a new company image now product pres product strategy is to build wordprocessing into document management document management basically covers a wider arena of uh what wordprocessing is all about document management you'll be talking about desktop publishing you'll be talking about microfilms you'll be talking about laser worms and all these kind of things so we're building wordprocessing into this document management and in the near future you'll be seeing more products towards this aspect of course we'll keep upgrading our dos product dos at this present time remains a very important market to us even though windows as we all know is getting very popular but in terms of the number of installed units dos by far outskips windows still  you can and you need to access your uh head office information right you need your head office information at your fingertip all you need is one-touch tone telephone you make one phone call you can access your phone messages you can send phone messages your electronic mail right your computer mail can read to you over the phone we're talking about text-voice conversion it means it's like your sec your secretary reading the mail to you saying mr manager you know this is your letter blah blah blah blah everything dollars and cent how many thousand dollars how many cents you know the address and stuff like that it's very fast  customer: so uh what kind of e-mail system that it can able to what kind of computer do you have  let's say bayan buy or novell bayang or novell  uh is that ibm compatible without a pc it's a pcc uh it's ibm compatible i believe bayang word is ibm compatible yes uh it connects to ibm computer hp deck word  unisyss word  honeywell ncr a lot of computers eight or nine okay so so the electronic mail right it can read to you over the phone if you do not want it to read to you you want it in hard copy right that means on paper right you can tell the system send my electronic mail all my fax to the nearest fax machine that's closest to me say for example you're flying on a plane and there is a fax machine on the plane you can tell the system send my electronic mail and the fax to the fax machine on the plane itself so all you have to do is just walk up to the aisle from the to the  word fax machine just put there on the plane itself you can do all that anywhere in the world as long as you have a touch-tone telephone you can access all those information so the versatile versatility lies in the fact that your elec your computer mail computer uh fax can be converted into voice or into fax anywhere in the world  so uh to make up this system what what are the minimum uh software  okay you you need to buy this product called word  the computer is right over there you see the black box over there it says centigram voice-processing system you need to buy one of the box that's it  so this this system is a pc-based system or a  the box is some sort of computer a very specialized computer may have your own uh telephone word to uh sort of  you have a pbx in your office  yep ya we have must we connect to the pbx  sure if you it word connects to the pbx then you integrate everything because pbx is connected to the fax machine right vyour fax machine is connected to the pbx  but those whom without a pbx they cannot do all these  key telephone system also can best is pbx but key telephone system also can but very basic so this is very versatile very powerful  okay thank you  most welcome  bk can you show me this  okay this is based on uh this is using your word  technology okay say for example uhm you your ceo is on the tenth floor and you're on the fifth floor and your ceo wants to talk to you so the on your ceo computer there's a box down here that says voice and it has your phone number on it the ceo takes this pen uh light-pen and hit that box the computer will dial your extension and then you say yes mr ceo what can i do for you okay maybe he will say i want to talk to you about last month's sales progress okay so on uh your ceo will pull out a document from his pc on the screen right the same document will appear on your screen also so both of you are watching the same document and while you're having a voice-communica cation through the phone right that means a speaker phone you talk to him right at the same time you say yes mr ceo i i'm i think uh maybe you're looking at this figure at the same time you can see this is it so the thing is this is not restricted to just within the building you can it it can be done uhm different countries say you're in singapore ceo is in new york city okay he'll call you up it's as though like he's just next to you you don't have to fly from singapore to new york city and this is very cheap you don't have to buy pc and whatever it is uh you already have pc already right uh ibm compatible pc and ps2 or or ps ps2 there's a few cards you just slot inside it runs word  loads some software inside that is it  c2: it's sort of special monitor  it's not that's a normal printer all you need is the product is actually only a few cards and some software  c2: what are the cards that you  uhm it's it's it's inside uh  c2 is it in the brochure they gave us at the front  no there's no brochure for this we're we're just marketing this product we're not sellers we we just want to okay we want to introduce this product to all to the public let people know that this product is available see the the reason is isdn is too expensive for most people too expensive and because it's too expensive nobody wants to use it and because nobody want very few people want to use it problem correct so right now if you tell everybody and we have and we find out that there's a large demand for this then we can immediately lower down the isdn offer  this word technique uh so we're actually quite word c2: what is this product called uh it's called uh isdn information integrator c2: from which company it's uh joint-venture between an american company and british c2: not launched yet not launched yet this one is also not launched it's making its debut but uhm it will help uh it will be launched in a few months' time have i explained to you uh this one bk: no okay say for example you're an executive on the move right and you word you need some information from your head office at your fingertips and all you need is one touch of telephone you make one phone-call can access your phone messages you can send phone messages these are just some some of the crazy word there are some more much much more inside if i just want word  electronic mail it can read to you your electronic mail to you over the phone that means it's converting from text to word and or you can send uhm you can send your e-mail or your faxes to any fax machine that's nearest to you say like you're on you're on a plane there's a fax machine on the plane you can tell the system send the e-mail and the fax to you on the plane itself so very very powerful and it makes use of existing facilities just like existing facilities you need a few cards right so it make use of existing phone system computer system and a fax machine you already all have these in the office already right now the problem is they are not integrated they are not talking to each other they are all isolated so if you buy this uh product it integrates all these together so your this electronic mail can be converted into voice or converted into text anywhere in the world you have a touch-tone telephone can be accessed all these it's very very powerful bk: so this is the phone any phone bk: oh any phone you don't need a special phone a touch-tone telephone that's all bk: thank you welcome
