""
""
we are not having a formal debate we feel very
""
""
so what are you having
""
""
uh just an informal discussion
""
""
informal discussion uh so how what kind of informal discussion
you uh uh is one side going to raise a point and the other side counter
counter yourself or what
""
what are you going to do
""
""
i mean maybe we could just tell you what uhm what we have to
say and then you know if you have anything to to
""
""
add on or to ya you know
""
""
uh uhm okay
""
who's uh supposed to propose
""
""
my the three of us
""
""
three of you right three of you all okay so speak when you are
ready
""
""
we shall start with the definition of code and we define code
as being uhm oh ya from code uh he says that code is language and dialect and
it includes even sign languages also and from  word  he
says that code is uhm a series of signs right and its uhm correspondent
between form and meaning ya and uh and this excludes uhm the type of moral
and uh so uhm
""
""
so uhm we think that uh it is not enough neither is it
sufficient sorry it is not sufficient nor necessary 'cos you have to take
context into account like uhm context will give you the utterance meaning
""
for example uh the cha kway teow you go to the cha kway teow man
you said one fifty he'll know it's uhm one fifty worth of cha kway teow but
if you were to go out and say one fifty to any passerby uhm something will
happen
""
""
i mean besides besides that uhm local and geographical
variations uhm for words like uhm gas and petrol uhm is american but petrol
is more towards singapore so uhm if you use the word gas in singapore people
might think that if you wanna buy you wanna you know order a tank of gas for
your kitchen stove or something
""
so different ideas behind the words and uhm like gail was saying
for the word home different people have different ideas or different values
attached to it right
""
""
because they experience uhm it differently i mean in the sense
that for some people home would be uhm very good uh very happy comfortable
sort of idea whereas to some other people it might mean uhm like uh a broken
home where beatings and drunken well whatever ah you know that kind of thing
ya so it depends on experiences also
""
""
say opposition what what you want to say to their points so
far
""
""
uhm i think what gail says contradicts what shirley says
because gail says that uhm in the definition of code you exclude world but
then according to shirley uhm context would therefore include world so i
think that's contradiction there and uhm
""
""
ya but we are sup we are proposing this motion right which
should that we are we define the motion as being a correspondents between
form and meaning and we are saying that world is important also so that's why
context's important
""
""
ya but just now you exclude world
""
""
you said ya the definition of code ya that's why that's why we
are propose ya it's not sufficient not  word  you know
""
""
okay okay uhm i'll do on that  word  our
definition right uhm
""
when you talk of code we would we also refer to it as a system of
uhm meaning and form correspondents and uhm our code can be verbal and it can
be non-verbal is that uhm
""
when we talk of verbal code we refer it to the same language and
non-verbal code will then include things like signals sign language body
language etcetera and when we talk about shared code uhm one question that
pops into mind is how shared is considered shared right
""
uhm we'll like to define it as when two speakers uhm share a shared
code they have to be both uhm possessing adequate knowledge of this language
in order to understand internal assumptions utterance meaning sarcasm
idiomatic phrases etcetera
""
so this will constitute what shared means
""
now uhm for necessary and sufficient if you were to refer to kobe
for logic uhm logic uhm what a necessary condition would mean would that be
that it it's a circumstance in which uhm  word  absence
the event cannot occur that is without a shared code putting it in this uhm
context without a shared code we cannot have human communication right
""
another example if we were to look oxygen and combustion we say
that oxygen is a necessary condition for combustion because without oxygen no
conden no combustion can take place
""
now if we were to look at sufficient condition a sufficient
condition would be a circumstance in which in whose presence the event must
occur
""
for example if we say that uhm combustion occurs then uhm oxygen
must be present
""
but oxygen is not a sufficient condition because you can have
oxygen being present and yet no combustion
""
so a sufficient condition would necessary uhm necessarily uhm uhm
entail a subset of necessary conditions in that in this case if you want
condi combustion you need uhm you need oxygen and many other things many
other things
""
so what do you understand  laughter 
""
thank you
""
so what we are saying is that uhm for human condition uh
communication to take place we need we need we needs uhm we need a shared
code but this shared code is necessary as well as being sufficient
""
but being necessary is a subset of being sufficient you know
""
alright
""
if you were to look at the true table can can i draw out the truth
table
""
""
by all means
""
""
okay uhm  laughter 
""
if we were to take necessary condition as p and sufficient
condition as q so uhm we do it this way
""
so if p is necessary condition ah p is sufficient condition and q
is necessary condition neither necessary nor sufficient will be not bracket p
or q so this case is true only when both p and q is false
""
so uhm if you want to say that this statement is true you have to
prove to us that it is not necessary as well as not sufficient
""
but what we are trying to say that is that we are we we we can
prove either of this three cases
""
see we can prove that it is just necessary or you can prove that it
is just sufficient or you can prove that it is both necessary and and and
sufficient and ours case stands here okay
""
""
okay  laughter 
""
""
right and the last point is uhm for human communication
""
when you talk about human communication we want to limit it to
being uhm just effective communication in that uhm there must the hearer must
decode the message the same way that the speaker intends it so that is
effective communication
""
uhm so
""
""
so that's that uhm  word 
""
""
we are not saying that shared code is sufficient we are saying
that it is necessary
""
that means it encompasses it can encompass other things as well you
see
""
""
in fact in our definition of a shared code we've already
included right we included non-verbal communication utterance meaning
""
""
so so the world is  word  we are saying
that a shared code
""
""
but you just
""
""
we are not saying that
""
""
in your definition you said that shared code uhm a code is
form and meaning only you didn't say  word 
""
""
we we believe that it's part of it is an essential form and
meaning you see but you're going to
""
""
so you're going to have  word  column and
second column
""
""
yes because you see when you talk about under jakobson right
if you talk about when he talks about code under the functions of language
right he uses it as the language that is used you see in in communication and
things like that and under that language itself right it is the verbal
language right what you say to each other
""
and also other uhm signs like non-verbal language communication as
well as utterance meaning and all that
""
it all comes under the heading of language you see and as a result
it comes under the heading of codes
""
that's how our definition comes about
""
""
okay now if i may interject uh for a while i think this this
debate is kind of a digressing a little bit from what you're supposed to be
talking about
""
ah this thing about the the code you talk about whether it includes
the world or doesn't include the world
""
it's quite a  word  point really it's not a
point worth debating because you're given this you know in your two zero
three you're given this form meaning well thing right and your your well from
your reading okay you read it you read that shared code is a system a system
of signs right system of signs and what is a sign
""
a sign is a okay a sign is something which ties form and meaning
right which is a you know the the classic sausurrean definition of a sign
where you
""
now when the the word sign is used by the structural linguists you
know from sausure's time the way they use meaning there is not the same as
this framework which you've been given two zero three this form meaning world
this fmw thing
""
in fact this fmw thing okay this is just an incidental point which
i'm just saying to you now
""
it's it's just an abstraction alright just a framework uh which dr
ferris is using himself okay which i personally i don't believe in okay
""
the kind of semantics that i do ah ah this to me this is this is
bullshit okay but for your purposes for exam purposes you know if you
 laughter 
""
alright
""
so when we talk about meaning in terms of uh the linguistic sign or
whatever sign uhm it does not necessarily refer to just this this m alone
okay could refer to to your w as well
""
because when we talk about meaning okay in the sausurean sense it
can be sense as well as reference alright
""
it doesn't have to exclude a w so let's just get that aside for the
time being okay
""
now  word  okay uhm so now what you have to show
as a proposition is that this this shared code uh is number one it's not
necessary and number two it's not sufficient
""
you have to show these two alright
""
now so far you haven't really come up with any uh argument any
strong argument you have mentioned something about okay the importance of
context uh the cha kway teow thing right so that perhaps is an argument for
why it's not sufficient but you haven't really argued why it is not necessary
right
""
of course on your part as the opposition uh in a way you have an
easier task because right they have to show the proposition has to show that
it is one  word  not necessary as well as not sufficient
""
right you have to show both as the proposition
""
as the opposition all you have to do is to refute just one of these
you don't have to refute both right
""
they have to show both
""
all you have to do is refute one of those and your your case is
done right so in a sense it's easier for you so it depends on what kind of
argument you come up with
""
who wants to take it up again
""
""
okay in other words you said that okay talking about if i
 word  use jan jakobson's six elements of communication
right he list down addresser addressee
""
uhm sorry context message
""
uhm contact and code as the six necessary constituents so you say
that if you say that the code a shared code is sufficient 
""
that means you are not taking into account the other five uhm
necessary elements right so in other words you're saying that if i have a
shared code uhm and i look at angie angie knows what i'm saying to her
 laughter  because what mental  word  thapy
