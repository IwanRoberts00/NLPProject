""
""
a back header by hitomo into the path of hadiyono or rather puteray this is
puteray hadiyono or yes and that has given the indonesians the lead
""
it took david by complete surprise coming in the eighth minute of play
""
let's watch this again
""
puteray sending the ball into the path of husaini who blasted the ball past
a very surprised david lee to give the indonesians the lead
""
fafri husaini the man to open counts for indonesia and that
has not only taken david by surprise
""
ational stadium by complete surprise
""
so the indonesians take an early lead in the eighth minute of this asian
cup group four qualifying round
""
is this going to set singapore back or will this sting ramp into retaliation
""
we hope that they have the character to pull the game up now
""
""
they'd better because if they lose this they don't even have one point
after two matches and if china beat malaysia that automatically eliminates
singapore
""
then china will have taken four points
""
""
and coverchecks certainly looks like very dejected a person at the moment
""
no team official would like to see his team going or trailing the opposition
in such an early time in this match with only eight
minutes of play gone by the indonesians getting themselves into the lead
""
can pabanathan once again inspire the boys onto the equalizer
""
latif abdullah and eunos moktar is there for indonesia
""
hadiyono hadiyono once again
""
pabah collecting it very calmly
""
haslim kannan
""
razali said moving up right now
""
he's got devaraj on the right and he makes uses of devaraj
""
he's across coming in
""
yes he does and eddie haditono beats
kannan to the ball first to the ball eddie hato
""
this is that one man who's gotta gotta prove to be a real
stumbling block to the singapore team in their search for the equaliser
""
""
it's not just eddie hato
""
the warning signs were there earlier on
""
the indonesians were going in harder
""
they seem half a step fast and i think to goal
""
if we do get to see it again you'll see that the defenders back off the number
nine widodo putro and he ran all the way into the box before he laid that
ball back for pakri to take that shot and it was too well placed for david
""
it's right in the side netting
""
""
zainal pamah deveraj back to his captain
""
haslim devaraj missing that one
""
indonesia saying thank you very much and come away once again
""
sydney pitono looking for husaini
""
haslim down in defence
""
the indonesians are just toying around in the singapore defence looking for
players who are running into open spaces just uh picking their men up and
knocking the ball around
""
husaini up front still ahead
""
pamah tidying up for singapore
""
tong hai giving it to david lee
""
putiray for you and now razali said
""
zainal there's gonna be some switch of uh players
""
tong hai i notice has moved over to the left
""
pull back position
""
zanial from the left pull back position has moved over to the right
""
pamah must have uh made a couple of uh decisions on the spur of the moment
""
looking at the indonesians who are moving around menacingly especially
puteray and hitomo the indonesian's number nine and ten
""
sudirman
""
it's a long one opening up the game
""
over to puteray
""
going nowhere except to singapore's captain zainal
""
latiff abdullah the shortest player but he's reputed to be the fittest
player in the singapore side
""
he's been given the opportunity to prove to prove that to the more than
thirty-five thousand fans here in the national stadium today
""
and another menacing indonesian attack hitting the upright going out of
play off for singapore and it's going to be the first corner the
first corner for the indonesians in fact
""
""
and that was a long time coming but once again you can see that number
seven man widodo putro
""
he had just too much time
""
the all the defenders were just backing off and giving him all the time
in the world to run right through
""
""
the indonesians taking their first corner
""
widodo putro
""
quarter of an hour gone by
""
if you have just joined us let me tell you that uh singapore are trailing
indonesian by one goal to nil
""
the goal coming in the eighth minute through fafri husaini
""
free kick to the indonesians inspired by that uh early goal
""
they're going to be piling on the pressure on this singapore side
""
razali organising his defence
""
papa nathan the indonesians referee and they fail to keep that ball in place
""
nearly a goal kick to singapore
""
""
by the way the game is going now one doesn't give singapore much of a hope
""
they seem to be disorganised
""
latiff i presume he's nervous on his debut
""
he's been a a trifle too anxious and i hope he settles down and has a
good game
""
""
k kannan for singapore
""
haslim harom right now picking up
""
devaraj and devar is another one of those players who has yet to settle down
""
""
and he hasn't
""
his touches have been a bit slack
""
he hasn't played the ball with any conviction and he has left it short on
a couple of occasions
""
""
the ever reliable pamah nathan
""
good pressure on the indonesians giving possession to singapore
""
hasnian sending kannan through uh tuckey john it is
""
and what is it
""
the refugee place advantage
""
tuckey john lost his balance
""
haji santoso for indonesia
""
the singapore boys should apply a lot more pressure on the indonesians uh
especially in the middle of the park like what they did just a little
while ago thereby winning the ball once again
""
but right now they seem to be taking things in their stride and just
dictating the pace of the game
""
the indonesians seem to be uh playing the ball around so easily without
much pressure really from the singapore side
""
""
and that relates your observation which is a good one brian
they're best
""
they're just backing off
""
they're not going in hard and you know challenging the indonesians
""
i rather suspect they're afraid of the the pace
""
the indonesians do have some very pacey boys and they're just giving
them you know an extra yard or two which indonesians right now are
taking full advantage of
""
""
well the boys are falling into the same trap as in the in their opening
match against malaysia where they were back dabbling especially so in
the first half and they allowed the malaysians to take complete control
of the first forty-five minutes
""
and that's exactly what's happening here
""
a repeat of the first half in singapore's open tie against malaysia
""
but fortunately for singapore yes latiff abdullah with the first real good
attempt at the indonesian goal
""
latiff abdullah giving some hope for their singapore fans here in the
national stadium
""
we'll watch that again
""
a very ambitious a very brave attempt by latiff abdullah
""
""
he's got the right idea
""
he might have to get in a bit closer because he's not going to be a goalie
like eddie hato from that kind of range unless it's a a phenomenal shot
which just finds a top corner or something
""
""
but at least uh our strikers ought to take the cue from latiff abdullah
and uh start shooting outside because otherwise if you have too much
respect for haltoh you'll never get the goals without trying
""
the fans getting a little impatient right now where singapore trail the
indonesians from an early lead given by fafri husaini in the eighth minute
of play
""
so the indonesians are leading singapore one goal to nil after twenty
minutes of this first half and the indonesians are pulling back once again
""
rozali sahad puts his  word  away widodo putra giving
possession to eunos moktar and right now sudirman
""
up front for pitono haslim
""
tong hai sending it away to touch for a throw in to the indonesians
""
the indonesians seem to be enjoying dictating the game and our singapore
will have to do something about the opportunity of uh taking advantage
of possession as they move up instead of giving those balls away
""
latiff abdullah looking for devaraj haslim up front for kannan and he is
at an outside position
""
david lee has come back once again
""
sudirman
""
they seem to be quite happy just retaining possession
""
as long as you have possession there's nothing the opposition can do
and this is exactly the predicament that the singapore boys are in at
the moment
""
""
he's compounding the effect that they're trailing one nil
""
they got to get the ball back somehow
""
and they're still allowing the indonesians way too much space
""
""
a good block there by abdullah latiff and now singapore have the ball
once again
""
tong hai zainal or that's deva deva once again
""
razali said kannan and a chance here for singapore
""
oh yes
""
""
that's a great goal
""
""
what a brilliant goal there scored by razali said
""
a saving equalizer from razali said and that came about in the
twenty-second minute of play
""
oh we just love to watch that again
""
what a beauty of a goal
""
what a beauty of a strike
""
""
oh my god look at that brilliant and that was the first really good move
that singapore had
""
they knocked the ball above beautifully stringing their passes together
""
and that was unstoppable unstoppable
""
""
now razali said has been known to have scored goals from what uh twenty
thirty metres out and there you are
""
he has just proven very well
""
that's uh what a relieve indeed for mish covercheck
""
so that puts singapore back on terms and the teams are back to square
one once again giving singapore some hope in their second match in this
asian cup group four qualifying round
""
and i just love the way razali said picked his spot and pelted the ball in
""
in fact we have seen two great goals today
""
""
yah two excellent shots
""
i don't think the goal either goalie had a chance in the two goals
""
spark preeze was deep in the the side netting and the ball actually stuck
there trapped between this tension and the net and razali's was unstoppable
""
""
and the fans are certainly celebrating with the kallang wave
""
this is our very own version of the mexican wave
""
oh yes
""
what joy
""
what celebration from the terraces
""
and back to play right now but the indonesians are coming back relentlessly
""
they are attacking in waves as well
""
they certainly want to win this match after having lost to china in
their opening tie
""
two players committing themselves but uh terry pathanathan is so so
for sure that he goes in
""
he knows that he's gonna get the ball and he gets it
""
what a first half this is turning out to be
""
both teams starting off very cautiously but with indonesians taking
singapore by surprise in the eighth minute with a goal from husaini
suddenly found their lead being cancelled by razali said with a
really marvellous goal that had eddie hato beaten
""
there was no chance at all
""
tong hai going up for that one save inside
""
zainal was there doing good service for singapore
""
their tails are up and now they're putting on a spur of display for
the more than thirty-five thousand fans here at the national stadium
as singapore go the attack
""
haslim harun at the farside gets his cross in
""
tocky john only down for aldi santoso and from there it goes to moktar
""
that's the russian coach in charge of this indonesian side
""
oh an opportunity that gave indonesia's way to give them the lead once
again but this time david lee was certainly on his toes
""
he read that very well
""
""
yes he did and he's quick off his line and if he wasn't there that
would have been two one to indonesia well played by david 
""
""
so now singapore with that uh saving goal from razali said have a
glimmer of hope once again with indonesians taking the singapore
team off their strive regaining possession they come back once
again husaini but he fails to beat haslim this time zulkifli
and razali said they're back at the moment
