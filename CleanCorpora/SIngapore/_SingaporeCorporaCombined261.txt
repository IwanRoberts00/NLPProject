this evening's campaigning for the general election four parties are now holding rallies the pap is holding a rally instead of a dialogue session this evening at eunos grc the workers party is holding two rallies one in hougang and the other in bedok grc the singapore democratic party is campaigning in braddell heights and nee soon central and the pkms in ayer rajah at a workers' party in hougang dr lee siew choh its candidate for eunos grc said there's no democracy in singapore when you talk about democracy you would allow people to hold small meetings together discuss political issues of the day so that you know they can exchange views and maybe make suggestions to the government but in singapore you are not allowed to do that if you speak up and you speak up against the government they may take action against you therefore it becomes very difficult for people to gather to talk about things many people have a lot of views they discuss it behind the scene they talk it in their rooms in their family circle between friends in club maybe but if you were to ask them to come out openly and identify themselves with the opposition they have to say they dare not therefore in singapore today there is an atmosphere of fear and this atmosphere of fear we must try and get rid of everybody must help to get rid of this fear at the sdp rally its candidate for braddell heights said the pap has been lucky so far in nineteen sixty three the pap dominant dominating the whole of the political environment of singapore now there are such reason there there were reason for that where we know we understand because at that time it's a turbulent world not only that singapore is in trouble where poverty unemployment but the whole world is such you look and recall in nineteen sixty in india in china they are not as good as today so the whole world has progressed progressed over the thirty years so the pap they are in a way very lucky that they are in power for the last thirty years and when they talk about the achievement of today in singapore they said this is achievement by us by pap not by you i think that is absolutely wrong without the support without the hardworking of the people no government can success speaking later the same rally the party secretary-general mr chiam see tong says it is wrong to believe that the opposition does not support the good efforts of the pap the pap has always try to make it a bad picture of the opposition they want to always make it as if the opposition wants to stop progress it is absolutely not true we are singaporeans we are in the opposition why? because we are concerned for our country therefore it is wrong to say that we want to hold back progress it's absolutely not true in fact if the government does good things we will say yes please do more for the people we should not say because it is done by pap no no no good we don't want if the pap wants to build hospital here we said okay please go ahead build one more we don't mind if they get the name for it because it's good for singapore it does not mean that because it is done by the pap we say it's bad we are constructive we are supportive of all good cause and in fact it is our duty to make sure the pap do only good for singapore the singapore malay national organisation pkms held their first rally this evening in ayer rajah candidates touched on the racial harmony the rising cost of living and criticise the next lap its candidate for jurong mr word said the publication did not have what he called soul it's in the next lap you must word  scrutinise it and understand it then you will see some thing emerging a monster and a frankenstein so that is why we demand that uh if the pap are sincere we demand to know who are the office of the next lap and we demand to know what books of references they referred to when they compile this book and we demand to know the sources of that knowledge name your books the pap name your books of reference and you will be rest assured that we dare probe into the sources of their knowledge but with the caution of our soul at the pap rally in eunos the prime minister mr goh chok tong took to task the workers' party mr jufrie mahmood for mixing religion with politics he said mr jufrie's been making communal and religious insinuations and word definitely agitating the malay ground by speaking only in malay in the hope that chinese voters won't know what he's saying mr goh cited several instances when this was done at workers' party rally last week mr jufrie accused his pap opponent mr sidek saniff of selling out the malays and of attempts to buy the malays mr goh said in the last election mr jufrie also attacked pap malay mps repeatedly for taking a moderate line and working in co-operation with the pap government to improve the lot of the malays instead of taking a confrontational stance i'm happy that jufrie has come up openly with his position yes sidek saniff supported the tertiary scheme proposal he was in the forefront persuading malays those malays who can afford it to give up the privilege of free university education he wants them to pay and he wants the money to be given to mendaki to help the poorer malays and this policy is not sidek's policy it is my policy i suggested it our policy is right because our policy is aimed at making the malays help themselves so that they can compete with the chinese and indians and at the end of the road they can do well and they can claim that it is through their own merit and ability that they are able to stand tall now as for separation of religion and politics sidek saniff believes that politics and religion must not mix it is too potent a mixture if you mix politics with islam you allow buddhism to be mixed with politics you mix politics with christianity then that spells for trouble so he's speaking out of his heart when he supports the separation of politics from religion but jufrie says that is wrong he wants to mix religion with politics well you try and do that in singapore you are going to end up with a big fire right away just look at india look at sri lanka where politics are mixed with religion what has happened in india what has happened in sri lanka will happen very quickly in singapore if we mix religion with politics january nineteen eighty-five i was appointed deputy prime minister you can trace the record between nineteen eight-five and now to see what we have done to fulfill a promise in that document word nineteen ninety-nine mrt we've got it today indoor stadium we said we we would build it we have built it town councils we have got them hdb refurbishing on the way pilot projects are now being done in six areas so that program is on the way mendaki formed mendaki one mendaki two i said we should form a special committee to help the malays mendaki two has been formed and now we are going in for sinda to help the indians and after we have helped the lower income indians after we have formed sinda we are going to form a development assistance committee for the chinese there are also poor chinese don't think all chinese are rich in fact there are more poor chinese than poor malays and indians put together so we will focus our attention to help the lower income chinese if i succeed in forcing a bond with you i meet you at dialogue sessions once in two weeks after election i go down i give the meet the people face to face there is no need for opposition and if pap leaders become arrogant please give us a knock on the head no it it is possible that sometimes ideas get to get into our head if there are very few opposition members in parliament it is possible that we become complacent we become a little swell-headed i say it is possible for myself i don't think that is possible i cannot change but assuming that it is possible you will be our safeguard you will be the people who will check us the pap the government are now big enough to accommodate a range of views in our early days we would not tolerate dissenting viewpoints we were like a samphan and we believe like a samphan you cannot allow people to tussle to quarrel on a samphan because the samphan will capsize but today i believe we are more like a big boat the bottom is flatter it is very flatter very like a ferry you see like a ferry correct like a ferry thank you that's what i meant by participation of the people i did not have the right word or the right metaphor but the idea grew forth ferry yes on a ferry we can we can accommodate a range of opinions and i have allowed encouraged people to air their opinions now you read the straits times you read sbc you watch sbc people now criticise the government they come up with alternative ideas opposition are free to criticise us i said go ahead so long as we know that certina areas are off limit like language religion race so long as we keep away from these areas it is alright you can criticise my program you can criticise my style you can offer a better style a better program i accept and if ideas are good i co-opt them again which is why the opposition has not come up with any ideas first i think they are incapable of coming up with ideas and if they have to help us to govern you know what i will do i will co-opt their ideas so in parliament if in parliament or outside they do come up with an idea to help me govern singapore better i will say thank you very much mr chiam i'm going to implement it and if i do that my government will become better say my government becomes better by nineteen ninety-six there'll be no chance for mr chiam polling will take place this saturday and the counting of ballot papers will be carried out at eight centres anderson junior college eastview secondary school jintai secondary

occasional showers in the early hours the temperature twenty-five to thirtyone degrees and now to end the main news again president gorbachev has told the soviet parliament that presidential and
