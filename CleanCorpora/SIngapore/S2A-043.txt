""
""
they are all r and d people
""
they take the plunge and they make it
""
the world is fuming  word  around r and d people
""
there's no kidding right and uh this man from uh i think he's uh the
chairman of a matsushita or something like that
""
he says that the creation of product leads to the creation of wealth
""
so as far as these people you are one of a pillars of success
""
there are three pillars products marketing and finance
""
so you have no money you have no market institute go for r and d
""
right that's how i got started
""
okay i i'm going to scrap through uh you know we might as well tell
you how i got started in r and d
""
it's just like telling a story you know but uh maybe i just briefly
run through it and uh and uh see whether the you know you will get inspired
""
first of all i believe i am a inquisitive person very curious
""
i refuse to accept what someone tells me until i try out myself
okay and i think that is one quality i believe in a r and d person
""
if you were to accept anything somebody tells you then i think you
are a forward not a innovative not a leader
""
in order to be number one you have to lead
""
you have to come with ideas
""
you can't just accept okay
""
so back in school i remember one uh one project that i i did how to
how to build a a high voltage converter
""
i know nothing about electronics okay so i had a little magazine
that says how you can you can solve or generate a high voltage
""
and uh it was like uh using a nail and you will have a front-wire
and with your next  word  break switch in a battery
""
on outside you have secondary coil so in same place you will
connect all this together and put the switch on and off you will generate a
high voltage
""
actually it works but to implement that was difficult
""
so how will you go about implementing such a a a idea into a pro a
local product
""
so what i did was i took a bell you know electric bell take out
external wire and wire another coil on the other side
""
it generates a high voltage a couple of hundred volts and i what i
did was i took a bolt and put that into a into the hollow output put a
metallic meta uh foil on it connect the two wires to it
""
i had a lot of playboy magazines uh photograph on top stick it on
and plug the bolt in my friends
""
so when they open the bolt they got a very shock of their life
""
so this is some things that i uh did and there's  word
 r and d
""
the interest in uh wanting to create product okay
""
so apparently there's a when i rave on r and d was my my lecturer
in the universities got me a job in the summer vacation help him to build up
uh certain uh you products that he was doing
""
i got stuck was interesting you know
""
uh i couldn't sleep i was trying to to you know figure out one day
or come back to work on mondays
""
you are crazy you know
""
so if you want to do r and d do you have this in you
""
this is not it's not a nine-to-five job it's nine to three a m
""
sometimes okay so don't tell me i have to go home to have dinner
with my mummy or with my girlfriends or boyfriends
""
forget it and if for three years if you want to be really good
forget about all these social dates
""
just look at mister sim mister sim of creative technology he's
still a
""
i'm sorry i but i guess so he's got no time from girlfriends
""
but he's such he's on the extreme side okay
""
he's very wealthy so you don't have to be so wealthy you still can
have girlfriends and boyfriends you know
""
so if you were to ask me why i go into r and d i'll give you two
answers
""
fore thing first of all i will say because of interest of an ideal
of a dream you know that like you fresh out of university
""
i think i know everything you know and go in blow a lot of chips
you know come as a you know
""
you expect the the wires to be zero resistance it's not
""
you know you think that you can run a a higher crazy uh stuff on
the long wires you you fail miserably  word  you know
""
so there are two answers
""
now i'll say after fourteen years of doing r and d i would go to r
and d because it give you the opportunity to be your own boss
""
with that knowledge in you you see i will tell if you leave during
this university now or junior colleges now you go out to work two years later
everything is gone
""
you'll only retain between three to five per cent of what you're
taught
""
you'll only remember we  word  is to i 
word  tower  word  i  word 
saw  word 
""
everything else what accounts extrapolation all secondary all given
back to your lecturer
""
you don't need that anymore
""
it's all gut feel
""
you touch the a board you suppose to know where the the the the
board is like a doctor you know
""
let's say i think you've got a slight fever you know something like
that
""
okay this is all gut feel okay
""
after a while experience comes in
""
you look at the board you're  word  is on the
line you have ground problems
""
the textbook never teach you
""
it's all hard work
""
someone one says successful product of man is ninety-nine per cent
perspiration one per cent inspiration okay
""
so you finish nine per cent very fast the ten per cent take you
ninety per cent all the time
""
so the reason why i would like to see more of you guys go into r
and d is because it gives you the opportunity uh to first go into any area
you want right
""
from r and d you can go into marketing
""
you make a super marketing man
""
why
""
because you know how to use a soak  word  better
than anybody else
""
if you have not done r and d first you go into sales you try to use
a soak in front of a customer you can't even trigger it
""
you think how your customer feels right
""
it's that's a fact
""
so you think that unless you go into say sales three years' later
become a manager
""
by the time you have given back everything to your lecturer you are
just like any other person
""
can be a a accounts student or business student vying for the same
job
""
where is your competitive edge
""
you have no compete you have no advantage
""
the only way to stay a to stay ahead is to have that niche a
competitive edge
""
that's a fact right
""
if everybody were to say so you want two thousand dollars give him
one two thousand dollars
""
how can i provide one thousand dollars
""
so if do r and d you specialise three years later your foundation
is laid
""
you can go to sales if you are still good carry on r and d
""
after five years you've got a lot products hiding in your mind go
and see a banker or investor and say i'll like to start a company with you
and for my share what i do
""
you put ninety per per cent of the money you give ten per cent of
the share free i still get my salary
""
and that's it that's how you get started without any money
""
no that's a fact you ask mister sim how he get started
""
his father runs a grocery shop alright
""
not many of us have rich fathers alright
""
so let's say you don't go into r and d that's why i have to go away
from my my my my regret
""
uh i guess it's fine now
""
let's say you don't go into r and d okay
""
you spend three years you become five years you'll become a manager
""
by the time you reach thirty your lifestyle goes up
""
hit thirty-five director of company appointed the the g m or
director of company
""
by the time you reach forty you're a heavy weight earning twelve
thousand fifteen thousand a month
""
what have you got
""
nothing basically
""
all you have is your p r
""
when recession comes who do you think the boss will sack first
""
not if you remember nineteen eight-five eighty-six when recession
comes right
""
i believe many there are many of you who have parents who may have
lost the job
""
you will realise that that's all
""
why don't you have the  word   word
 don't  word   word 
""
forget about being kiasu
""
go for the try
""
what's what's the problem
""
your five three to five years you fail go and get a job
""
what's wrong
""
but what you've learnt in r and d is yours
""
nobody will take it from you
""
it's your asset
""
that's what you need
""
after all you know in my my father gave me my education and i
somehow i landed in singapore because of girl
""
and uh later on i ended up a malaysian boy in singapore went into
r and d fumble around here and there
""
and uh with all this knowledge i met a investor
""
so i told him an an idea
""
basically how we got started was this
""
i was running an engineering firm repairing ibm p c's uh ao
general data general mainframes and uh that sort
""
so we're having problems trying to repair all this computers
""
what we buy in the market is scopes a uh something called huntrump
 word  tractor
""
that's a v i trace you know
""
and we have hundreds of boards every month
""
and we got to send the board to the us and that time a pcxt causes
one thousand five hundred bucks per board
""
and you got to pay forty per cent to send it back to the us
""
and it takes you three months to get it back where in singapore i
got to replace the customer immediately
""
so how do you run a company like this
""
and there's no products in the market that can help us to do that
""
so with that kind of problem i got my chief engineer to go out and
start the company making test equipment that will solve this type of problem
""
so we got an investor to back us up and we started with a ten
square feet room three person
""
that other person employed engineer left us after one month
because he felt that we have no prospect
""
so left two of us
""
so everything was handmade we called it rolls royce alright
everything was hand hand-wired handmade
""
i still have all this in my office you know
""
i can show you very proudly all hand-wired
""
but we did have a product
""
we got to the product was called supercat
""
super because it was super product cat because it was uh
computer-aided tested
""
so we sold that we sold the product and uh the company running for
a million dollars to an australian office
""
we made some money and not a lot and because we we didn't have the
capital so the ninety per cent belongs to the investor
""
so we started another company and this time we were at thinking of
a new product what could come out after supercat
""
you see at that you we had no focus you say what is life after
supercat
""
after producing the product you know like your lexus what is life
after lexus 
""
you know you know that kind of feel
