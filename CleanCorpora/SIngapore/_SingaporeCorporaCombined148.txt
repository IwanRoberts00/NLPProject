this is am singapore with the stories behind this news singapore gets a precinct of five museums and france of his masters in business and engineering good morning i'm peck siok lian a national heritage board will be set up next year to manage a precinct of five museums stretching from the old saint joseph institute to fort canning the five centres include the singapore history museum and a fine art museum to be set up at the old sji and an ancient civilizi civilization museum people's and children museum to be housed in the former tao nan school expected to take twenty years to develop the plans for the museum precinct was announced yesterday by the minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo opening an ex exhibition on gems of chinese art at empress place the minister spoke on the government's attitude towards museums we have not actively promoted the national museum in the past because museums were not high on our scale of national priorities we were more concerned with more basic issues more basic requirements in the past for many years the museum lacks space and expertise and because we did not seem to welcome donations enthusiastically a few singapore collectors chose to give to other countries instead this was a great loss to singapore and i hope this will now change we are now embarked on a program to create more display space and to systematically build up our museum expertise and in the next lap of our national development we must give much more attention to culture and the arts while calling on individuals and corporations to make donations the minister also challenged museum managers to persuade these private collectors and organisations to come forward the modest annual budget the national museum has for acquisitions is hardly enough we'll therefore have to rely heavily on loans and on donations loans can be by private individuals like the word  exhibition which we're opening today all by foreign governments like the tang dynasty exhibition which is now going on at empress place we must also encourage more individuals and corporations to make donations we have received valuable donations in the past but we need much more we need to encourage both singaporeans and non-singaporeans the minister envisioned the museum precinct to be a lively part of the civic district he outlined the challenges ahead in achieving this in addition to good curators we need good entrepreneurs who understand what will draw in the crowds we need a whole area of facilities for the young and old for local residents and for visitors for the serious and the not-so-serious we need good restaurants we need good museum shops and in this way we will be better able to recover a part of our operating costs and to make the whole atmosphere a more lively one the minister for information and the arts brigadier-general george yeo with the challenges spelt out for them what action are our local museum managers likely to take shirley loo-lim is deputy director of the national museum she told shanji dabaracharji that although it's possible to recover part of the museum's operating costs they'll never be self-sufficient the revenue generated will never never be sufficient to support uh all these museums uh earlier on we were saying that all museums in the world are dependent on their respective governments for funding for support there isn't a museum in the world that is totally self-sufficient perhaps there is one in switzerland i believe and that is the transport museum uh but then that museum is totally supported by a very very wealthy individual whose passion is to uh have a a communications museum so that's a separate issue alright but other national museums around the world are very dependent on the state for funding support so you don't anticipate our museums national museum and the empress place museum to become commercially viable independent of government support it will continue to be dependent for government support because i would say about seventy percent of the expenditure would go towards collections' care we have to conserve and preserve the collections we have to maintain we have to have the right environmental standards and controls so these are expensive now the minister has also set down the challenge to the museums in terms of its expertise he's mentioned that the curatorial expertise should be improved and that we should have some entrepreneurial skills also you see coming into the museums correct correct yes how do you entrepreneurial in the sense of uh uh going into some business activities for example uh we plan to start museum shops museum gift shops if you were to visit other museums in europe and in the united states invariably there is the museum gift shop you know and the purpose of this museum gift shop is to retail heritage-based products in other words out of the collections that the museum has we will manufacture things based on our collections for sale not only on the retail basis but also on the wholesale basis we hope we hope well at the moment national museum does not follow up on this trend uh when do you see this actually coming about well we are in fact renovating a corner shop at at armenian street can i leave some surprises up my sleeves because if i tell you everything that we are going to manufacture it might affect our competitive edge you know another another challenge thrown open by the minister was in the sourcing of donations from individuals and corporations how do hope to go about uh achieving this we hope to set up an endowment fund uh when we say donations by corporations and by individuals we don't confine just to to cash donations we are thinking in terms of uh private collectors who have their own private collections of treasures whether they are ceramics bronzes paintings whether chinese paintings contemporary art uh artifacts that private collectors themselves treasure and they may want to share their own collections with other singaporeans and our foreign visitors by lending or donating to the national museum for display this is obviously going to be a challenge for for yourself and the empress place museum uh managers because private collectors are reluctant to still to share their pieces with the public i own out you'll have to leave that to us to our discretion alright something that it's best uh not to talk about in public shirley loo-lim deputy director of the national museum holding her cards word her chest there the time now is seven twenty two next looking abroad to the latest in the middle east it's been threatened used as a bargaining chip and nearly caused the end of a long and sweet friendship but the issue of the american loan guarantees to israel appears to have been finally settled as both countries reached a compromise yesterday in return for the us two billion loan to resettle jewish immigrants in the occupied territories israel will word the construction of new settlements but this is only until those already under construction are completed so how significant a compromise is this on the part of israel earlier this morning dr word from the televiv university in israel gave me his assessment well given this reality will the palestinians talk peace with israel in the next round of talks then if israel will continue building in the occupied territories anyway but how will this compromise affect both shamir and sharon in the next elections given that sharon his hardline housing minister vows never to stop israeli settlements dr word from the televiv university if you have a bachelor's degree and looking to get a masters one country you might want to go to is france local graduates with a basic degree can enter the second year of french word word or prestigious universities and get their masters in two years this is just one of the many educational packages offered by representatives of french universities and graduate schools they're here for a three-day seminar that's jointly organised by the french embassy and the ministry of education although a wide spectrum of different disciplines was introduced emphasis was given however given to engineering and business management studies karen won met up with the director of research word he told her that france is no longer a place where one only goes to study arts and design when a student go over to france to do a degree perhaps in business or even in engineering how marketable are their degrees right could you describe in a very practical uhm way what the differences between the french education in terms of like you mentioned engineering and the american university a common concern most locals have about studying in france is the need to master the language  word director of the centre for applied languages doesn't think it'll be an obstacle ya when you talk about perhaps uhm courses like uh designs or art language may not play such an important part but now you're promoting business and engineering courses uhm in such courses language may play a very important part so will foreign students without a strong mastery in the french language be at a disadvantage are there any preparatory courses or some supports um given to foreign students who may not know the french language very well  word on the learning of french if you want to know more about studying in france you can visit the seminar at the relc or call the french embassy the number is 4664866 that's all for am singapore this week tune in again next monday for more

after a four foot drop its weight less than a paper-back novel the company thinks its new micro-tech tool will make it the lead in the market  perhaps its number one position is because of the time and money spent on r and d and knowing what the customer wants david keller is the vice-president and operations manager of the asia-pacific cellular subscriber division at motorola david keller jo: but your handphones do not come cheap this new micro-tech tool costs about five thousand dollars obviously you don't think the price is a factor in customers' consideration for cellular handphones psl: the cellular telecommunications market is a fast growing one in the asia-pacific and with so much development in this area how would manufacturers keep up? david keller gauges the trend in the market jo: what would be your projection for the cellular telecommunications market here perhaps compared with the other countries in the region? i understand that thailand is really fast catching too
