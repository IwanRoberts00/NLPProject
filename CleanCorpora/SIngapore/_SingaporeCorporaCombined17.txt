word word  the motorboard is very good uh expensive uh two thousand word  two uh audio specialist's offering it at two eight five five audio specialist no lah the other time we went for audio word  specialist uh but delphi that one no yes yesterday one is more expensive you know ya they quoted a higher price yesterday that one we were quoted a price of three one uh three one right about three one three four hundred more not worth it not worth it uh i think you can get about two seven uh to two eight two seven to two eight two seven plus a pair of speaker round about three you can get a celestrian uh sl five no lah word  i don't like the sound sound too word  session five uh session five or session not sl six session five word audition  word audition uh session five  word don't have

mandarin   word uhm got to spend around two plus i think your how's your recommendation of that word i wanted to try the rotel you know word  and power although no doubt oh rotel word  no lah i don't think it's no good i don't think the sound is fantastic the sound sticking there no lah  word  no lah no lah  word okay lah but no because it may maybe the rogers was too much for the rotel it doesn't match you know rogers ya ya ya okay okay can't roger but not bad you know for that kind of price she's only paying about eight hundred plus you know less than one thousand you know you get a word and power  word eight thousand a also have uh also highly rated but it's integrated because rotel can be bridge mono you know so that you get two power and one word  if it's a bridge mono you'll pay about possibility you pay no no no the power is about four hundred plus so if you bridge it's about one two which is about same price as physical variety but physical variety got no bridge lah typhoon you
