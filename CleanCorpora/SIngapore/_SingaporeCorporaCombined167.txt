doctor pua who brought the patient bachu miah to you the police officers how many police officers i do not remember you spoke with the police officers yes and what was your conversation with the police officers well the conversation with the police officers yes what did the police officers tell you they just brought the patients to us for examination before interrogation it is a pre statement examination did the officers discuss with you the injuries before you examined the patient no in what language did you speak to the patient mohamed bachu miah in what language did you speak to him i don't remember but i assume it to be english because i do not speak bangladeshi you don't speak bangladeshi did you record on your treatment card what language you spoke to the accused no i don't what questions did you ask the patient i don't exactly remember the conversation but the usual consultation we have with our patients is to ask them what injuries they have how did they sustain those injuries and whether they have any other problems medical problems but i don't remember the exact conversation i had with the patients now did you have any problems in communicating with the patient he is a bangladeshi you don't speak bangladeshi did you have any problems communicating with the patient i don't recall again whether i had any problems but i did manage to get the history now when you were examining the patient who else was in the examination room other than yourself and the patient my nurse my nurse anybody else i don't recall what about the police officer or police officers who brought the patient to you were they also in the room i don't remember please refer to your notes you may have something there we don't write whether the police officers are present during the examination of the injuries not in our notes what about the presence of the nurse is it written in the notes no that is the normal routine all consultation room has a nurse who will help us to fill in forms and how did you do your examination of the patient he came with his clothes on how did you do this examination well we examined them from head to toe complete examination and pay particular attention to injuries that they pointed it out to us during the history are you saying that he was asked to take off his clothes you examined his body his naked body yes doctor i am instructed and i put it to you that the patient never spoke to you because he could not speak english do you understand the question no i don't recall whether he spoke english or in any other language he might have some knowledge of may be malay or a little bit of english i don't remember but usually for any other patients if i can't communicate it's through if they can speak in malay then we get a nurse who can speak malay to translate or through sign language yes witness please confine your answer to this case i don't remember you don't remember whether you could communicate with him i don't remember you did not get any interpreters to communicate with the patient in this case interpreter from any person to interpret to you so that you could communicate with the patient if as you say they only speak bangladeshi then no because i don't think any nurses in the department can speak bangladeshi all right doctor can you look at your medical report paragraph two a healing linear abrasions over right cheek and left cheek both consistent with the history given can you please tell the court how old in your opinion were these injuries how old were the injuries yes it should be about a week at least a week old witness if i suggest to you that these injuries were inflicted on twenty-second january nineteen eighty-eight between three a m to five a m would you agree with that this would be eight days about eight days before you examined the patient it is possible and would you confirm in this court that these injuries two a were consistent with having been caused by scratching on the patient's face with the fingernails of another person yes doctor what about the injuries listed as two b in your report abrasions over the epigastric region of the abdomen and left forearm consistent with blunt injuries yes you told this court they were consistent with injuries sustained by climbing coconut trees now would you agree with me these injuries in the region of the abdomen would be consistent with fisting on the patient's abdomen by a person no these are superficial abrasions on the skin injuries that you would sustain when you scrape your skin against a rough surface and not a fist doctor i am referring to two b abrasions over the epigastric region right yes now did you pay attention to the appearance of this patient when he was brought to you how did he appear to you in other words what was his state your honour i am trying to ask the doctor whether she observed this patient was he looking normal or was he excited he was brought to you and what was your observation of this patient when he was brought to you i don't recall very clearly but i don't remember he was agitated you don't recall but you don't remember can you see your treatment card is there any note made of this observation that he was agitated or not whatever your observations were his general condition was good doctor did you take his blood pressure blood pressure yes it was one hundred and nine over sixty-three millimetres mercury one hundred and nine over sixty-three is that normal yes and what was his pulse rate like did you take it fifty-three per minute and would you describe that as normal yes doctor the average pulse rate is around seventy seventy two isn't it that is just an average heart rate but it is a wide range from fifty to about one hundred depending on your emotional state on your physical fitness for somebody who has been doing manual work i would assume his physical status to be pretty healthy and fit sportsmen have been known to have pulse rate of thirty to forty beats per minute so fifty three beats per minute to me is normal i have no further questions sir i have watched the cross-examination of my learned friend and to the extent of the dialogue they had as to the difficulties in communication i would wish to adopt that part of it i would just like to put in a few more questions of my own doctor pua my clients says he doesn't speak english he has difficulty in communicating in english does he speak not even a word of english yes doctor pua looking at this report i would put it to you that you did not obtain history from my client what do you mean on the record that you have in page forty six can you have a look at page twenty sorry you are looking at a different report yes that is the one who is my client yes now you examined him on the first of february eighty eight at eleven fifty seven hours you put down there he claimed that his right index and middle fingers were bitten by the deceased on twenty first february eighty eight where did i get the history that his right index and middle fingers that's right it's from him so whatever barriers you may have had in communication you managed to overcome and come to this conclusion yes i can't remember how i got the history including that of the road traffic accident doctor pua you mentioned here that the fingers were bitten by the deceased how did you know that the deceased was involved the patient came with an accompanied form where he had to fill in and there is a short little history there can you come to that please can you read out that short little history read out the whole thing on the thirty first of january nineteen eighty-eight at about nine p m subject was arrested at number twenty-six mandai lake road for an offence of murder which was committed on the twenty second of january nineteen eighty eight at jalan kampong chantek please examine subject for old scars injuries and also any fresh injuries as he is about to give a statement to the police under the provisions of section one hundred and twenty two point six c p c he claimed that his fingers were bitten by the deceased and also had a fall in injuring his knees so in fact you were given a preview preliminary instructions brief details yes and basically this was what you have there just this section yes doctor pua phua you were in the company of a person who was apparently a murderer and you were only with a nurse a lady nurse you were conducting an examination on a person who was suspected of being a murderer and you were only in the company of a lady nurse i only remember that there was a nurse because that is routine i don't remember whether there were other people in the room whether it was a lady nurse oh i can't remember whether the nurse was a lady or a male so sorry it was a presumption on my part when i heard the word nurse i presumed a lady in the examination that you made if understand you correctly when you do the examination you examine your patient from head to toe and he is naked correct would the exact procedure be adopted in my client's case yes coming to the injuries marked as two a and two b these were consistent with being bitten about eight or ten days prior to your examination yes and the injury two f these are consistent with a traffic accident in bangladesh in nineteen seventy-six yes that would put them about twelve years old because you examined him in nineteen eighty-eight yes doctor pua did you also observe whether your patient had any mobility in his right arm anything in your card or observation notes yes i did note that his right deltoid muscle this muscle over here is wasted it is wasted yes so there would be an absence of some strength in that arm there would be some absence yes is dexterity also affected not fully because are you talking about like swinging for example like going bowling or climbing coconut trees or anything else yes yes it would be partially affected doctor i would like to take you now to the report where you have put up on bachu miah you have mentioned under two the following injuries were noted a healing linear abrasions over right cheek and left cheek doctor pua from your experience as a medical practitioner a scar i mean if it is a superficial scar how long would it take to heal about a week or so were these scars deep no consistent with a fight yes thank you doctor
