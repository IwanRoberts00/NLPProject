""

""
""
ya i mean people like lining up to buy this buy that get
everything
""
""

""
""

round fighting for your combination and getting you know
""
""

""
what you call that what's the orientation like this year
""
which groups of link
""
""
uh which orientation
""
oh you mean talking for the hopps the jams uh no idea
""
""
nothing interesting
""
""
can find out lah
""
i got lot of friends who happen to be there
""
""
how's stanley
""
""
so are you going are you going anywhere today
""
""
ya where were we
""
""
like uhm
""
""
what you're doing today
""
""
uhm i got to go for soccer game at i got a soccer training
session at three o'clock
""
""
uh where
""
victoria ah
""
""
ya that's right
""
our boys would be down there about three-thirty
""
""
you went to novena already
""
""
ah no
""
""
later
""
""
i doubt if i can make it for today's session
""
""
aiyah how terrible
""
""
and i feel bad also but the thing is uhm we're having a
tournament coming up you see
""
""
is it
""
""
organised by the school of physical education and you know
""
so i was gearing my boys up for the for the championship actually
""
""
so you got chance or not
""
""
well i'll rate our chances as fifty fifty
""
""
i thought it's suppose to be at least semi-finals
""
""
uhm well touch and go but i mean with a bit of luck we may
just you know even clinch the title actually
""
""
you're suppose to ah
""
how many years already
""
to date this alternate year suppose to win
""
""
ya we have but uhm a group and a bunch of dedicated boys you
know committed
""
""
what about their coach
""
""
well uhm
""
""
tell me more about him lah the coach
""
""
well what can i say
""
i mean you know with that kind of bunch of kids that you have you
know
""
""
is he a good coach or not
""
""
and the kind of enthusiasm that they have been showing and
training you know
""
i think that's enough to carry me and get me going carrying on
with what the job you see
""
""
so you saying the coach is not doing much lah
""
the boys are helping themselves
""
""
no i'm i'm sure the boy it's the boys who are going to be out
in the field to play ultimately and the and the coach get only do that much
""
fine i i feel deep down you know uhm that i've been quite
inspirational and in a sense also been uhm very supportive the boys you know
""
and they look up to me that sense you know
""
""
as a friend rather than a
""
""
as a friend and also like a an older brother you see
""
""
so
""
""
and that's the interesting about teaching you know which i
really enjoy because i realise that you know teaching is not just what goes
round within the perimeters of a classroom
""
it extends beyond those boundaries
""
and just as much as you are learning so much about the students
you are also learning so much about yourself
""
""
true true
""
""
see and i really enjoy what i am doing actually
""
""
uhm so shiok lah
""
i then your speech how's your so how does your speech go
""
""
oh ya
""
""
tell me
""
i never heard your speech
""
you're supposed let me hear how it goes
""
""
what what's there to say
""
but anyway next saturday by the way uhm the school'll be having a
speech day and the minister of education lee yoke suan will be down and there
is a strong probability that i am i have important uh official announcement
will be made with regards to independ with regards to autonomous schools and
and there's a strong chance in fact in fact highly probable that victoria
will be one of the schools going autonomous you see
""
""
what's auto what the difference between autonomous and
independent
""
""
autonomous are so call what they claim to be uh quality
education at a low cost
""
but we're not really independent in the true sense of the word but
we do have certain uhm leeway on the part of our principal you know
""
""
planning and hiring
""
""
like like the choice of teachers whom he wants to come over
to our school and in terms of you know using funds because we would be given
a grant of some seven hundred thousand dollars and you know
""
""
not bad
""
that doesn't mean you can get pay rise lah
""
""
no not really pay pay rise because we still part and parcel
of the ministry of education still you see
""
we're still under them but in terms of having uh electives being
offered to students and we can sort of conduct some of our own programmes you
see
""
so in that sense 
""
""
ri independent ah
