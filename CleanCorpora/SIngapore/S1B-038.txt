the telecom share offer
""
at two dollars a share its total value is a staggering thirty point
five billion dollars
""
that's more than twice the value of the all time favourite singapore
airlines
""
so just how can you make the most of this offer
""
or to discuss this i have in the studio t k yap director of
peregrine securities and fong pui leng investment analyst of r h b cathay
research
""
thank you for joining me this evening
""
now two dollars a share is this reasonable
""
""
yes certainly
""
i think if you look at their p es twenty-seven times p e uhm by it
all judgements uhm it is within the range of expectations the market was
looking for a launch of uhm something even above thirty times p e
""
""
do you agree with that
""
""
yes i do agree it is reasonable
""
i mean it's very much i mean the offer of valuation is very much in
line with uh the world market valuation of telcos
""
uh i mean telecommunication companies uh though it is on the high
end of the twenty-two twenty-nine times uh p e range that the all these
telcos are trading at
""
""
okay now for the singaporean investor who's eligible for all
three categories a b and c what strategy do you think they should take t k
""
""
well obviously uhm category a group group a shares are now uh
uh good value
""
i will suggest this uhm going for the maximum number of shares one
is entitled to under a and and for c the number of shares one would apply for
would depends on one's uh financial background
""
""
okay now and group c is the main question is what to bid
""
what should people be bidding for group c
""
""
well uhm even though it's at a high end of the uh i mean the
range that the uh world type communication companies are trading at i'd say
there's still a lot of upside uh given that you know the market condition
here is a bit different
""
we have very low interest rate very mild inflation and there's a
lot of liquidity in the market
""
uhm my gut feeling is that it can trade more than thirty times p e
up to probably thirty-seven times
""
they will put the evaluation at the two-sixty per share
""
""
two-sixty a share
""
""
well let's say i think if you look at forty times p e uhm
three dollars that's what the market has been talking about that's what the
expectations have been
""
for foreign investors who want the stock they have to bid and they
would put up the price
""
so therefore you do want the share you have no choice but to join
the bidding process not not very different from the way the c o es have
worked and it really comes down to whether you want the share and how bad you
want it
""
uhm telecom issue adds about thirty billion to the market
capitalisation institutions will have to increase weightage if those are
tracking the market on the market cap basis in the region and so for that
reason either they buy the other shares in singapore or they put in the bids
for telecom
""
""
so you've talked about foreign interests what do you expect
foreign institutions to be bidding
""
""
i would say that uh they would bid in excess of three dollars
that's just the general feel that's been going around the market today
""
uhm they obviously feel that the premium would be worth paying for
uhm but the there is quite a wide diversity of views amongst foreign
institutions
""
""
okay now what about the upside potential in the shorter term
couple of weeks what do you expect uhm trading to open november first
""
""
uh that's a very difficult question to answer if you can tell
me how how the market will be trading by then
""
i would the market uh perhaps can be looked upon as being supported
by a base of fundamentals and on top of that you have two pillars one's
liquidity and one's market sentiment
""
if sentiment excuse me remains liquidity is there
""
i think you're gonna see uhm a very very firm opening price in
excess of the cut off price by then
""
""
what do you say what will the price be in november first
""
""
well uh matters  word  by t k say to the
lot depends on the market condition there
""
uh i think it will still be very firm this sentiment in the market
uhm i won't be surprise if it opens at uh above the two sixty
""
i mean given that there's a lot of interest among the uh oversea i
mean as well as the local fund managers uh in this issue i mean is is going
to be a real heavy weight of i mean singapore telecom listing uh it's going
to raise the market cap by about twenty per cent to account for about sixteen
per cent
""
i mean it's something that you know they could not miss out on if
they were to uh be i mean their portfolio were to invest in singapore stock i
think they they will come in you know uh drive the share price up by bidding
it at a higher price to make sure that they do get a portion of the uh offer
""
""
how much how much will they bid
""
""
probably three dollars
""
""
okay now are you as optimistic in the longer term for
singapore telecom share prices
""
""
i would say in the longer term a number of different factors
will come in uhm one obviously would be how the global environment changes
given that the  word  singapore telecom in intends to move
uhm towards the global arena uh deregulation changes a lot of caveats uhm so
at this point in time uh the bet one has to make is whether the match will be
able to sustain the continued growth
""
now thirteen per cent is i think uhm what would be towards the
longer end of general market expectations although most do feel that sixteen
fifteen per cent uh for ninety-three is what uh telecoms will be able to
comfortably deliver
""
""
okay we'll be discussing more about longer term growth later
""
well if you stay on the short-term outlook for the telecom share
issue we'll take a break now when we come back find out if singapore telecom
can deliver in the longer term
""
""
pui leng t k a small and fast maturing market at home and
question marks at the end of the monopoly
""
can singapore telecom maintain double digit growth pu leng
""
""
well as i've said uh well i've heard the singapore telecoms uh
is still faced with very bright prospect well let's say with the home front
""
uh if you're merely talking about just connecting lines to new
subscribers well i should say the singapore telecoms has done a very good job
uh we have what two to three one in two to three uh people having a a
telephone line
""
uh but then if you were to look at uhm i mean if we're to compare
it with let say the more advanced country like the states u k japan uh we
still have a lot of room to grow
""
but i i felt the for the domestic side of the business uh for
singapore telecom the greater growth potential will lies in more providing
more enhance services like probably dial-up uh videos and information
retrieval uh which is becoming uh a i mean a reality with the increase use of
optical fibres
""
so i said at the home front there'll still be a lot of growth
potential of course in the medium term uh well the growth to account from you
know rising international calls uhm increasing use of uhm you know uhm mobile
phones with increasing mobility of people as well as uh increase data
communication traffic
""
""
what about after the monopoly ends
""
""
well after the monopoly ends uh i think singapore uh telecom
will still be the main provider uh
""
it's difficult uh for you know another operator to duplicate the
massive infra-structure that uh singapore telecom has uh invested in
""
it would take a bit of uh time
""
""
t k double digit growth
""
""
well i think that's certainly possible
""
they were in  word  one wants to make big money
or any stock uh you have to take bets and big bets
""
these bets will centre around the quality of management and the bet
is that the management will continue uh to be very profit driven generate a
lot of extra business
""
and the case of s i a we've seen that being done extremely
successfully
""
now in the case of singapore telecom uh it will take time uh for
them to be able to demonstrate that growth
""
at this point in time i think the bet that one has to take is that
the management uh will have enough drive uh to ensure that the double gi
digit continues to to come through
""
now judging on the past track record it seems that there's no
reason to doubt that it would not be able to but uh the asian pacific region
is extremely fast growing region that means hea very heavy competition
""
at the end of the day uh the competition is going to come from
people who see the same opportunities
""
""
okay what about overseas expansion singapore telecom are
relying a lot on that
""
where's that going to
""
""
well any overseas venture is gonna have to take time to
nurture and mature so i think uh you're really looking for cash cow 
word  domestic business to feed the growth in the overseas
expansion
""
how well you manage that growth and how well you cultivate it uh
would determine how well those overseas opportunities are turned into cash
cows
""
""
so very iffy
""
""
it is very iffy because uh it really depends on one two years
from now how may deals telecom will land uh one two years from now what the
cash flow and the profitability of those ventures are gonna be like
""
uhm obviously there will be a learning process
""
""
okay what a what about long term for the singapore telecom
share price what are gonna be the critical factors for its continued growth
""
""
from a point of view of the foreign investors uhm the asia
pacific region holds tremendous growth potential
""
they therefore would be looking at the individual
telecommunications place in the different markets p l d in phillipines for
example hong kong telecom on hong kong market malaysian telecom uh in in
malaysia uh
""
as far as the growth potential is concerned uhm many of these i
think would be looking to expand outside the domestic market on top of the
growth they can see their own domestic markets
""
""
in ten years singapore telecom will be at will it be ten
fifteen dollars
""
""
i think there's every possibility you could see that
""
but for that to continue every growth company continues to evolve
continues to develop and for that to happen uh we certainly would need to see
singapore telecom continue to land major projects major deals
""
uh that will increase profitability significantly
""
""
do you see singapore telecom ten years ten dollars
""
""
well is this possible
""
i mean there's a possibility always uhm well longer-term growth
will be from their globalisation drive
""
i mean they have invested quite a lot in their overseas ventures
and i expect this uh to be uh paying back in in by the end of this decade and
it would be very significant when the pay back comes in
""
""
okay what impact is singapore telecom issue gonna to have on
the local market
""
""
uh well as we have seen you know by today's market well it uh
sort of uh you know drive up i mean uh uh interest in the singapore uh market
""
""
will it increase the price of other g l cs t k 
""
""
possibly i think there're two ways to look at that one is
that singapore telecom is a fairly large-sized market kept stock uh for that
reason investor who invest in singapore on the basis of market capitalisation
within the reason within the region will have to increase weightage in
singapore they do that by buying the other uh proxies of the singapore market
or they can buy singapore tel  word  telecom directly for
that reason i think a number  word  of them would go on to
bid fairly aggressively to lock in a fair amount of shares in initial process
of tender for the c shares
""
""
okay well thank you very much we've run out of time thank you
very much for joining me on moneymind tonight well if you're all excited
about the singapore telecom share offer it opens tomorrow and you have until
