now i'll fill you on with uhm the addition reactions well you addition reactions are not typical reactions of aromatic compounds that or you have seen so uhm addition reactions are not the typical reactions of aromatic compounds uh but of the three five methods hetrocyclic compounds furan uhm thiophen and pyrrole i have pointed out to you that furan is of the lowest uh aromaticity it's the least aromatic of the three so you find that there are efficient reactions taking place in furan alright and this is because of its low aromatic character and uhm and indicates that furan tends to behave like a diene alright that's when it's not behaving like an aromatic compound alright this is furan uhm both of their electrons are opposed donated they are donated to the ring system in order that the compound possess six pie electrons alright required by aromatic sets word you note that if you mix these whole word the subsequent kenonical structures would have a positive charge on oxygen right which is not favourable for furan so because of that furan would rather not have alright the charge oxygen right it would tend to remain in its neutral form alright and in this way it will behave like a diene alright this is the diene component now there are many examples of furan behaving as a diene chemically uhm these are some of them can you see is it too light is it can you see from behind you can't ah would it help if i turn off the light right right so we have first of all the nitration of furan the nitration of furan uhm nitration is carried out using what is this reagent uhm ee lee it's the usual nitrating reagent for the hetrocyclic compound chek yu ahum tin wee this is the nitronium acetate nitronium acetate acetile nitrate alright quite close alright acetile nitrate and it is uhm nitrating agent for all these five hetrocycles because for what reason ming seng because it is weakly acidic alright you cannot afford to use uhm nitric acid word nitric acid and sulphuric acid for the nitration reactions so acetile nitrate is used because of its low acidity right so what do we have uhm now you find that for furan reaction with acetyl nitrate does not give them nitrofuran as expected instead the product of reaction is a two five adduct right having the structure so you see this is the nitronium ion that was originally added on alright and you find that there is a acetyl word that is attached onto the other terminal carbon which came from the acetate and ion alright there is a two five adduct that is formed this two five adduct is not very stable and on uh treatment and on heating or pyridine treatment with pyridine the acetyl word  is lost as acidic acid and this will regenerate nitrofuran right which is the product that one expects first now why is it that the reaction follows this rather odd course observed here now the mechanism of the reaction is shown well initially there would be an addition of the nitronium ion right like in the in this manner uh something that you are familiar with the charge alright would be delocalised the positive charge would be delocalised on this carbon this carbon and then on the oxygen which we know is of lowest stability because of the charge of oxygen now remember that when the nitronium ion goes and attack the carbon there is still the acetate that remains behind and the acetate and ion can act as a nucleophile alright so it will attack the positive centre on the carbon on a nucleus well this may not be sterically favourable alright this position may not be sterically favourable this one further away from the nitro would be more suitable and this is what happens the acetate then goes in into this position and you have your adduct formed alright in this way right so we have the nitronium ion and uhm this way in another words there are two alternative pathways which this nitronium which this cat-ion can go the first would be the usual elimination of h plus this will give you the substitution product alright uh the cost of react for thiophen and pyrrole this is the normal course of reaction alright the normal course but you find that there's an alternative process which is reaction with c-h-2 the nucleophile so the h does not get lost right this is the alternative alternative pathway now which of these paths or rather the choice of uhm which pathway would be followed is dependent upon the activation energies of each step depends on the relative activation energies of each step alright for this it would be the activation energy for the loss of proton alright and for this it would be the activation energy for the reaction with acetate now if the compound the resulting compound has got good aromatic character in it the activation energy for the protonation would also be low alright would be low if there is aromatic character well developed in the final product then the activation energy for loss of proton would be small alright but in the case of furan since aromatic character is poorly developed this is of low aromaticity the deprotonation energy would be higher than as compared to the deprotonation energy for the corresponding thiophen or pyrrole derivative alright so this pathway becomes an attractive alternative alright so that because of it the reaction is directed along this course rather than above but for the rest you find that if this is s alright or if it is n-h alright thiophen or pyrrole actually these two alternatives also exist that means it can go like that or by this way but you find that this pathway hardly takes place at all because the activation energy for loss of proton is very small and why is it small it's because aromatic character is well developed in the final product alright so it never even looks at this pathway it is directed along this direction in this direction so because of this ah for furan you do not have a straightforward substitution alright of h like n-o-2 but there is an addition by the acetate and ion to give rise to the two five adduct alright which is not stable so you do get back the product that uh one sets out to obtain the two nitrofuran by treatment of heat alright or uh by heat treatment or treatment with pyridine alright that will eliminate the acetate and give rise to the product okay right so that's for the nitration of furan now there could be other reagents used in place of acetyl nitrate uh reagents which contain a nitronium cat-ion and which are also weakly acidic one example is nitronium etrafluoroborate this alright nitronium tetrafluoroborate now when nitration is carried out using this particular reagent there is no adduct formed that means that it gives rise to a straightforward addition you get this immediately alright and you may wonder what happen to the bf4 minus why is it it doesn't add on to the positive centre to the ring the reason is that the bf4 minus is not a nucleophille alright it is not a nucleophile if you look at it carefully you will see that its valence is already saturated alright the boron atom cannot form an additional bond so it cannot it will not react with the current the positively charged carbon because its valence is already satisfied is completely satisfied alright so you find that when uh nitration is carried out using nitronium tetrafluoroborate you won't have this form alright you'll have the addition of the ni the nitronium cat-ion and then this will not take place the elimination of h will then occur and the nitrofuran is obtained alright so that is uh so must watch out you must watch out for the type of reagent that is used alright for the reaction now another example of an addition reaction of furan is the bromination is uh the bromination reaction now bromination uhm is usually not a very useful electrophilic substitution reaction because it tends to give rise to polyhalogenated compounds right the halogen enters at more than uh one position so it's uh unless you are looking for a multi-substituted product but if you want to have a monosubstituted product uhm in order for the reaction to be useful it must be conducted at low temperatures right low temperatures now this is an example the bromination of furan there's a bromonium electrophile the bromonium cat-ion which is the electrophile the reaction is carried out in the solvent methadol and at minus ten degrees centigrade now not uhm the products formed well not a-s a single product is not formed from this reaction alright you find that there are three products produced this is the expected product of electrophilic substitution alright now how did this come about by the following mechanism the same as the above alright there is a dis delocalisation of the positive charge there's methocide and ion which is the nucleophile comes from the solvent methanol alright so the methadol will produce the methocide and ion which will act as a nucleophile and attack the ring alright so you'll find that that is how the first product is uh formed and the second the third product that is shown uh it is produced by the displacement of b-r minus by c-h-3-o minus by the methocide and ion alright loss of p-r minus the halogens are good leaving groups so it is displaced and then you have it alright a diene methocine adduct alright so you find that uhm the hydrogen atoms here are quite resistant alright to displacement because they are not so uh they are not as good leave they are not word leaving groups as compared to bromine alright so uh these products are imitative of an addition reaction taking place in furan right now the last example of an addition reaction is that of a cycloaddition process and the name of this reaction is called is the dielsalder reaction now the diels-alder reaction refers to addition reactions of dienes alright you have a diene here now dienes will react with certain reagents uhm which are called dienophile actually the name is not very doesn't convey to you very much information because the dienophile is just a compound that likes a diene alright dienophile alright like hydrophilic right that uh p-h-i-l-e indicates it likes a diene so uhm a number various types of reagents can uhm act in this capacity as dienophile a common example a good example is maleic anhydride alright so when you have diene and maleic anhydride addition takes place to give rise to an adduct the product is just called an adduct or a diels-alder al a diels-alder adduct alright now if you look at it carefully you will see that this portion represents the original diene right this portion is the original diene addition has taking has taken place evolving the double bond right the double bond of maleic anhydride has disappeared alright so you find these are the new bonds that are created alright since addition occurs the two double bonds of diene cannot no long can no longer exist it is now reduced to one and this is the remaining double bond alright so can you see this is the original diene and this is maleic anhydride component alright with the double bond uhm saturated now furan has been noted to act like a diene it can react with maleic anhydride so you find that the same thing addition across the double bond of uh maleic anhydride produces an adduct now there are two confirmations of this adduct one an exo and the other one endo alright  exo is when the well the furan ring or what remains of it is orientated at a different plane from the maleic anhydride alright so these dash lines indicates that it's going down below the plane and the bold lines it is above the plane so that is endo alright the endo product is formed more rapidly it is a kinetic but it is not the most stable subsequent rearrangement will take place to give rise to the exo adduct note the orientation of these two wings alright now at the same direction this one is the thermodynamic product alright so this is an example have you do you remember examples of uh reactions under thermodynamic and kinetic control uuh one that i mention some time ago the sulfunation of kuinonine alright you find that that is also under kinetic and thermodynamic control alright so uhm the cycloaddition alright which is an indication that furan has diene-like character alright uh another thing that one could also add to the list of uhm properties you know like uh furan indicating its diene-like properties it's the electrophilic substitution of furan uh in particular the orientation of the incoming electrophile alright do you remember that part of it alright you had furan alright and you find that you have a substituent and i mention that uh for all the other hetrocycles where the electrophile enters will depend on what this x is whether it's electron donating or electron withdrawing right does that do you remember that but you find that in the case of furan it doesn't matter what x is the two x alright at the two position it can be electron donating or electron withdrawing but the electrophile is always directed to the other kerminal carbon alright position five alright and the reason why this is uh so well it is a reflection of its diene-like character alright i talk about the stabilisation of the carbonium ions and so forth alright supposing it goes here you find that there is limited stabilisation of the charge of the positive charge if it goes into this direction you find that it's more the localisation of charge alright so uh this is one point to take note of right can add can be added to the list alright of uhm uh chemical evidence of the low aromatic character of furan right now so having done with uh electrophilic substitution reactions and addition reactions we will now move on to nucleophilic reactions
