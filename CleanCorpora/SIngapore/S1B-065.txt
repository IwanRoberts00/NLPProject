curb around the vicinity

""
no my lord
""
""
i have only one last question

i will leave it to your lordship to decide it if i am allowed to
ask

i will ask because he may not be an expert
""
i will ask him if your lordship would allow me
""
you have investigated many of these accidents
""
""
yes my lord

and if a vehicle travel at about forty kilometres even if
there was some swerving action if he did turn right would he end up in that
position with an overturned vehicle shown in the photographs
