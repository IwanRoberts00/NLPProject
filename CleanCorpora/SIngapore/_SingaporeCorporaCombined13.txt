ya so you're saying about the d and d how what's your response according to michelle uhm about eight eight tables uh you know kee min or michelle ha they manage to get so many ya not not too bad oh and then uh they were saying that uhm only the comp centre staff will get prizes the lucky draw word  oh again the rest all won't be getting so they say it's about half so that means they bought about twen twenty plus twenty plus prize uh so about fifty percent chance uh yes whoa not bad not bad nuh uhm but i don't know what's the prize like uhm first prize is a mini compo mini compo ah that usually costs about three hundred plus three hundred plus uh uhm whoa not bad nuh a much much much more than what what we have for the first prize last time ya because this year the subsidy has gone up from two to four dollars oh yeh ya two to four dollars ya very good uh no what twenty four dollars what ya times two this year they double it up oh so this year is forty eight oh uhm then the what leh what is that uh the second prize is what don't know uh second prize not not interesting second there're twen there're twenty over prize is starting from one to twenty ah how about table table games and word  prize like this uhm word  i heard dbc is coming you know dbc coming here no coming for our d and d oh maybe he's the guest-of-honour ah that's why he's the guest-of-honour that's why everybody say must be there at least before seven thirty mr huang something or dr huang uh oh dr huang uhm i think so that's why i was i was trying to ask michelle who was the guest-of-honour who is going to be then aiyah forgot oh i see i heard i heard from bee guan then uh but you are going right uhm ya because i word  bee guan whether the ad and the director whether they're forming a table ah so she say 'oh maybe because the dbc is coming and then some other people are coming also' so that's why the management side is okay lah no problem so maybe the word  in that case word  but ravi is not going ravi is not going uh how come don't know that's what i heard i was thinking whoa the whole group of them will be going uh but it seems not then kee min keep on pestering me pestering you uh ya she said come uh very good fun actually you can go right because very difficult anyway your children are free also what ya but aiyah have to look after them then too too late already word  maybe you bring one instead of two lah then the other one your uhm can look after then after that you still have to rush back or no point then that that night don't bring him lor cannot nuh i find it's very bad it's okay lah it's once in a while aiyah don't know lah sometimes those relative wedding dinner uhm after that i've to rush all the way there oh rush back to fetch them ya uhm so tomorrow let me

and daughter lor oh is it ya oh he has three uh three three children altogether  word i thought it's two no then mrs tan is likely bringing her daughter daughter i heard mrs wong wanted to bring her three daughters three three children whoa that's good you know how much they are paid three hundred ha so expensive uh three hundred for what per couple uh don't know uh i think three hundred lah uhm doesn't matter how many you bring oh for dr teo lah oh doesn't matter so no wonder they're bringing so many their children nah three hundred for whoa three hundred quite a lot you know previously was how much uh previously looks like two hundred and forty uh but for two is it two word  whoa that means this round is the previous round was more expensive ya lah if you are you count by the number of people that means they're it's actually hundred and twenty ya then this who leh uhm mrs lim they all leh don't know word  oh because at the time when i asked kee min he was not sure ya amys are paying sixty right bee guan also paying sixty  word because they're they count by their  word  so eileen going uh eileen no lah aiyah that means you and then chay hoon susan ya lor eight of us then just now i told bee guan that uh eileen is not going so she asked word to have this chee wha lor to join us  word asked her husband you know  word she it seems that she's not coming with us do you see yen jing nowadays once in a while very slim ya lor slimmed down already uhm so fast uh actually that time she called up chin hwa during her maternity leave she told me say whoa the baby uh make her lost five

performance right don't know not not too sure uhm uhm i wonder who will get first prize ya lor last the last time sandra got it sandra uh uhm ha no no no word  what word was what also a mini compo no lah that time was very cheap ya i think uhm it's a is it mini compo it's not a mini compo mini compo is usually those with cd player right ya those those small word  not carry compo i think cos i think it's a bit word carry compo oh those kind word  but that one i think it it's not doesn't cost as much as three hundred plus maybe the most is hundred plus word  whoa this year the first prize very good ya but it seems that they can get cheaper electrical goods right ya from jeremy's friend oh oh that one is his friend nuh ah a lot of gifts idea so next time if you want to give get any gift ask him  word  then ah his friend shop is at i think macpherson uh oh uhm but then if you if you go without his recommendation you won't get the discount also no but but maybe ask him to call up his friend say who and who you see oh or mention his name then the friend always gives discounts then he said do all the losing business not really what maybe the only thing profit that he earn a bit less
