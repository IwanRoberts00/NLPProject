sex yes s e x some people say there's too much sex on the singapore stage too much of a bad thing other say you ain't seen nothing yet there's not enough of the good thing but there are a few critics who go so far to say that the over-indulgence is tainting singapore theatre before we hear our studio guest let's watch a video clip of recent productions so be comfortable and breathe normally i got to check my pulse rate how's yours well was that interesting disgusting or you may be thinking what's the big deal maybe i'll start with you keng sen what's the big deal is there really too much sex on singapore stage well i think that uh i mean i've been looking at the at the clips right and two of the plays were directed by myself that's why that's why we brought you here yah and uhm i suppose i'm more incline to what's the big deal because i feel that uh at this moment singaporean theatre is still exploring you know so it's really of a a virgin i mean we are we are uhm we've been doing singlish in singaporean theatre for the last uh five six years in a very intense way uhm and if we start dictating right now what to write to the playwright i think that we are self-censoring to your word but the question is why exploring just the sexual themes there are so many other things i think that then it must be important enough to the playwrights you see because maybe sexuality is an important concern uh for many young people because they they see that uh as a a as an identity uh as a a a a a a a way in which they can talk about other themes for instance oh let's check with the playwright is that true well i was first of all going to say that i dispute the fact that there's a over-indulgence in of course you're a lawyer right and i feel i can martial some facts to to back it up okay let's have some facts i think that if you really look at the number of plays that had been put up over the past three or four years uhm in the course of which goes you know four or five clips were were chosen and uh presented to you in you know close proximity wow sex sex sex i think in between all of these plays you'll find that there were many other plays perhaps uhm not evoking so much media interest uh which dealt with quite apart from sex the the the point we need to address is not not merely a question of uhm whether we should be self-censoring whether in fact when people take issue with playwrights who write controversial plays then in fact this is a call for more conservatives uh theatre i don't think that is that is the demand of a great many people i think a nude body on stage does does not in itself constitute uhm a sexist gesture i think what what needs to be analysed is is really the question of what use it's made of the body uhm some ways that is where the problem lies you see okay how do we make use of sexual expression i feel that right now most writers are really with because at one stage singaporean writing was not honest and we wanted singaporean writing to be honest so we told the playwright is the honesty is the sex uh equate with honesty it's one part of honesty i think you know okay you agree with that sanjay well i think i think to a very large extent that's true although my concern here is also to want to push push the argument a little further i think there's a complex uhm situation here because on the one hand you have people who are in fact dealing with questions that are very close to their hearts and i think this is valid this is legitimate this is very important in fact but on the other hand i think one of the things that uhm we need to begin to address is also the question of how the question of sex or more importantly sexuality begins to actually move into into into into larger questions largely social questions as well and in in in in some ways for me that is where the challenge of singapore theatre lies sorry sanjay i have to interrupt you here for a short break we get back to you stay tune we'll be back welcome back thank you for staying tune in now let get back to sanjay you were saying uhm i'm thinking also of the the problem in in recent place where the question of censorship becomes a very central problem uhm and it seems to me uhm that you know you have on the one hand a liberal sort of uhm avant-garde uhm artiste uhm our artistic avant-garde against the conservative establishment and you know what happens in this debate is uh you feel the divide uhm i think definitely are you avant-garde there's divide there's divide i don't think there is so much avant-garde but i think that the problem right now is that singaporean society is so reactionary you see i feel i feel that artiste just need to have some leeway to explore to explore issues but as soon as issues are explored there is a big hue and cry and suddenly it explodes in our faces into something which which very soon i think laws and regulations will be created to blunt us this this is my point as well you see my point is also that if or if if there is if the debate is structured in these terms then then it becomes a case where you are you have an either or situation if you are if you are critical of of of sex and the arts then you are necessarily you know pushed into the camp of of the conservatives i think it's important to see uhm that in the long run surely you don't believe that do you no to a very large extent that becomes that becomes how the argument is is structured you see if you are against sex then you are also then you are necessarily a conservative i think it's important to see that you know one has to be against the censorship one has to say that in fact we have to open up other possibilities of discussion while at the same time remaining very clear about the kinds of directions we would like to go towards that the reason that is that is censorship is not the issue you know is there too much sex yes it is it is the issue censorship is very much central it becomes an issue in this word  let me give you an example of this the censors haven't said anything yet it's the it's the audience who parts of the audience who are reacting but you see the word the the interesting uh fact is that uh like lady of soul despite uh a big hue and cry it was sold out and denied and people were flocking to watch it and we had to extend this etceteras etceteras so there is obviously so to me there's there's a a hypocrisy really because there's there's a demand but yet the we get a a big hue and cry about uh uh lady of soul you see i'm glad you brought up the example of the lady of soul ken san i mean i think it's an extremely interesting play but uhm my own feelings about having read the play is is is is basically that uhm the playwright himself found you read the play or you saw the play i read the play unfortunate didn't see the production couldn't get tickets it was sold out uhm but what what is most what is most what is most interesting cliche is it what is most interesting about it was uhm that censorship became the subtext of this play it became an attempt to see how far you could push uhm the limits of was there any objective legitimate not necessarily as the director i think i feel not necessarily as a director but i think that un unfortunately or fortunately the play confronts the censorship head on you see because of uh the issues in it and because of certain uh certain pieces of uh of of writing so definitely the the censorship board had to had to decide whether or not it was going to pass this play and in fact it came back at first uh uh with lots of cuts and subsequently because of the the of the censorship review committee and changes made to the laws uh the play was allowed to be passed so inevitably i think that you within this society because it's so reactionary anything which is uhm out of the norm is immediately questioned through censorship i think this is this is really the point you know i mean the the problem is that playwrights can very often be forced into a position where they feel that you know the issue is censorship the danger with this for me is that freedom the freedom of speech becomes seen as an end in itself this is a problem because censorship is a very important problem but but i think the practitioner has to begin to recognise also that freedom of speech is only a means to an end i think we have to acknowledge here and and and and trust the people who are who are uhm producing this work uhm creating it that uhm except for perhaps french lunatics most of us are interested in saying something interested in reaching our audience and uhm we we have we have things you want to say whether about sex or about uhm other issues where sex is used as al an analogy to to to highlight certain point whatever it is we we have serious things we do want to say and taking that into consideration this is as this i see this as a process of communication between the audience and yourself to sew how how to come up with that balance or the best way to bring a message across yet keep your audience i mean it's not but who's your audience you you talk about people being reactionary isn't that a bit arrogant on your part i didn't use the word reactionary i used the word reactionary so who's your audience who's your audience i think that the that uh the reactionary people are actually the media because because for me so blame it on your the media well the audience came what media isn't here the audience came watched the show and some wrote back saying that we hatred the show and some wrote back and said we loved the show uh but suddenly before we knew it the next week it was blown up into an issue which uh threatened the whole state of theatre in singapore and that threatened the whole state i mean it was described as threatening the state of theatre and uh that was very interesting for me because and in fact in your opening remarks i think you said it threatened to taint singapore word  some people said it was tainting theatre yes that's right but i think you have used along those lines right sanjay no i i i this's precisely what i do not want to say i mean i think it is important to see that the people who who who have problems with the way in which sex is depicted in some plays are not arguing that in fact the moral fabric of this society is being threatened  they are not arguing that we need more censorship what are they arguing they are arguing
