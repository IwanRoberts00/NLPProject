 address by mr lim soon hock, managing director, asia compaq computer asia pte ltd  mr pro-chancellor graduates ladies and gentlemen it is a privilege for me to address you all today congratulations graduates for many of you today marks the end of your academic careers and i'm sure you have looked forward to this moment with great expectations the degrees you collect today are recognition of what you have accomplished through hard work perseverance and dedication they will prove to the world that you are all trained engineers they look backward at the life you have lead until today and praise you for your accomplishments but they represent something far more important something which looks ahead they prove that you have learned how to learn that in the final analysis is education's greatest gift because in the world outside the comfortable halls of academia it is not what you know but rather what you are able to learn which will make all the difference what lies ahead of you all today is a world which is changing faster and more profoundly than it ever has before it is a world that just a few short years ago was unimaginable who could have imagined a united germany the fall of communism in country after country in eastern europe manned space travel being only page three news or the soviet union looking to the united states and other countries for the financing necessary to move toward a free market economy so if the degrees you receive today are tickets for your journey through this daunting and unpredictable landscape what advice can i lend to help you on your way i think i would start with a strange request i would ask each and every one of you to be unreasonable this must sound strange after you have spent so much time in these halls learning the value of reason honing your skills to become reasoned thinkers and after countless requests from parents and teachers to just be reasonable let me explain george bernard shaw once said the reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man if shaw had been writing today he undoubtedly would have said that progress depends on the unreasonable man or woman and that raises another point about changes in the world around us changing the world is no longer the province of just men what was once patronisingly called the fairer sex has proven that it is often also the smarter and more capable one the proverbial battle of the sexes has broken free of the confines of moonlit nights and candle-lit dinners now it is as frequently waged in boardrooms or from political platforms so why do i ask you men and women to be unreasonable what do i mean by being unreasonable if i place my request in its historical context perhaps it will become clearer the 19th century saw the rapid advancement of civilization first start on a modern scale of pace reach and impact it brought the industrial revolution great strides forward in medicine and the ascendance of science as man's principal tool for unlocking the mysteries of the world around him it was called the age of reason in the 20th century the world first took full advantage of all of these new found tools of reason the pace of change took a huge stride forward two world wars and the terrifying technology of nuclear weapons created a bi-polar political structure which has brought relative stability to world politics for the past 50 years man began the exploration of space information became instantly accessible around the globe when japan declared war against the united states it took two and a half days for the declaration to be formally presented i am told that george bush informed mikhail gorbachev of the us invasion of kuwait within twenty minutes and coverage of that war was seen live on televisions in london living rooms and sarawak longhouses simultaneously we truly have become the products of the information age this overwhelming abundance of and access to information will have a major impact in further shaping the century to come it will be a century which one london business school professor has dubbed the age of unreason this is the century that you inherit the century you will help shape what will it be like i'm sure my imagination could not do it credit but some parts of it are clear technology will bring changes at a faster and faster rate traditional structures and processes of business and society will be replaced over and over again within a decade it has been predicted that eighty percent of all jobs in industrialised nations will call for mental rather than manual skills that seems extremely encouraging for a group of new degree holders but what mental skills will be needed hopefully many of those same skills which you have worked so hard at learning during your years here at university education will have given you the tools you need to confront the change which lies ahead as graduates you represent the top 18% of all students in singapore but your specific training as engineers is only one part of what you will need primary among the broader skills your education has given you will be the ability to adapt and learn to master and in fact help shape change that statement brings me back to my original premise about being unreasonable in this context then being unreasonable means not being content to accept change but rather taking the initiative to shape it as you enter the working world you become a part of the process of change more importantly the significance of the part you play is entirely up to you einstein had three rules of work one out of clutter find simplicity two from discord make harmony three in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity these are simple rules from a very complex man but it is important to note that these rules place the burden squarely on the shoulders of the individual it will be your job to find simplicity and make harmony to rise above difficulty and take advantage of every opportunity you must find it unreasonable to resist change to do it as it has always been done you must find it unreasonable to approach challenges with conventional thought to play conventional roles to be content with the status quo many of you, statistics show that as many as 20 to 30 per cent of you may find your careers leading you away from your training in engineering on the other hand many of you will prosper in your chosen field for years to come either course is fine as long as you refuse to either hide behind complacency or run from adversity the changing future has equal need for the strength and discipline of focused experts and the creativity and daring of entrepreneurs the key is to continue to adapt the world around you on whatever path you choose in the past that world has been adapted by two forces more than any others technology and economics each feeding on and spurring growth in the other the individuals who have made a difference have always understood this link and exploited it to the fullest many of them started as engineers it was reasonable to think that the telegraph transported information quickly and effectively but not to alexander graham bell it was reasonable to be content with gas lighting but not to thomas edison it was reasonable to think that conventional manufacturing techniques produced adequate amounts of goods but not to henry ford the list is a familiar one individuals with vision and an unreasonable desire to reinvent the world around themselves so how do these well-known examples have relevance in today's singapore each of these unreasonable men changed their world they combined technical engineering skills with vision to propel their societies forward and their ideas helped spur enormous economic growth in their countries if we look at today's leading nations each built economic might on the back of technological excellence the united states germany japan engineering and engineers with vision led the way today's singapore provides unlimited opportunities for tomorrow's edisons fords and bells singapore has worked hard to provide an environment which is not limited by its small geographic boundaries our country has succeeded in creating the landscape of a technopolis with worldwide relevance foresight perseverance and hard work have given singapore its much envied infrastructure the hard structures facilities and technologies needed to provide for growth in the 20th century today's great global companies have recognised singapore's importance by establishing themselves here you must match and indeed take advantage of their global vision the opportunities for each and every one of you to expand both your visionary and physical horizons are better than they have ever been before it is not unreasonable to think that any of you could find work in one of the world's largest corporations it is not unreasonable to think that the work you do for such a company can effect and change the world for the better it is not unreasonable to expect you to build the soft infrastructure by which i mean the creativity innovativeness technical expertise r&d know how financial acumen marketing prowess and managerial talents which will be needed to continually attract investments into singapore as we grow into the 21st century it may seem unreasonable however for me to make my next request currently only four singapore companies are counted among the worlds top 1,000 i put it to you that you can play a role in seeing that number greatly increase during your lifetimes some among you may become entrepreneurs it will take courage and perseverance to see your personal visions grow and prosper but you must always remember that growth and prosperity are only limited by your ideas by successfully combining your technical training with the business skills which you will develop and hone in your professional careers you can add to that list with a global vision and the opportunities which singapore's technopolis holds out to you you can become masters of change but does this mean you must master change alone does it mean you must discard everything from the past thankfully it does not to face change and become its master you will need firm foundations and anchors your parents the families you yourselves will start your school your cultural traditions and the society around you all will serve as your reservoirs of strength and continuity in the changing world but as much as these represent strength and support you will now begin to see the responsibility they bring with them as well throughout your education you have been able to concentrate on yourselves your test scores your performance and your growing abilities have been your first priority but today represents as much as anything the beginning of a shift in that scale of priorities now begins the process of looking outward of giving back to those people institutions and structures which have given so much to you as you adapt the future never discard the past instead build on it keep up your ties with the university i would urge you all to become active members of the engineering alumni today you have been transformed from your status as students to membership in a much broader fellowship that of graduates as members of this fellowship you have new resources on which to draw and new responsibilities to fulfil if recent statements by our government are anything to go by the alumni will play a greater role in the future development of our university that role is not merely limited to financial support you can contribute by sharing your expertise and the new areas of specialisation which you will find in the professional world with the undergraduates graduates and fellow alumni this type of shared fellowship can foster professionalism create business opportunities and most importantly help the university to become a richer and more lively environment for learning  now you get to change the world it is your job to give shape and meaning to the age of unreason do it with a sense of expectation and possibility do it with enthusiasm do it for both yourself and others and i am confident you will do it well i think, all in all, that is a pretty reasonable request
