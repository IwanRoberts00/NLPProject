and then after there's the tea ceremony that's at your home ya who's that no that's that's someone from geography department so they pang the pang teh would be at about four four pm or four-thirty at my place what's happening to church ceremony are they singing or something they're going to sing then the bride's coming in then they're going to say word  together are they no they don't there's no performance or anything in the church itself the last few weddings i've been to don't know what they're like whose wedding lilian's wedding but no one sang for them yes no they had a duet oh they sang together don't you remember they didn't sing peng ling and her husband sang right ya is that right ya like who or was it that no i i remember peng nan sang for peng nan and the wife as well oh ya ya ya that's true that's nice because they're so sporting but uhm geraldine doesn't want to sing and yen has a a wedding is not the to be sporting that's true and yen is tone deaf also tone deaf oh so he claims so but is anybody in the church singing for them uh no they don't want anything so no one is gonna to do anything i won't be mcing anything at all in the wedding in the church you're definitely not the the bestman there's no bestman and there's no bride's maid either oh doesn't she have a sister or something yes but they don't want bride's maid and best man what's strange also is they want to break tra tradition in so many ways that it's so ridiculous like like what they said that they don't want anyone to stand up when the bride comes in so everyone will be seated when the bride comes in but then you you know unless you specifically tell oh they're no they're gonna specifically tell people that oh because otherwise some will stand up and some would sit down ya so he would say uhm can you please sit down for the bride the bride and groom specifically ask that you sit down for the why uh geraldine said she doesn't want uh whenever people stand up people will be like trying to look at the bride and then a lot of people won't see if you sit down everyone has an equal opportunity to see her anyway so well i suppose there's some logic in there well and then they showed me their wedding photos on last oh well last week and her evening gown she said that she took the best of everything maybe word she went through the whole catalogue then she said i like the bodies of this i like the sleeve of that i like the skirt of that came out looking so terrible oh you seen it it's not she herself even said aiyah now that it's combine it looks very sloppy because if you noticed all that peng ling is so all body hugging right ya ya ya and if you're slim that's quite nice that's okay in it she is slim but her dress came up looking like it's very soft and flowy here it's very soft and flowy below so it becomes so she looks fluffer than she is ah she it looks very wishy-washy you know so it's not nice so what to do but her her wedding gown is quite quite her wedding gown is nice ya it's very nice how how do you know you saw photos i saw when it was hanging in your room for like in a week before you came back in my room ya how come oh her dress was hanging in my room ya her dress was hanging in your room do you think she was hanging in your room no i i thought her photo was hanging there no the the dress is hanging there okay we went went to visit ah ma and then always nosing  word  if i nose into your room just in case you came back you didn't tell me oh the evening gown is the same colour as the wedding gown it's white off-white so it's the same so so you don't like her dress looks not very that did your brother make i'm sure he did he no he didn't make he just bought it ah okay lah just bought ya brown in colour which i didn't think was very appropriate colour brown i thought at least it has to be charcoal blue or something or some or grey or something quite nice eh that's true and you you're making a suit no same stuff one one i already have so what about your mother what is she going to like has she planned something she's deliberating what if she can bruise three days for one two days ya she might wear i don't like that dress what what is that i think it word  what is that it's sort of crushed velvet you know it's not suitable for older people what colour is it uhm terrible looks like a word  it's sort of violet and green it's tight and very short oh short it's not a long dress no it's not long short as in how short well short for me knee okay ya i mean it's short for an older person right so is it grand or what i mean it's i don't like it don't like it i don't like it so tell her not wear but you see i my father of course being the indulgent person he's oh so oh you look young you look young it just because you wear something a young person wears do not make you no no i feel that it's not it's it's quite fun sort of outfit but you know this is the wedding and  word  ya ya ya anyway i i don't i i hope she wears some another one it's black in colour and it's long okay for me at least probably she's she's si kor right oh your brother called last night my mom thought was you for for what call for what i think regarding the car oh ya ya ya he wants to word it so when when are we getting the car friday we'll be sending it over on friday okay ya and then you can decorate it oh geraldine's mother is going to decorate it but uhm we're going to test drive it because the other person has never driven a car that sort of car before it's three fifty or three hundred or five hundred it's just three hundred sdl okay but the l bit makes it a bit harder to drive because it's long oh l it's long ya oh okay okay anyway uhm what was that now my mother not my mother sa khor called up and then to tell me what she's going to wear she said her church wear is gonna be green with gathers here then she said no lah it'll not too much gathers because i don't want it to add to my waist i'll tell there's much more to add into it so she said don't she doesn't want that uh to add to her waist then church no for dinner itself is what is it now oh it's a very nice dress that you can i can imagine her fingers going why was she ringing up to tell you something like that no i was talking about a lot of things oh a lot of things and this was just part of the conversation so and you say you gonna wear black i don't know i was i feel it's too formal very lau very lau you know in in singapore no it's here but it's black velvet and it's off no no no wear that it'll be nice but i know what you singaporeans don't take weddings that seriously ya but as family but then i don't i don't want to look like some stupid dressed up witch word  no i think most of the family members are gonna dress up well my mum is certainly gonna dress quite a lot so just wear it lah i mean how often do you get to wear it ave you worn it before i've never worn it before see but i i'm bringing it as formal attire to word just in case you have to in front of the word  okay topic number two awful we haven't entirely exhausted it either okay what else are you gonna talk about the wedding what are you wearing i'm just going to exactly that i bought what your speech you said you gonna show me it's uhm we have all the parts already oh present word that oh no need i'll i'll come i'll ought to read it out to show you how how it sounds and if you feel it's not very good then you will you can add by the way this is a wedding speech okay okay alright i'm gonna start with good evening ladies and gentlemen on this historical day the twenty-eight day of august nineteen ninety-three two significant events were solemnised singaporeans elected a new president wee that's that's national twenty-eight polling oh okay okay and of course the more significant of the two events the wedding of kao yen and geraldine then my cousin would say in many ways these events are similar one person has been elected to lead the nation the other has been elected to head a new family then i'll come in and say and i'm sure geraldine must be thrilled with her power and responsibility and then we'll on this is just an introduction okay alright the interlude i won't word the interlude do your song and dance is it no no no in the interlude we're going to talk about how the bride and groom met one another oh are you where they met one another and what they saw in one another those typical corny sort of thing but we're going to by the way you surely invited word  of course not you know what liang wanted to say how did yen meet up with geraldine then someone will say by dumping shirley why don't you do that cannot no you are ah ma's spy network she says that yuen is still seeing shirley no not at all they see her accidentally in the bus because she how how did she you told me she is quite frantic about being dumped and replaced ya but now there's nothing she's more controlled now is it ya that's good i was afraid she's about to turn up with a chopper and okay what what did ah ma's spy say i don't know where ah ma so my my mom said oh word i said who told you this then she said ah ma then i said how does ah ma know okay what did okay what did ah ma say ah ma says that uhm uh when you all go out or something like that uhm yuen will whisper whisper on the phone oh you use her phone for a start to that's that's why i asked you about how does ah ma okay but whisper can be whispering to anyone ya ya ya to anyone and uh ah ma says oh why should he have to use my phone uhm why should he have to whisper if it's so my father said why can't it be geraldine right maybe he's whispering sweet-nothings or something like so that's why i said the spy network is entirely faulty awful dreadful woman do you know grandmother is dreadful she's absolutely awful i mean she's like she doesn't wish you well at all she no no the worst thing is in front of everyone she's so sweet and benign right  ya ya ya right and if and all these sort of things behind
