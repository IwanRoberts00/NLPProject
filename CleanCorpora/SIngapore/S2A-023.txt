""
uh uh thank you susan
""
can you hear me
""
oh dear i my
""
first of all a level of apology
""
i held everybody up the tra traffic was really heavy along the way
""
uhm my first uh and initial and at a journalist gut responses say it
doesn't help and we don't want a standard singapore a dictionary of standard
singapore english
""
i say this because uhm i have a i've got a very big title for a very
difficult job in the newspaper and basically i was brought in there to deal
with all the language problems that the editors could not handle and didn't
have the time to handle and didn't want to handle which is why uh reporters
especially young reporters always making grammatical mistakes
""
and in the newsroom everything goes under the label of grammatical
whether it's lexical whether it's anything else at all it's grammatical
""
so uh i'm there some kind of arbiter telling people that this is
okay that's not okay and uh this ought to be better etcetra etcetra
""
so in a way i'm a setter of standards but i feel very uhm uncertain
about my role very ambivalent cos' on the one hand uh you've got a scholl of
thought there which says that it's got to be very standard which by very
standard they mean british english
""
for example we have an editor or they think they they they they
think what they want is no they want what they think is british english which
may not be standard british english
""
we have an editor who is uh quite old fashioned who is very good
writer who is a lover of the word and uhm who also objects to things like
meet with who objects recently who objected recently to the use of pants
""
uhm i don't know what sort of context i've to find that out because
that was a very recent sort of message sent down to the newsroom
""
and then on the other hand we have to look at the purpose of a
newspaper uhm the function because the newspaper is a medium of communication
between the the newsmaker whoever he is government politician or or or a big
businessman and the reader
""
and it's a it's i see it because i come from education as an
exercise of nation-building
""
you try to communicate with your readers you try to build up
consensus or or you try to not to build up consensus
""
you want to you want to encourage discussion or not necessarily
dissent but discussion at least and you want to make a the your reader aware
of your environment
""
so we look at the news the straits times
""
there's it's like singapore in uhm in forty pages you know
""
you've the hard news the page one news where all the important news
from around the world and locally you know is reflected in the straits times
""
you've got the back page where all the big news about what's
happening in the money world is reflected in the back page
""
and then you've a section which is rather softer and with a bit of
uh they've book reviews
""
there are features that are of human interest then you've the
political analysis page you've got the editorial page you've got the forum
page where readers write in to tell you what they think they like what they
don't like etcetera
""
then you've got a community page which is in the section called
life uh which deals with uh particularly singaporean problems
""
it used to be a bilingual section but it's now called community so
we deal with social problems we deal with all kinds of problems
""
and then there's a what do you call the news uhm home news which is
all the accidents uh list of divorces but that's out now but accidents
robbery burglary uhm foul-ups on the highway all that gets in as well as all
the campaigns and etcetera whatever
""
so that's a newspaper so it's singapore in forty pages
""
now uhm so obviously it's not possible to say we want to reflect
what we think is standard british because i think that's a crazy notion
""
so what do i do i've spent ten years there and i've spent the
better part of five years trying to reconcile in my own mind what my job is
and i decided that the most important thing is to say we want a bit of this
and a bit of that
""
but we've got to be guided by certain basic principles and the
basic principle i have thought out is uh the context
""
the context is a guiding concept which is if you see it as a
triangle uhm it's going to be the message or the story the content
""
what is the purpose of this story that you're telling
""
if it's an editorial you want to persuade somebody to believe
something then your message is i want to persuade singaporeans to believe
that a is b or a is not b
""
if it's a news report then i want to just tell this bit of news
there was an accident at whatever place at whatever time and so many people
were hurt uhm
""
if it is entertainment i want to entertain so that's your story or
message at the top of this triangle
""
now of course at one end you're going to have the reader or writer
sorry reader or hearer
""
and in the newspaper context it's always reader because we've
written we're a written communication so it's a reader
""
what kind of reader he is he is
""
has he got 'o' levels is he uhm is he part of the elite
""
whoever these people are the in is he an intellectual is he a
businessman housewife retiree young school student 'a' level
""
whatever what is he looking for when he turns to your story then
the other end you've got the writer
""
the writer has got her innate capacity facility with language love
of the word or somebody who knows the facts but doesn't know the language
very well and she has to have a style of her own
""
and these these i wish i have a there is a wall id uhm if i'm
taking too long just stop me you know because we're used to newspaper to
chopping and chopping everything you know whenever time is up
""
so i'm used to that another five minutes so in this is the writer
""
so depending on on what these variables are the language gets
selected
""
it's always come some sound selection as they write they begin to
know what what words to to to to what words to use what words are can be
allowed and what cannot be allowed
""
for example some of the words that rosemary uh gave us that
beautiful long list
""
i didn't know i've been a friend of hers for twenty years
""
i didn't know that she was compiling this marvellous thing uhm
""
what was it like what did she have like the word shiok for example
you know the word those of you who are singaporeans oh i'm sorry ya can you
can you hear me now
""
yes i was going on about the word shiok you know i think all
singaporeans here know exactly what it means
""
i don't know whether jonathan knows
""
do you know
""
oh it haven't well can somebody explain to him
""
it's it's like delicious marvellous great the word shiok yeh
""
 laughs 
""
not shok but you know but but is that how it's pronounced
""
shirley you must help me out on this
""
 laughs 
""
oh okay look at another word uhm okay look at the word amok
""
you know the word amuck is spelt amuck
""
is that how you spell or amok amok
""
right now very we're very fond of this word cos' i think it's a
beautiful word
""
if a man runs wild with a parang or with a revolver whatever and
shoots twenty people and he's absolutely crazy uhm you can't call him a wild
man you can't call him a mad man
""
all these do not convey that's that situation you know
""
and i think the word amuck does now
""
uhm how would the writer know whether that's useable or not
""
i think they would immediately reach for word for that word because
it's so colourful and it communicates to the singaporean exactly uh what he
wants to convey but uhm they have some problems with that word which i think
su susan will later on come to talk about
""
yap now uhm maybe think of another word uhm let me give you an
easier example
""
you know the word kids k-i-d-s
""
i know it's frowned on by some people for example uh the eminent
sir what his name now
""
quirk ronald quirk uhm randolph sir randolph quirk yap uhm we used
to have a page called kids and things and i used i used to have to deal with
uh problems like this
""
we had people uhm sub-editors from the times of london and so who
were working in the newsroom
""
when i appeared on the scene they say look let's get together and
ban this word kids i said i'm not here in the process of banning anything or
legislating or laying down the law
""
uhm we have to get together to learn to use the english language in
a way that is acceptable to ourselves and to others and the objection was
kids means baby goats
""
now you know that's a very old fashioned and very restricted
meaning of the word kids
""
i don't know whether you will agree now uhm so we had this problem
of the the word little a little corner of a page for children
""
it's called kids and things you know those little crossword puzzles
they can do things they can make and so on
""
now what do you do with that
""
do you say the word kids is non-standard and therefore you know you
want the paper to write good english or to reflect good english so out with
the word kids
""
what do you put in its place children and things
""
you destroy the whole corner that that page but if we had the
headline like uhm ministry of education to test two thousand school children
""
that's a headline for a very formal story which is based on a on a
press release sent out by the minister of education
""
do you then say ministry of education to test two thousand school
kids
""
no because you know uh you spoil the style of it the tone the the
the the style is supposed the best the better word the best word of that
headline in that story so it's your one minute here that's just enough for me
to fix this
""
 laughs 
""
so you you go back to this concept and you use this to select your
language
""
if your story is very formal it should be formal the purpose of
your story  word  singpaoreanisms
""
so how can you not have words like shiok and alamak and so on in it
because it's part of the story
""
if your reader your reader is a young singaporean you better have a
voice that he can relate to
""
if your writer is not capable of doing humour then don't try to do
a piece of on singaporeanisms
""
that's basically uh to answer your question just two
""
now so uh although my gut feeling is to say that we don't want a
dictionary of singapore english because i don't think my editors will approve
""
although they gave me permission to be here not knowing what i'm
going to do here
""
i think we the thing that they can live i can live with in the
context of my work there is to say that in a way the newspaper is trying not
to prescribe but to to test the limits of what's possible in terms of uh
variations from standard which people have in their minds and therefore a
dictionary of singapore english is the other side of the coin 
""
we both help to compile that because fr' not forgetting we are
singapore in forty pages we we try we help to compile that and so most of the
examples came from the straits times and at the same time when that tome is
compiled we are the people who can in some ways best demonstrate the use of
uhm these words in the dictionary because we are not restricted to like for
example simon is talking about creative writing literature and someone else
talking about uhm something else but we have everything in the newspaper we
are sort of to some extent specialist and in many ways generalist we have
everything in the newspaper in forty pages so i don't know whether that
answers the question thank you
