residents of ulu pandan and friends we are coming back again to ulu pandan after the last general election what do we find we find that the pap is on the defensive this time never before has the pap been on a defensive in any general election but they are at this particular point of time why because the sdp has adopted the right strategy we have called upon the other opposition parties to field less candidates so that to make this election a by-election we have the by-election effect and as it turned out on nomination day the pap had 41 uncontested seats and there are 40 seats for the people to choose their credible opposition from so you understand this it is not a step backwards it is not a retreat on the part of the opposition it is in fact a strategy that we have adopted and the pap now has got no answer to it because now they are at the mercy of the electorate the electorate can vote credible opposition at their choice what is a by-election what is a by-election a by-election is an election when even you vote all the opposition they can never come to power because there is already a government a government is already in power that is a by-election so once the pap is in power after having got the 41 seats we consider the balance of the seats are contested as a by-election now this is our strategy and it is the right strategy as has been mentioned by guan yu keng this jayakumar and all the other pap members have trying tried to dismiss the sdp's strategy but they cannot jayakumar has said what is this that this strategy is about he says that the people wants to vote in a good slate of pap mp because of this strategy mr chiam said ask them to vote the opposition and then what happen if they vote the opposition he says that it would be a vote for the opposition and it would a vote against the endorsement of mr goh chok tong he says this will send conflicting signals but i do not see it at all i think mr jayakumar has got it all wrong himself the fact is that since 1984 or maybe earlier the electorate of singapore has seen the harsh policies of the pap they have seen how the pap take money from the people with all kinds of means they have got a social problem and they use the social problem to get money out of it they have a social problem of car congestion and they thought in fact they have taken advantage of the car congestion and make plenty of money out of it you know and i know they have got car import tax they have got arf now we have got coe we got high registration fee we got parking fee all kinds all added up not only car owners suffer but of course if we are business people so the people are quite fed up and they want opposition this is what the people want they want opposition but because opposition for the time being is weak they are not confident they don't want to vote the opposition into power but they still want the pap to be the government but they want substantial strong opposition to check the pap and this is the real feedback from the ground it is not that the people want to vote the pap actually they don't want if they can help it if there is a good slate of opposition they would throw them out of office out of the government if there are but that will be another day for us so that is the true reading of the ground the people want opposition substantial opposition they want the pap to be in power and so now we have given what the people want a by-election you can vote as many opposition as possible and when you vote the opposition it is not a conflicting signal this is the correct signal to the pap you have to vote more opposition strong opposition not only to establish opposition in parliament make opposition part of our political culture not only that but also an effective an effective hammer over the head of pap if you don't do that what will happen you can bet your last dollar after this election prices will sure to go up the pap now tells you that the issue is medifund edusave and whatever but don't believe a word of it you want to ask them what is behind all these issues that is more important it is not the front issues it is what is hidden behind they haven't told you that is more important because you remember in 1988 what were the issues the elected president they say only to take care of the reserve and then we have got the town council they said oh if opposition come in the rubbish heap will go two storeys high all untrue those were the issues but they then did not tell you that in fact once they get elected with a majority strong mandate the other issues are hidden behind as price increases mr ling how doong our chairman and candidate at bukit gombak now you know what happen after the 1998 election it was only held in september the 1st about not three years yet you know what happened of course immediately after the general election your hdb car park from 25 to 50 dollars we have got hefty increases in medical and hospitalisation fees so now you better watch out if you get sick you better make sure you have money in your pocket otherwise you cannot afford to get sick you can afford to die but you cannot afford to get sick hefty increases in school fees for independent schools hefty increases in university fees the poor taxi drivers who were always supporters or many of them were supporters were supporters of the pap have now got to pay 7007 for their diesel tax everybody is fond of watching tv your tv license also gone up so these are the issues which they dare not tell you yes all sorts of taxes not only pub tax and in the case of the elected president once the law is made not only the power to veto the use of reserves but in fact they have got a whole host of other powers in fact the elected president has so much powers that when he really functions i think the prime minister will have a tough time in doing what he wants to do so that is that that is the thing i think all singaporeans know of today now what is the main issue in this general election the main issue is not giving a resounding mandate to mr goh chok tong that has got nothing to do with you what is important is this general election is whether you want a strong opposition in parliament that is the issue remember that and as far as sdp is concerned we don't bother about what goh chok tong wants we not we are not bothered whether you want a big endorsement whether he wants a strong mandate that doesn't not concern you how does it benefit you if he gets a 100% mandate how does it concern you in fact he will have more power to impose more taxes it does not benefit the people of singapore at all they have already the mandate they have got 41 seats they are in power so that question is entirely out you are not concerned with it at all when he talk to you he says that the issue is myself you say you just forget it don't worry the worry the worrying thing is that whether there is strong opposition in parliament because it is not only for the long-term interest of singapore but it is directly for your interest directly for your interest the more opposition you have the less the pap has power on you it is a direct proportion the more power the pap has the more they can tax on you they can do whatever they want in order to get the pap power down you must have a balancing power of more opposition and this is a very important message and we want the people of singapore to understand this we in the sdp has taken the trouble to reduce our own number of candidates to make sure that we have a by-election effect what happen on nomination day if there is 41 opposition candidates standing for election and pap 40 we will take the trouble to ask one of our members to come back down let them have 41 that is the way how we feel so strongly about our strategy because now you can vote in the opposition member you want to vote for a long time and that is the true feedback we get and today i'm here to support mr ashleigh seow you cannot get a better candidate in ulu pandan than mr seow he is a highly qualified man he has got a b.a. honours degree in public administration from the university of western australia he has travelled widely he has travelled widely in australia in england in europe and he has got a lot of international exposure he is a mature person and not only that he has got the benefit of hands-on experience not only in running a town council but also in setting up a town council we in potong pasir we have a town council which we run ourselves we don't neglect our responsibility we do it ourselves all the responsibility we bear on our shoulders we don't chuck it to some professional managing agent to do it for us like other pap town councils so mr seow has seen the setting up of the potong pasir town council before it was formerly come into operation we had the ground work laid see that all the paperwork was right we have to engage staff we have to send the staff for training he has to organise well that is how he is only known in potong pasir so he is the right man for you because at the town council here he will make sure that it no only functions well but perhaps functions even better than potong pasir as you know because we did it ourselves we have a lower cost and we need not raise the service and conservancy charges we did not do it we did it only after 15 months 15 months after the hdb first raised their service and conservancy charges we were able to hold back and 9 months after the 1st pap town council raised their service and conservancy charges so the issue of the town council now is never brought up by the pap because potong pasir town council the performance at potong pasir has silenced them once and for all they cannot go around like the 1988 elections threatening people if you elect an opposition mp he may not be able to run your town council the rubbish will heap up to the second floor your corridors are not swept the prices of your flats will fall these are all not true because we have proven it at potong pasir if you try to but your flat in potong pasir you probably have to pay more than in any other including but more importantly is not just the cleaning and keep the place clean that is with efficiency of service that is probably the easy part the most difficult part is how to build it into a community how to build it into a closely whole and how to get the people at the constituency to do things for themselves and be proud that we are the people who are really in charge and not the pap  and we show that we don't need the pap people can do things themselves that is the more important function of the town council and we at potong pasir may try to do what we preach we have the town council which are representatives of the residents there are 4 total or more who are non-sdp members and therefore our town council unlike the other pap town councils we are not political i am the political representative there anytime can be outvoted because they have the majority i am not worried because i know they are residents they care for their own town potong psir town they care for their own surroundings they were only to make sure that things are correct for the town so the issue of town council is never brought out again although they say that it is explicitly going to be an issue of this election now i think we have put the pap on the defensive you can see goh chok tong is already retreating at first he came out very strongly and say unless i get an endorsement i may not have the power or the ability to implement edusave and medisave and the people and opposition gets more firm as the people understand the strategy of the opposition the people understand that they can vote in more opposition this time goh chok tong he's afraid now you can see he report in the papers oh no no even if i get a weak endorsement i will still implement these policies and because of the onslaught of this good strategy he can't think properly for a prime minister what is he saying he says that in fact it was stated by bg lee he said that if the opposition wins 40 seats possibility is there a possibility of the win of the opposition win 40 seats then it will be a weak endorsement for the pap and goh chok tong goes to say that if the opposition wins 40 seats then it would be not an endorsement for his leadership and he will step down do you know that marine parade is a contested constituency they have a opposition contesting in marine parade if the pap lost 40 seats goh chok tong will have lost his seat he will not be in parliament he will be kicked out he cannot step down he will be kicked out i'm surprised that mr goh can make such a mistake not realising that his own marine parade is contested a contested seat there it is not a question of if it is the pap lost 40 seats it is not a question of not endorsing his leadership in fact they don't want him even to be a member of parliament now my last duty here is to appeal to all of you residents here at ulu pandan if you are staying in these flats please tell your neighbours who are not here your relatives your friends your colleagues at your work-places if you go to the market the store-holders the shopkeepers tell them all tell them all that this is a by that there is a by-election effect tell them all to vote in credible opposition wherever you see one you vote them in and please tell them to vote in the sdp candidate he is a credible opposition give him a chance to show that he can do better than the pap candidate all the time the pap claim that they are the only good ones but because the opposition has never given a chance now is the chance for you to vote mr ashleigh seow as your next member of parliament vote in ashleigh seow make him your next member of parliament i'm very proud to present ashleigh seow to you and i am sure he will make a very good member of parliament you can see for yourself he is a very sincere man approachable person anytime you got any problem you just give him a ring and he will come running to you can you say that of any pap member of parliament well i suppose ashleigh seow is too big for him to kiss i'm a smaller person yes i appeal to you i urge you please vote in ashleigh seow we have got one member of the opposition in parliament let us see many many more new faces and when you turn on the tv parliament tonight you will definitely find it more interesting thank you very much
