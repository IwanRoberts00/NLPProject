one is big this is quite big different size prawn and well i can put some pork instead put in a waste uh you use ya i i'll put some pork for the ca cauliflower lor instead of the prawns don't know lah you can use all half lah half lah even the beans uh are hard then luncheon meat ah wei ha luncheon meat ah how do you want to do it fry ah ah okay lor i've not eaten for very long you fry the luncheon meat first lah because i need time to cut up the beans you need time i do the cooking lah i thought of a dish you cook one dish you can cook for the rest of the week ee so dirty how much cauliflower did you buy also around there maybe smaller piece okay let's test this thing whether it works or not if not switch for so long it doesn't work ya aye what are you doing aye i fry i fry okay you have to hang hang if you send send her out of the kitchen ah there won't any noise leh you hang around there do some work wash the dishes assist me in cooking well open the can open the can okay this one do you want to word ah give me a bowl actually i'm full lah after the curry puff please wash the bowl ee you know today ah gregory said if you can uh bring two three million of this new business why not go ahead i'll support you you know of course so he said you carve your own niche whatever kind of loans you want to do but i'm afraid lah how start from where start from the branches i don't know how could the branch endorse that he don't want the person to be too good also why because he won't need you he'll say get lost i'm meeting my target's fine maybe have to call kenneth aye so few ah how can lah what else aye actually i don't like that black bean fish you know you don't ah very stiff one the fish i like ah i i i mean can't eat it all the time but occasionally i like that fish has been selling very well my father likes it very much but i don't really like but that ah you can't put in the microwave you know what what the fish because it's gets harder and harder and then you can't eat it then steam ah ya you you have to try to ee uh you have to try finish it no but the first time round you gotta heat it up oh just put in here lor microwave lah not very good but it's got a very good pan lah can lah it's okay lah microwave excuse me can you go somewhere else my mum used to fry this with what eggs you want to kah up everything no you can't finish word  i think it's good for sandwiches ya by the way finish off the corn beef you alone i like leh i don't like i like corn beef you know i didn't tell my sister i don't like <aye you know what gregory said today what i told you right the table that i prepared and then he didn't see that he just ask me to make a copy for the rest of them and then he didn't keep a copy for himself ya ah so today ah i just joking said you know no no he said he ask me uh where is your table ah i've been waiting for very long the thing's that i showed it to you what at a meeting that day he say ya but i want a copy for myself then i was wondering why you took so long so i said but all of us thought you didn't want to keep a copy you know oh then he say then i i said as i was quite hurt that after i put in so much effort you don't want a copy then he said oh no no no no no don't misunderstand i want it then he said oh next time if you clear our set you must tell me you know aye he has a lot of experience leh you know he was with the main branch leh for one year as a cadet officer then subsequently he join bedok branch as second officer second officer is something like assistant manager ah ha then after he was posted to a few other branches to set up new branches like world trade centre world trade centre is one of highest profit-making branches so eventually they posted him back to retail banking head office ah to clear up the mess he said everywhere he went ah is the best is a new challenge and he he feels very slippery one you know but he still made it and he just have to do it you know so he said actually a lot of thing he's not very happy with it he he just bear with them like having he just have to live with it having to start from so many ya i think after you have done well increases your confidence and you don't feel wah you know jumpy and all that that's why in the us ah there are lot of people there're special specialise in turn around situation they told me you know something is wrong then they go in they are company doctor or or when the company is doing well and all that ah wah they got no role for themselves ah they're good in problem solving but they're not good in uh you know planning ahead improving on what is a really good you know oh we have too many fruits you know aye the nectarines are not nice ah how ah so many left i don't mind eating them but i can't finish it's quite big which one is it don't know sufficient or not ha this luncheon meat aye must buy this one nah the oyster sauce you want me to cut up more oh i think enough lah only two of us so it does seem that there is quite a lot of scope for you ah ya not really tied down to one function forever he he told me he wants to train me uh in product development as well so that i have a wider scope you know ya he said at the end of the day he wants uh most of us lah to have experience in credit processing means credit checking and then marketing to the new roles and product planning then he said the new guy that might be coming in will do another major product so i'll be with jasmine it seems that product quite a lot of work uh it is a very active product i mean the club fifty-five plus he organise a lot of things for the old folks you know and the take up rate is very good of course because it is an on-going aye it's a growth market you know we have more and more people ageing ah and i tell you one secret ah not secret lah one bonus points for us is that oub is very close to cpf board and if you want to withdraw you know when you reach fifty-five years you can withdraw ex excess uh over the minimum sum and can only withdraw at oub not any other local banks you know through oub ah only oub you come to oub you with the cpf statement stating how much you have in excess over your minimum sum then we'll give you a cashier's order or cash and then at that point in time of course they will sell oh why don't deposit into our account so we are the only bank given that right right ya and because of our linkage with cpf board ah we have access to all the data-base you know i thought that is confidential cannot be confidential lah because we are the paying agent nah we we have to have the dividends also and we make use of that lah to send direct mailers it's a growing lah ya that's why jasmine has to work sort of like full-time you know on this product and cut time on the the credit procession aye you don't want to cut into half ah oh oh for me in this size is is okay normally i like to cut into half ya then cut lor these two for me ah hor the rest i cut it's easier to fry also because the burnt corners that's the differences that we have are you meeting that phuah fellow on friday ah tentatively lah okay lor anyway only thursday ah he may not turn up also ai ya no lah not that he won't turn up he may cancel it i think he's he's okay sounds like he got lot of things to tell me this is a lot i must make courtesy we haven't cook i must make courtesy calls to your edb people ah why if they have any companies that come to them for help uh i'm sure when you were there did any company come to you and ask you how to go about making a loan no they they they know i mean that that basic things they know i mean if they can't let government know do you recommend any banks also no we're not supposed to oh oh because we maybe you know accuse of favoritism so by big six consulting we are not supposed to leh although we know that that the manager very well and he's supposed to be quite cool lah we are not supposed to because they can come around and and and say that aye you say that lah then we'll be in trouble aye you have not cook the rice lah ha the rice ya lah i have to get excuse never mind never mind i do lah oh then how i think ah there's no need lah because because most companies they do know how to go to the bank they don't need to come to edb and then they say ya lah but they don't come to me leh you know i feel like handling the hot-line i'm better at tele-marketing don't know lah maybe i'll ask maybe you go the branch first and to take a look what's the situation so because back in dbs through the hot-line you pull in a lot of customers you know especially housing loans aye ya hot-line is handled by the girls but they can ref they can pass the phone to me if they have housing loan and apartments actually housing loan you need a more officer ya they should will definitely ask oh what is your financial term do we need evaluation from you they need all this what you didn't switch on or what  interruption  the pickup rate for machinery loans has increased the past year it has drop aye but i read in the brochure ah in my product book ah guide book your oems overseas you also cater for those who want to purchase shares in foreign companies you know uh coming as from ah but they put there you know for uh purchase of industrial facilities machines and purchase of shares wah i'm sorry maybe there's something i don't know i i mean either that one is wrong or i'm not updated but the last time we have ebd aux and all that you know when this was mentioned it was no mention of that  actually it's unlikely you know because you buy shares uh you'll lead to speculation it's just like buying you know and your equity local equity is thirty or fifty per cent ah you must have at least fifty-one per cent oems overseas also lo locals overseas uh not necessary but you will if if you are minority share holder uh we'll we'll not give you everything we'll cut down lets say if you are thirty per cent overseas ah you want to borrow one million for the this one wash already ah no lets say you want to borrow one million for your factory overseas ah we would only give you thirty per cent of one million because you your equity share of that factory is only
