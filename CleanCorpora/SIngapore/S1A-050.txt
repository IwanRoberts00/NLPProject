""
""
aye uh uhm i heard you are going to england
""
""
is it true
""
yes
""
""
which part of england
""
""
the whole of uk
""
""
won't it take a long time to cover all those places
""
""
it will if you want to see every place
""
but i mean i have got twenty four days so i will just choose certain
places of interest
""
""
precise  word 
""
""
popular places to tourist uh to see
""
""
twenty four
""
twenty four days is not a long time you know
""
""
aye i still want to go to paris you know
""
""
to paris
""
so what are the places in england you are going to visit
""
""
well
""
i will be in london for a week and then hopefully uh i might break
off and to paris for about four to five days and then after that i will go to
scotland and then from scotland uh work my way down to london
""
""
walk your way down
""
""
work my way
""
""
oh oh okay
""
""
down to london and then i think that would probably use up all
use up all my leave uh
""
""
are you are you going alone or what
""
""
no i am going with a an ex-colleague and her boyfriend
""
""
aye uh so interesting
""
the three of you
""
""
of course who else
""
""
so you are babysitter in a way uh
""
""
no she is quite a a good traveller even though she is young
but she is quite good
""
""
suppose  word  to go with john and chong
and company
""
""
uh initially we were suppose to go back to the states but the
whole gin gang but well slowly everybody start deciding not to go back to the
states
""
so choy peng wants to europe
""
pat wants to go europe
""
and then uh i have decided not to go back
""
so the group starts dwindling uh
""
so in the end i think chong and john also will not be going
""
i i don't think they fancy the uh idea of travelling with a married
couple
""
""
yes
""
and a kid too
""
""
so anyway uh lai kwen will be going back soon
""
""
is it
""
when
""
""
i heard is june the nineteen she will back
""
but she will for her holidays then after that she will go back to
continue
""
""
but i thought you are suppose to go down to hawaii to meet her
right
""
""
that was our initial plan uh uhm but the thing is
""
well i guess the attraction isn't there
""
""
 word  chor hoon will be back
""
""
chor hoon will be coming from uh australia
""
""
oh just nice uh during your holidays
""
""
what about yourself uh
""
where you going
""
""
i will be baby-sitting the whole month
""
""
how interesting
""
""
yes
""
""
you never go on leave uh
""
""
i do but how to how to get out of singapore
""
i mean so many obligations then got to stay finish finish my work
""
but i think i want to take some days off uh
""
go to sentosa or where
""
go and go and you know
""
let myself go and know
""
relax there don't bother you know
""
""
why don't you thought of going back to the states
""
to oregon
""
""
wanted to uh but so far away
""
so expensive also
""
""
what you are working for
""
""
when i go back there i don't know anybody there what
""
most pe most of my my friends would have graduated
""
""
uh uh true
""
""
go back to go back to visit my professors
""
i think some of them are not there anymore
""
""
aye uh for all you know
""
you know all of them gone because i heard the last time oregon was
cutting down on certain departments
""
""
is it
""
""
last time when i i went they have already cut down
""
their p e department is already about gone
""
""
oh really
""
""
it is no longer a department by itself
""
it is now the department with
""
i don't know what the department
""
""
uh i do miss oregon uh those apples apples cherries
""
""
prunes
""
""
prunes yes
""
""
limes
""
""
yes
""
""
peaches
""
""
yes the weather
""
""
uh so so so you should go
""
""
maybe it will do good for my skin uh
""
""
uh
""
why uh
""
you you never had such problems when you are you are there
""
""
 word  the weather uh
""
what to do
""
when i come when when i came back here all these problems crop up
""
uh i think is the stress
""
maybe i should really take a break you know
""
how to
""
every time i want take a break something will crop up you know
""
now i got to do baby-sitting you know for for two kids uh
""
""
why
""
""
why uh
""
don't know uh
""
so when you are setting up for the for your for england
""
""
fifth
""
i am leaving on the fifth
""
""
before the end of
""
this is may right
""
""
uh
""
i leaving on the fifth
""
""
fifth of june
""
""
the fifth of june
""
""
coming back just before the term begins uh
""
""
coming back on the twenty ninth
""
so i will land in singapore on the thirtieth
""
""
uh wait jet lag boy
""
""
two more days uh
""
that is what i am worried about you know jet lag
""
""
uh most probably you will take a week to rest
""
""
no i think i am quite used to it already after being
""
uh after having gone to the states for two instance two times
three times
""
maybe i think i sort of got used to the
""
""
i think this is one reason why i don't want to go on tour you
know
""
you get more tired when you come back home
""
not only do you waste your money you come back you get tired some
more
""
""
you are going sentosa
""
""
aye uh no rest at all
""
""
i mean  word  where you go on uh
""
i mean for that kind of tours that i go on i get tired because we
all
""
""
uh i know uh camp camp on on the slope of the hill when it is
minus three degrees celsius
""
rains in the mid of the night
""
get my socks all wet
""
""
that that you go and blame evelyn okay not i  word
""
""
""
backache boy i rather live in a motel uh and pay for the
difference uh
""
""
you uh and not adventurous at all
""
""
uh maybe should go to do some mountain climbing like bukit
timah uhm hill
""
""
if you call that a mountain
""
""
i have not been up there before
""
""
you haven't
""
""
i have not uh
""
i still i should take really go there and take a good look
""
""
uh i think why don't you become a tourist of singapore and
then tour all the places of interest
""
""
take mrt train from boon lay all the way to pasir ris
""
maybe i should do some some
""
""
aye the bukit timuh reserve is quite a nice place in that
case
""
""
i heard lots of mosquitoes too right
""
""
don't know
""
but the climb up there is tiring
""
""
who is is saying about climbing
""
i can always use the path what
""
walk your way up
""
""
it is still up climb  word  right
""
we still have to go up
""
""
you mean you can't drive up there
""
""
i don't know
""
i think only halfway
""
""
is it
""
""
 word  i don't think you can go all the
way up just half way
""
and then you have to do the rest by climbing on foot
""
""
anyway it is short uh
""
the whole month of june doesn't doesn't sound long you know
""
""
please uh you just go out of singapore to a foreign country
""
""
okay uh i will go to penang uh
""
""
well that that that might be good you know
""
penang is quite a relaxing place also
""
""
i can go and disturb someone there
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
