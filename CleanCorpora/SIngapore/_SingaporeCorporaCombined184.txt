one thing they can tell the thais is not to take the guys in green lightly myanmar's football have certainly their football has certainly been more colourful than their outfits allowing it to run vitoon here's attapong offside though well i've got a feeling that soe naing who uh did quite a good job marking fandi ahmad out at the first ninety minutes of the game against singapore in the semi-finals will be given the task of marking piyahpong again and min zaw who went for sundram that day will go for vitoon he has lost it for a little while actually that was min zaw oo and soe naing with that saving tackle then toe aung so a nervous start indeed for myanmar they're an inexperience squad not used to matches of this high magnitude but like i've said they've maintained nice splat of oozing self-belief and confidence they need it more so now kyi lwin who is one of their more experienced players they'll be a calling on him to over ball in mid-field and settle the team down at the moment it's thailand who are faster in settling down ye htut it would be at a right time there for myanmar not a very good clearance surachai min zaw oo with good tackle and here's myo hlaing the top scorer of this competition with six goals tin myo aung who uh was taken over myint aung up front  word to bounce to the ball then and here's attapong vitoon kijmongkonsak wins the first corner of the afternoon in the sea games soccer final thailand after four minutes are looking livelier and brighter up front and uh passing has been more fluent as well but myanmar it is who win the header it's not all the way out though they're slow in moving up that's why vitton is offside apichad almost got to the end of it tawan sripan well won though by than toe aung good ball clear by toe aung and that's myanmar's football for you throughout this tournament nice one touch passing oh it's saved by the thai goalkeeper and that's one of the greatest goals you'll ever see at the national stadium scored by that guy again myo hlaing win myanmar ahead in the sea games soccer final and really the inexperience of the eighteen year old goalkeeper somcit wacharapong was very evident there in the thai goal it's a big sin in goal keeping you'll always have to make sure that your body is behind the ball at time his body wasn't even around that and his reflexes were very poor that's the way to do it says aung kyaw kyaw as he gathered that shot from uh attakpong quite easily and really that effort looked harmless vitton this is turning out to be a magnificent final unbelievable and you're just describing myanmar's character and how interesting it is if thailand were to go a ball down since they haven't been a goal down before in the tournament well this is their word  well we were just talking about vitoon being up front with piyapong and vitoon doesn't have the pace of a striker and doesn't have the traditional sense of a striker but he's certainly showed the finishing touches of a striker then piyapong just well he's all fired up for the final yes word he set the tournament alive like we expected him to so but when piyapong is on form and the thais are now inspired myanmar better watch them well that's been myanmar's football all the time in the games they'll score a goal they'll conceive one it's always hoping but they always believe in attacking whatever the case kyaw kyaw the word looking suspect indeed and being with a cross so we have two goals in two minutes so naing in the fifth for myanamr and vitoon in the seventh for thailand it's one all a well-balanced final indeed i suppose exactly what happened in the bang against malaysia and they're going a goal up earlier on and then malaysia scoring fairly quicker myanmar have been very disciplined moving forward but not really at the back that was the eighth goal conceived from them kyi lywin lovely play by kyi lywin again and he's taken off against uh singapore and it seems that he was taken off at half time probably to rest him for the final and that's how confident the myanmar players were he was limping a bit but he wasn't really that bad when you consider that malek had pulled a hamstring in the semi-finals and was taken off immediately before the scoring of the two sides well played by moe kyaw tawan sripan this is a wonderful run by him he's beaten two men two men nine word up for vitoon again and well we apologise as the scorer of thailand well there was no need to actually it's was just very badly struck from the number forty thailand goal will relate to that very well thailand have certainly started the game up much brighter and more confident than myanmar well with the experience big big game well turning it on that counts most thailand are certainly going it towards a gold medal in the sea games soccer final and it's that guy piyapong pueon who wins a header two headers remember in the final in nineteen eighty-three against singapore got thailand on the way to a two one victory on the gold medal and this header could prove to be very important as well in the eleventh minute thailand lead by two goals to one once again very poor defending by myanmar he's already stated that this could be his last sea games and they want to bring the gold medal back desperately to thailand they haven't won it since nineteen eighty-five and they win singapore two nil on home ground but myo hlaing we all know about myanmar's come back word  how determined they are and they word back at you good work once again by myo hlaing thought that was a foul actually and they claim that it's a pass back by the defender myo hlaing the goalkeeper didn't pick that one up so a relief indeed to somcit wacharapong his fifth minute error is giving myanmar that kind of start they wanted myo hlaing he has been the live wire of the myanmar team at the moment myo hlaing he's the only one who wants the ball just attacking it the rest they're just waiting for the ball to land at their feet kyaw kyaw finding some room for that cross myanmar remember the privilege two of the most exciting matches in the sea games against malaysia and of course the epic battle in the semi-final against singapore myo aung tawan sripan too much of the ball myo hlaing wins good skill again by myo hlaing oh lovely ball played outside here's ye htut can he get the cross in no and he doesn't even get the corner good work by surasak tungsurat nice little leap by piyahpong well won in the air here's surasak tungsurat there phathanapong not convincely surachai as well here's apichad thaveechalerndit he started out as a right back in this tournament and he's moved forward to uh mid-field now after is he's word placed in the middle of the path against malaysia and indonesia good work by the seventeen year old zaw oo and here's kyi lwin that's more like it from kyi lwin the spreading play up myo hlaing taking over good play here's kyi lwin myo hlaing again great tackle second time around as well by apichad thaveechalermdit and myanmar could be in trouble here the thais are very quick they're trying to break that time on the counter they almost did then toe aung who scored five goals in the tournament so far nice oh it was a typical myanmar move myanmar are very slick on the ground doing a lot of player surachai jaturappattarapong word beating almost didn't work and it's gone out and we've got quarter of an hour gone by and a lot of action three goals to talk about two to thailand one to myanmar and now we even have uh substitution early one saw ba myint has been taken off he hasn't had a good time at the back saw ba myint the sweeper and uh they have changed it to than win this is really a gamble by the coach playing someone to the heart of defence who's only had one game prior to this game easy cross to deal with he wanted something spectacular the substitute than win and after both sides after that word have settle down a little good ball once again by kyi lwin nice movement upfront by myanmar it's not being shown at the moment and perhaps that is where they are missing wyin aung now wyn aung does a lot of the after ball movement surachai surasak easy for the defender there soe moe kyaw an unorthodox word he's playing for noe kyaw because he plays a left mid-field when they're attacking and left back on the defender offside vitoon kijmongkonsak word  offside clearly for that well any three of the players in thai team as starting to line up in today's final played in the merlion cup tournament way back in december and they send really they've re-teamed it for there's a lot of depth in thailand foot in thai football have they not got they own semi-professional leave back home well the only weakness actually you can spot off myanmar's kyi lwin is that he doesn't get back and defend as uh as his good as his attacking players  word aung hung the body of surasak  word  even bury and his way ye htut kyi lwin plays for perak of course in the semi-pro league here he is again oh now that's probably summarises myanmar's uh feel of the moment towards this game a lack of cohesion at the back which is very evident and of course all control and in that time by surachai jaturapattarapong here's myo hlaing win who has been the best player so far a time well shut up by surasak nobody offering support though for surachai and he makes place for the shot he tried to curl it but nobody saw them that was uh an old thai error they're not running it to place and no support up front that was very evident in the semi-final the first half semi-final against indonesia and also in the first half against myanmar in the opening match and that time the same time we saw the old myanmar error of not attacking the player on the ball apichad thaveechalermdit nice little one to play with vitoon exquisitely done there great skill by the number fourteen to bear it off and laid back for apichad who made some nice good running into the penalty box certainly sample something from myanmar there the thais and they could learnt how to defend against there as well myo hlaing he's been trying to prove too much at times myo hlaing win oh poor ball by moe kyaw apichad who has been busy in mid-field natee tongsukkao well that call it his solid defender at their tournament here he is again he's been cleared by than win halfway through this match and thailand are leading by two goals to one all the action coming in the first ten minutes poor finish by tawan sriman and i don't ever remember him having a shot on target rather tournament tawam sriman  word and certainly it's uh myanmar throwing an unfamiliar sight there at the national stadium and not passing the ball around and too word spread out very well and it's contested again on this side the thais will like this the myanmar players really have to go in and attack them and stop the game in mid-field  that's where the thais are winning the battle at the moment department separate the winner and the loser apichad thaveechalermdit soe aung chasing it and thais happy to just toss the ball around defenders three goals to one league they finally lose it what can myanmar do now moe kyaw good play by soe moe kyaw well it's a nice one here by moe kyaw a chance though now for than toe aung who's happy to settle for the corner strangely because there are two players in the box waiting for the all important cut back to the byline
