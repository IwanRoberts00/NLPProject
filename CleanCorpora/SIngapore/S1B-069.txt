doctor ang you said you prepared the preliminary report
sometime after you had seen the accused
""
""
yes my lords
""
""
you have a copy of the report with you
""
""
yes
""
it is dated third of september eighty-seven is it
""
""
have you made extra copies
""
""
no
""
""
i have extra copies my lords
""
these were given to us at the commencement of the trial
""
""
preliminary report one hundred and twenty-six my lords
""
doctor this report was made on the third of september nineteen
eighty-six
""
is that right
""
""
nineteen eighty-seven
""
""
i am sorry nineteen eighty-seven
""
""
yes
""
""
now doctor i would like you to explain the differences between
your initial report p one hundred and twenty-six and the final report that
you tendered p one hundred and eighteen
""
could you point out the differences to me
""
""
i think the only difference the sense of it
""
the only difference was in my first report
""
i commented that he is fit to stand trial
""
that he does not suffer from any mental disorder and fit to stand
trial
""
and at the time of the alleged offence he was not of unsound mind
""
that was the conclusion of my first report because he was going for
trial and that was meant for the first trial for the preliminary inquiry
""
now in this at that point in time i made no mention of him not
suffering from any abnormality of mind because normally i think abnormality
of mind is a decision to be made usually by the court
""
it is not for the psychiatrist to make it out
""
but for this high court trial this seems to be the issue and so i
specifically touched on it
""
so the difference between these two is one i commented
""
fitness to stand trial and not touching not mentioning abnormality
of mind that part of it
""
and on this one i did not mention to stand trial
""
i just talked about no mental illness and not of unsound mind and
no abnormality of mind arising from those conditions
""
so i think in this sense that is the difference
""
the other things the minor things about family history i think
there are some
""
because of course in this trial i have heard more things and i have
incorporated more things
""
they are for two different purposes
""
in fact even when i prepared the first report if it is going to be
a high court trial
""
another report will be submitted
""
""
doctor in your initial report you did not consider the issue
as to whether there was any abnormality of mind of subject the accused
""
""
i did not mention it in the report
""
""
neither did you consider it
""
that's my point
""
""
i considered it but i did not include it in the report
""
as i said the question of abnormality of mind and diminished
responsibility is something to be raised not by the psychiatrist
""
it is a decision to be made by the court
""
""
doctor if you will just confine your answer to my question i
think we can move along quite fast
""
my question is did you consider it at the time when you prepared
the initial report
""
doctor did you consider the issue of abnormality of mind
""
""
of course i had considered but it was not relevant to my
report and i did not include it in my report
""
""
just say you did
""
""
yes i did
""
i did
""
""
in your final report did you also consider the issue of
abnormality of mind
""
""
my final report
""
""
yes
""
""
of course
""
""
you considered it this time and you specifically mentioned
that there was no abnormality of mind
""
""
yes arising from those conditions
""
arising from the rest of the developments and so on
""
""
one essential difference between your initial report and your
final report was that when you prepared the final report p one hundred and
eighteen you had by then the evidence adduced at the trial
""
""
yes my lords
""
""
and you specifically mentioned it in paragraph b of p one
hundred and eighteen
""
""
yes my lords
""
""
now doctor ang at that time when you prepared the preliminary
report
""
on what basis did you consider whether or not there was any
abnormality of mind
""
""
on the basis of the history that he gave me
""
on the basis of the observations of his behaviour
""
his narration of events of what happened from the moment of his own
description of the events until the moment when he tried to shoot himself
""
so i think based on all that in other words on no occasion at no
time was there evidence that he was abnormal arising from all those
conditions
""
i think that was based on my examination of him
""
on what basis
""
on my examination of him and that's my conclusion
""
""
and what he told you was reflected in the clinical notes that
you recorded
""
""
yes the sequence of events and the
""
""
which at no time mentioned anything about the delusion or the
possible delusion that he was a hero in the shanghai bank
""
""
yes there was no mention of it because i know
""
""
just yes or no and then we can go on
""
""
no no
""
""
doctor ang when you prepared the final report twenty-eight of
february
""
by then it had transpired in this court that there was evidence of
the accused's claim to this delusion when he was the hero in shanghai bank
""
""
yes
""
""
by then you would have heard the evidence transpiring in court
for a number of days already
""
""
of what
""
of the delusion
""
""
yes
""
""
that's what he claimed
""
""
yes but you have heard in court
""
""
correct
""
""
this evidence which had been going on for a number of days
already
""
""
i heard this being brought up but then there is the other
evidence from all the other people
""
""
we will come to that doctor but just answer my question
""
""
okay
""
i heard that
""
""
otherwise we will go on for time immemorial
""
isn't it a fact doctor ang that that evidence of the accused's
claim to this delusion had transpired in this court for a number of days
already
""
""
yes it is a fact that he said it
""
that yes i accept that but
""
""
it is a fact that he said it
""
""
that's right
""
""
in examination-in-chief
""
""
yes
""
""
it is a fact that he was cross-examined by my learned friend
""
""
yes
""
""
severely on this point
""
""
yes
""
""
it is a fact that the prosecution had given evidence of his
statement to the investigating officer about his claim doctor ang
""
""
not the delusion that he imagined
""
""
all right that he imagined
""
it was a fact by then that you also had doctor nagulendran's
report about this delusion
""
""
yes
""
""
wouldn't you agree doctor ang that the central issue in this
case is whether or not there was such a delusion
""
""
yes together with the claim that he was suffering i think
from a major depression
""
""
isn't the evidence and the claims the arguments pertaining to
this point the central issue in our case
""
""
yes
""
""
wouldn't you agree doctor ang that perhaps the case turns on
the findings of the court in respect of this issue
""
""
yes
""
""
now that being the case
""
if i may refer you to your own report p one hundred and eighteen
""
you did not even make a single reference to that testimony
""
""
yes i did not make reference to it agreed
""
""
you didn't refer to that at all
""
be it a delusion or imagination or a claim or a fact
""
you made absolutely no reference to that whatsoever in your report
""
""
yes i did not make any reference to it
""
""
in fact doctor in your so-called final report which you
claimed you took into consideration the evidence adduced at the trial
""
you left out this issue which you admit to be central to the
entire proceedings completely out of your report
""
""
i considered it
""
""
i don't care whether you considered
""
did you or did you not leave it out in your report doctor ang
""
""
yes i left it out
""
""
that's all i want you to say
""
doctor ang would you not agree with me that any person not sitting
in this court listening to this trial and has the benefit only of your report
will probably get the impression that no such thing ever transpired in court
""
""
no
""
it would just be that in spite of my having listened to the
evidence which has been adduced in court i had not included it because there
was no evidence
""
""
doctor ang i hadn't asked why you left it out so please
""
""
but i have to explain it
""
""
i will give you more than ample chance to explain doctor ang
""
you'll have the floor
""
my question is very simple
""
you are a very experienced man doctor ang
""
a man's life is at stake
""
a boy's life is at stake doctor ang
""
any person would you not agree with me doctor ang
""
any person not knowing what transpired in court reading your
report will conclude that no such testimony was ever given in this court
""
""
yes
""
""
doctor ang any person who does not know what happened in his
court reading your report will not have the slightest idea that the accused
had given testimony that i was deluded as the hero in shanghai bank
""
""
yes
""
anyone reading it would not have this sort of information yes
""
""
anyone reading this also doctor ang will not know that for
days we were here arguing on this point
""
""
yes but
""
""
please save the but
""
you will have time for your buts
""
doctor ang anybody just reading your report will have no inkling
whatsoever about that point
""
don't you agree with me doctor
""
""
yes
""
i agree fully
""
""
that anybody reading your report would have a serious gap in
the nature of the case and the nature of the evidence and the nature of the
testimony that transpired
""
""
but the outcome of the case is to be decided by the lordships
not by any person reading it
""
""
yes i agree
""
i will come to why you said that
""
but anybody reading this will probably conclude that no such thing
ever happened in this court
""
is it not doctor ang
""
""
yes
""
""
do you think it is fair for you to make a report like this
""
""
no
""
i think the report reflects my opinion on the matter and i'll be
giving evidence in court before the lordships
""
so anything could always be raised
""
""
doctor ang you earlier said that page one hundred and
eighteen reflects your opinion
""
""
yes my conclusions
""
it reflects my conclusions
""
""
on the testimony that was given in court
""
""
yes my lords
""
""
is it fair therefore a central issue to be ignored by you
""
""
i never ignored it
""
it was considered
""
""
ignored in this report doctor ang
""
all i am saying is
""
""
not argued out in the report but it was certainly considered
but i concluded
""
""
but did any person reading this report
""
did you express any opinion on this particular fact
""
""
no
""
it is although not stated
""
but the conclusion covers that aspect of my formulation of my
thinking
""
""
how how how could your conclusion be based on a fact that you
didn't mention
""
""
no these facts had been brought out
""
""
doctor ang explain to us your mental process
""
how you can formulate an opinion without a reference to a fact
""
""
of course the fact that it was not written that the argument
was not set out in the report does not mean that
""
""
it wasn't not argued not set out in the report
""
you described the antecedents and precedents
""
""
that's right
""
in fact very briefly i described i did not go into great details
and i think what matters most was my conclusion and i would be answerable to
the court to explain how i came to such a conclusion
""
now whether a person outside reading it is aware of the whole
proceedings or not i don't think it really matters coomaraswamy:-
""
""
may it please your lordship 
""
now doctor please refer to page three of p one hundred and
eighteen your final report under the heading of antecedents to the incident
""
have you got it
""
""
yes my lord
""
""
doctor by this you meant it is your account as to the events
leading to the incident
""
""
this is a very brief summary of the events leading to it
""
""
brief nevertheless but as far as you were concerned these
were events leading to the incident as you saw it
""
""
yes
""
""
would you agree with me doctor that nowhere in your report
did you mention about the accused taking the two revolvers with him
""
""
yes
""
i left it out
""
in fact this account is based very much on my interview with him
and also probably supplemented by the things i heard in court and also a
little bit of background information i obtained from inspector ng's summary
""
so it is only meant just as an introduction outlining the summary
of events relevant events
""
""
right
""
these were events which you saw as relevant in your summary
""
""
yes
