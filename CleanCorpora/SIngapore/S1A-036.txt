ya
""
i mean it's so thick uh you probably can't tell where the
amendments are made unless you highlight it all

maybe if you could just issue the amended pages you know because i

""
waste of i mean he's a perfectionist lah
""
""

""
ah

""
he did all these all those things by himself
""
""
uhm
""
""
ya lily didn't even know  word 
""
uh
""
""
ya until we went to their new house you see to to for the
meeting then lily was started started telling us
""
because we're asking her what we should do
""
then she started telling us and then the next thing we knew
 word  uh uh he choong keong started distributing all
those
""
""
where are you now brenda
""
still in nus
""
""
yes
""
""
oh
""
""
uhm
""
""
how long will that be
""
""
uh you mean the entire project
""
""
ya
""
""
it will take a number of years
""
""
serious
""
""
serious
""
""
so you will be with it
""
""
not necessarily
""
""
oh
""
""
ya the project itself will  word 
""
""
last for so long
""
""
uhm
""
""
but you don't have to be with it
""
you're not bonded to committed
""
""
no no no it's a one-year contract
""
""
oh
""
""
subject to renewal
""
""
is that
""
i see
""
""
ya
""
have you started looking for other jobs
""
""
me
""
i got an offer but i'm not very keen
""
even before he gave me a firm offer i was really feeling quite
uneasy about the job already
""
""
why
""
""
because when i was quite happy after the first interview but
when they offered me i mean just unofficially
""
they asked me to go down for meeting to discuss the my my no my
period of notice and other terms
""
i found out that they don't even have a hrd
""
""
uh i see
""
""
human resource department ya
""
a lot of things are not properly done so i'm quite hesitant lah
""
started be care feeling hesitant about it and you know to
""
so i i i i want to put it nicely when they offered me the job at a
certain price i quoted
""
i i asked for something much higher
""
""
uhm
""
""
like much higher means uh it's about six more than five
thousand dollars higher
""
""
i see
""
""
ya
""
so i was thinking maybe they'll turn me down immediately you see
but they say they'll think about it
""
then yesterday they call me and tell me they will give me
""
so i said oh oh
""
but the problem was we did we you see they talk so much you know
so much so that when i wanted to ask them certain things uh i didn't have a
chance and then i forgot
""
""
uhm
""
""
ya so you know things like how many months' notice i must
give how many days' annual leave are you giving me and things like that
""
it was not mentioned at all until they called me yesterday
""
i have to give three months' notice
""
i have to i've only get i i'll only be getting fourteen days'
annual leave
""
""
oh
""
""
which is the same as here
""
that's what i was telling him about you see
""
""
uhm
""
""
i'm hoping that i'll get something more unless it's a
five-day week then fourteen days is okay you see
""
""
ya
""
""
then he said oh
""
he qualified lah
""
he said they will be looking into that uh in the following in the
next one year because they are thinking of coming up with some company policy
""
but the that's not a promise you see
""
""
uhm
""
""
so i was very hesitant so i told him i need to think think
about it
""
then he was quite surprised because it so happened that yesterday
morning i received a call from another application another letter company
that i wrote to
""
and they asked me to go down for interview on monday
""
so initially i i saw like i was i was not sure whether i wanted to
oops oh dear
""
so i just took a number i told them i'll call them if i want to go
down for interview
""
then after i spoke to this guy uh i decided to try another job
""
""
oh
""
""
so i'll be going for interview on monday
""
i didn't really feel very peaceful about it lah so i don't want
""
but i didn't tell him no straightaway
""
i told him i'll think about it
""
then i told him actually i'm considering other offers
""
my main concern is if my present employer can promote me this july
i'll stay
""
i'm waiting for a word from them only
""
""
oh
""
""
i've already spoken to them so i'm waiting for them
""
""
do we alight
""
""
you mean here uh
""
not here right
""
can we alight
""
""
how come they don't have a you know taxi stand or something
""
""
taxi
""
ya lor
""
""
 word  so hot
""
perspiring you know
""
""
ya
""
""
then this jo said wei tze your whole back is wet
""
i said i'm not immune to this weather  word  ya
ya
""
you may stay here for one hundred years and you cannot be immune
to it and still be subject to all the heat and all that
""
jo is very funny
""
she was late so she couldn't go to lily's house to meet us
""
""
uhm
""
""
so she called up to say that she'll meet us at the botanic
gardens
""
""
uhm
""
""
and when we went there we were late so she was furious
""
she say she took the cab to one entrance and she waited and waited
""
she says she'll be there before eight
""
""
uhm
""
""
we got there at eight-thirty you see and then she walked from
that entrance to that entrance
""
it so happened that when she got when she got to the other
entrance we just arrived
""
we just passed by so we saw her we stopped the car picked her up
""
she was so furious she went into the car she made so much noise
""
the whole car was so noisy
""
ya and then that driver was so cute
""
the driver is very chatty you see
""
she kept asking her uh jo uh i'm uh don't know i can't remember
how he introduced himself by another curt way you see
""
then after that jo ignored him you know
""
she continued making noise ya and then he asked her are you cold
cool already
""
""
have you all got cards
""
""
ya i got card
""
""
do you have more than one handbag
""
""

""
""

""

""
""

""
""

some cleanser thing
""
i kept the whole thing in the cupboard
""
i don't know whether if i remember next time i remember the
cleanser i take it out whether it'll still be okay

it will lost the shape you see  word  : it's nice
""
""
the towel was very nice
""
it has got such things you know
""
""
and they actually managed to print it in the same logo uh
with the the  word  and the heart there right
""
""
ah ya
""
""
uhm
""
""
i think so
""
i think it's not easy you know
""
it's probably through contact lah
""
probably they have contacts
""
""
uhm
""
""
get it at cost price
""
'cos this lee peng asked them how much it cost
""
then jo said how can you ask that kind of thing
""
then lily said oh i got it at cost price
""
""
it's quite crowded here  word 
""
""
but it's so far
""
this is much more lighter
""
ah  word  yes
""
""
are you okay
""
you
""
cough when you  word  you start coughing when
you're in an air-con place
""
""
uhm
""
""
so how about this place
""
""
can't be helped too
""
""
oh dear
""
it's a long distance
""
you get ticklish is it
""
""
uhm
""
""
next time must bring a tumbler of water
""
""
fishermen
""
""
ya fisherman
""
that's what i use it for you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
i get i get this problem every now and then
""
""
oh really
""
""
ya so actually i don't like to eat it because like just now
before when the reception start started uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
i was coughing  word  i said oh 
word  because i need to help them
""
so i just pop one into my mouth
""
the moment i popped in within one minute i started sneezing
""
it's too strong
""
""
but what kind of positions are all your offers about
""
""
oh my the one that offer that i want  word
 was uhm an accountant's  word  but it's head of
accounts department
""
""
uhm
""
""
the department has got about six seven seven or eight staff
lah
""
""
uhm
""
""
the job will be finance and admin
""
then this one that i'm going to is finance and admin manager
""
""
uhm
""
""
but i felt it's a small company
""
have you heard of this company called pan pacific publish
publication
""
""
ya of course
""
""
uh of course why
""
""
 word 
""
""
ya
""
""
ya but what do you all know about that
""
i'm going there for the interview
""
""
i don't know
""
""
just know it as a publisher
""
""
ya i i heard of it as a publication company but i don't know
much
""
ah but i'll go and see uh
""
""
actually what is the main reason for you to
""
""
oh the main reason is my boss lah
""
ya because last time i was quite comfortable you see whatever job
she gave me even things that you know she was too busy to do
""
i mean she didn't want to do she just gave it to me taxation the
whole group's taxation  word  you see
""
it's now by the taxation bank just check feedback in instruction
to carry on uh
""
i did  word  reports
""
at the time i  word  my my boss already did not
give me a lot of work that without inform me about the kind of work she is
doing
""
there the work that she should coach me while  word
 
""
right from the beginning i was  word 
assisting meaning when whenever she's not around i have to do what she is
doing
""
but she's never prepared me she's never informed me or never done
anything to inform me of what she's doing and ya so i i mean i was quite
happy because i was very busy
""
i didn't want to take on whatever lah
""
then when we put in the  word  report in last
year i was quite busy so i said i i believe at that time i started having
 word  because of  word 
""
but it i was  word  because i was doing the
release doing petrol data
""
i was quite unhappy about it lah but i took it as a chance for me
to uhm to get hands-on experience of the system lah so that it'll give me
it'll help me to supervise the staff you see
""
""
uhm
""
""
more effectively and then she went on maternity leave
""
before she went i was so worried you know because i knew that a
lot of work she did i'll never i'll never be able to handle
""
""
uhm
""
""
just worried that there'll be a lot of  word
 to do
""
she just went off
""
one week before she went off she started telling me about what
report that she gave but that was  word  what you have
been doing for the whole year you know
""
so she went off suddenly because her  word 
burst you see
""
oh then had to open her drawers everyday look through all her
things
""
she's very messy you see her things and find out what's going on
""
there are certain things that she filed very nice very
systematically so she  word 
""
ya but it was terrible i had a very hard time
""
i worked so late and then and then then she after that just
before she went she mentioned a couple of times oh by the time i come back
they probably don't need me any more
""
you can easily do my job
""
that to me i took it very naturally lah that no  word
 i mean i don't feel i'll be able to do as good a job as you 
""
