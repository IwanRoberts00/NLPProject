it's the uhm latest 32 bit operating system from microsoft which will offer you both uh the power and reliability but more importantly it is an open operating system that is uhm scalable with hardware and portable across multiple platform uhm in microsoft we have this internal rating of our product uhm that is we have products that we develop that we think they are real cool and we have products that we think that they are way cool but for windows nt we think they are absolutely awesome okay we are we are really thrilled with the roll out plan of windows nt and particularly with the broad industries report behind windows nt that you will get to see when i present my charts itself okay so in the next uh thirty minutes or so i'll like to be able to just go through an overview of windows nt so that you know uh what windows nt is all about what are the benefits it brings to you and hopefully it'll be it will excite you enough to make sure that you come to my uh windows nt launch which is in a couple of months so stay tune and look out for the uh the press release or or the announcement of the launch first i'll like to just share with you what is microsoft system strategy and what is our key objective one we really want to build the windows uh fam into a family of products you are quite well aware of today that windows 3.1 is in fact the defacto standard it's selling more than a million copies per month so what and and it is primarily being uh uh available uh or being run on on a desktop environment itself so what we what to do is really to extend windows nt's family uh or rather windows family to reach the corporate mission critical computing environment and also reach downwards to non pc devices such as office and consuming uh consumer environment which you will a lot about it in a couple of months so if you will this is really a uh graphical representation of our system strategy okay and uh there are various options by which we could uhm uhm consider in implementing our win fab windows family of products one is that we're going to have taken a one size fit all kind of approach whereby uh we build one implementation of windows and making sure it address all the requirements of the user or the another approach is what uh is is to build a single uh architecture such word such that it provide a very consistent look and feel a very consistent programming model and also a ability to provide assistance uh consistent underlying network uh technology so that the idea is that you can have a single architecture but you can implement new technology in the various uhm uh implement it in various ways such that it will address all the various specific users' needs okay so we have adopted the latter approach and we think it is a uh unique approach in the market place word  given the ability to spend windows nt of products from all the way notebook pen-computing and all the way to a risc work station and symmetric multi-processing environment itself to the windows family of products includes windows 3.1 windows workbook nt windows nt and even the advance server they are all complementary products and are not meant to replace one another itself so if you look at windows and windows workgroup it is primarily uhm a the desktop application arena where it focus on the individual pc user uh enhancing its productivity and being the mainline business application for the user itself whereas windows nt is directly a super set of windows 3.1 or windows for workbook if you will okay it is really targeted at the business and technical computing environment it is designed to the client server uh a client server is designed to the client server operating system providing a high level of uh functionality and robustness in the operating system so that its needs is very targeted on the inset itself okay so what are some of the design goals when we started the windows nt we wanted it to be a small true 32-bit multi-tasking operating system based upon the microkerner uh design okay that it has to be portable across intel and the risc platform and it will have to support multiple subsystem such as dos win 16 win 32 posix os 2 right and it also has to support the very the merging multiprocessing uh environment itself and finally huge capacities because we're talking about business and the technical computing environment since we started our we held our first uh windows nt 32 developers conference in san francisco the momentum for windows nt is just tremendous and i just want to take a few moments to go through a couple of charts to tell you what where are where are the industry support what are industry talking about it okay uhm we have managed to ship about sixty thousands sd case which are software development kit uh within seven months from the day we uh had the uh windows developer conference in san francisco and we have about four hun four thousand corporate customers worldwide evaluating windows nt today and i and that number is going to go up to twenty thousand with a word with a much later and in fact the book inside windows nt and if some of you have attended uh the lucky three hundred customers who attended my windows nt corporate preview in march you might have a copy of this book in fact it has been the number two uh in the computer book uh best selling list in fact it outsell the famous book by madonna itself and uh we have just recently completed a survey uhm we did a random uh sample of the people at that time who have purchased the software development kit to find out who they are and what they are intending to do with it cause that that is important to us as well as for our customer itself and we find that eighty three per cent of the guys who actually bought it are developer so that's good news and ten per cent of these guys are con consultants and seven per cent of them are end user and when we ask what they were going to do with the developer kit twenty-one per cent said they were actually going to develop applications for resell alright twenty-seven said it was for internal use and eighteen per cent for consulting customers uhm obviously it's going to be a a formable forth in an environment and consultants have to know how to consul how to implement for their customers in consultancy area and four per cent of that data be for personal use but more but more interesting is this chart and i do apologise for it being very wordy and actually not very clear it's not very sharp uhm about three thousand developer says that they going have us develop more than nine thousand retail windows application nt applications within the next twelve months excuse me and that's a lot of application uh on windows nt to be available as it roll out uh in in the next couple of months and fifty-seven per cent of these developers said they in fact are developing windows nt application for mission critical line and business applications this is exactly what we have targeted it for and it's and we are develop developing mission critical line and bi business application for windows nt and sixty-nine per cent of the new windows nt application in fact is designed in a client server environment and twenty-five per cent of developers are actually beginning to port unix mbs and even bms application uh onto windows nt itself there are a lot of developer too tools available today seventy plus of them and you see a lot more being available as the product being rolled out but what is really interesting to find is that leading mainframe tool vendors like computer associate word knowledge ware these guys are porting their tools on windows nt and think about if you are a corporate uh or mis developer you're so used to using these tools and we have the same tools running on windows nt and that would really facilitate your effort in uh trying to develop client server application itself so who would want windows nt definitely the windows power users by that we mean these are the people uhm who who will buy the the fastest and the greatest in technology they will usually be the first adopter and they very often  word play a role as a window as a leader in the windows community itself so we certainly think that the windows power user will will be out there to grab for windows nt mis and business solution builders definitely uh where their role is past the developing application for their organisation or for their customers windows nt will definitely provide a very uh robust environment for which they can deploy solution for customers or for themselves their own organisation advance business application users these are the guys that is probably running a claims processing application in insurance industry or it could be a banking application or an order processing application and these guys can actually run all these word  application of windows nt given that it's a very secure environment developers definitely our target uhm you've seen with the anti-clave a lot of developers are in fact developing applications for windows nt and finally the engineering and uh technical users so wherever they are a cad/cam designer for a automative or a airline uhm industry they certainly will be able to use windows nt because there are a lot of the uh leading cad/cam software vendors today are porting their application to windows nt and one of these examples is intergraph in fact they they gonna port quite a complete suite of their products to windows nt itself so what is windows nt it has a core set of features okay and uhm one of the first and foremost one of the most important asset that you will able to uhm uh uh to to advantage is that the fact that windows nt is windows okay so whether you're running a windows application or looks like windows and so forth it is windows it is that user interface that you you've grown to use uh all this while and grown to love okay in addition it will also have provides you with scaleable power security reliability easy management compatibility with a lot of the variety of systems that is available today and most importantly an open platform for a lot of third party innovations itself and we'll go into some of these in details uhm uhm in this couple of charts windows nt is windows so it won't within some uh common function as in windows and that's typically that it is going to be easy to use you act you can see windows nt being demonstrated behind the room it is exactly like the windows interface data workend so there is very little uhm uhm time needed in uh learning to use the system all you need to want to be concern with is how do i use my application cause that's what you want the system do for you not learn a new operating system that has that require you to learn to to go through a new and to rethink so this a very logical migration for someone who has been used to windows environment sit on the windows nt and start being productive of their system today we certainly have a a a a very uh rich set of applications today that's already on windows 3.1 and this set of applications will run on windows nt  the last three points are really uh fundamental addition to the windows platform of products which will begin to see as a consistent functionality that were prevalent in the whole suite of windows family of products that is uh basically the botian networking so as you buy windows nt you could actually be able to do a peer to peer networking with your colleagues sharing files uh and printers and also email each other okay
