under his massive four-year economic plan to revive the us
economy bill clinton aims to reduce the budget deficit by some us five
hundred billion dollars over the next five years
""
at the same time he plans tax increases totally some two hundred and
forty-seven billion dollars and spending cuts of close to a quarter trillion
dollars
""
tax increases will come mainly by way of increasing the corporate
tax rate from thirty-four per cent to thirty-six per cent
""
the top rate on personal income too has been raised by five per cent
""
individuals with annual income of above us hundred and fifteen
thousand will be taxed at thirty-six per cent
""
and for those earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars an additional ten per cent tax surcharge
""
bill clinton plans to cut spending by a little over us two hundred
and fifty billion dollars cuts specifically targeted at the defence
department streamlining government agencies and domestic programmes like
health and human services
""
but he also plans to increase spending by some hundred and sixty
billion dollars over four years
""
this will go towards basic infrastructure like roads and highways
""
he also plans to spend some us sixteen billion dollars as part of
his short term stimulus package to revive the us economy
""
the us congress has so far approved bill clinton's four year
economic plan in principle at least
""
but squabbling over spending cuts goes on between the democrats and
the republicans
""
clinton has agreed to cut spending by an additional us fifty-five
billion dollars between nineteen ninety-four and ninety-eight
""
but the republicans want more cuts and less taxes
""
but while the bickering goes on in washington it's bill clinton's
short terms stimulus package that is attracting most attention
""
bill clinton wants to inject the additional sixteen billion dollars
in spending to strengthen the economy
""
although the economy has picked itself out of recession and grown
by a staggering four point eight per cent in the last quarter of nineteen
ninety-two he feels that the recovery is still weak
""
but not everyone agrees
""
but there are others who don't think that the huge budget deficit
should be an issue
""
bill clinton plans to spend the sixteen billion dollars on building
basic infrastructure like roads highways and schools
""
this so as to put as many people as possible back to work
""
unless previous occasions when the us economy was recovering from a
recession this time around employment level in the us doesn't seem to be
picking up
""
in every period after recessions since the late sixties employment
shot up above pre-recession levels
""
not this time
""
in fact whatever jobs that are created are not terribly significant
""
in fact real average hourly earnings in the united states have been
falling since the seventies
""
from a high of nine dollars in nineteen seventy-three to a little
more than seven fifty today
""
so not only are the consumers' purchasing power been deteriorating
so have their confidence
""
the us is heavily dependent on its consumer spending to keep its
economy growing and the fact that it's a whopping us six trillion dollar
economy there are doubts as to how much of a difference the extra sixteen
billions in spending will make 
""
""
""
surrounded by wire and wall the prison is much more than just
a physical separation from the outside world
""
deep in the bowels of this prison over two thousand inmates are
locked away for crimes like rape robbery and murder
""
most of these offenders are kept here for an average of five to
twenty years as punishment prevention and hopefully rehabilitation
""
here contact with the outside is kept to a minimum
""
newspapers and magazines have articles about violence drugs and
jail riots blank out
""
television programmes are also censored
""
prisoners are allowed only three hours of viewing time a day
""
every facet of prison life is governed by rules
""
rules that cannot be broken
""
prisoners know that they are always being monitored through a
system of charts colours and codes
""
and out this experience each will emerge to tell a different story
""
twenty-eight year old johnny tan was a teenage gangster
""
his red collar is a constant reminder that he is in prison lingo a
lifer
""
and this means that his sentence is twenty years but with remission
he only has to serve two-thirds of it
""
the blue stripes on his uniform indicate that he's on special watch
meaning he's monitored every minute of the day
""
and johnny has lived this way for the pass ten years since he was
arrested on charges on rape and robbery
""
within the confines of the four walls there is nothing but time
time to think time to change
""
on hindsight johnny blames his violent criminal activities on his
youth and as things  word  started to take control of his
life
""
overnight the teenager grew up
""
at first glance it may appear that the women's prison is less harsh
""
but the little touches only attempt to hide the sombre reality for
some two hundred pillow inmates housed here
""
three times a day the women have to sit in rows to be counted
""
this is called the master check
""
thirty-eight year old lim swee fang is used to this
""
she has been here for the past eleven years
""
since swee fang was arrested on a drugs charge life has gone by in
slow motion far from the bright lights and busy streets of orchard road where
she used to work as a hairdresser
""
in prison swee fang has learnt to live without many things
""
in the small cell she shares with five other inmates there is
little space and even less privacy
""
but improvements are expected with the move to the new premises
next year
""
then inmates will get more facilities like toilets
""
but there'll still be rations
""
underwear will be exchanged once in three months and basics like
soap once a month
""
today swee fang has learnt to savour the little things like yard
time
""
while this is a daily two-hour routine for male prisoners female
inmates are allowed yard time only twice a week for forty-five minutes each
""
for swee fang it's the chance to escape from the gloomy depth of
the prison even only for a while
""
for her yard time is the luxury
""
other luxuries come in plastic bags every thursday
""
this is canteen day when prisoners will get a chance to spend half
their pay on little extras
""
the most popular items are biscuits cigarettes and canned food
""
because the precious canteen items may be used as mediums of
exchange in prison inmates are not allowed to keep their purchases for more
than a week
""
inmates are also not allowed to share their purchases
""
even for those inside there may have been a time when such strict
rules about the cheap canteen items would have been laughable a time when
eating food off plastic trays would have been unthinkable
""
for joe david that was the time before prison
""
joe was a successful businessman earning over twenty thousand
dollars a month when he was arrested for cheating
""
today he earns very much less and sometimes ends up spending half
his prison pay on a can of margarine
""
at nights joe sleeps on a wooden bunk bunk number four b alongside
some eighty other inmates
""
he also shares a communal bathroom and as far as possible he wants
to be known as just another inmate
""
he tries not to let anyone know that he is a professional with an
mba a white-collar criminal
""
and joe recently got a taste of it when he started work in the
prison library
""
according to him the other white-collar criminals were envious when
he got the job apparently the most coveted one among the professional
fraternity here
""
but for joe the simple job is merely a chance to remind himself of
who he was and who he is now within the walls and bars
""
the prison is like a large pot of unwilling participants with a mix
of races ages backgrounds and personalities
""
and within the confines of the prison walls there is often no
choice but to integrate
""
yet most of the friendships formed in prison are superficial mostly
to pass the time to fit in
""
and even on occasions where real friendships do form ties are
difficult to maintain when one leaves prison
""
as a rule ex-prisoners are not allowed to return to visit their
friends left behind
""
there are also inmates who are weary about forming bonds with
fellow criminals
""
forty-five year old goh boon hock is one of them
""
he has been in and out of prison all his life
""
a compulsive gambler boon hock made a habit of stealing to pay off
his debts
""
this is his eighth conviction
""
he knows what to expect and prefers not to take the risk of forming
bonds in prison
""
every night boon hock goes through a ritual of folding five
cigarettes and smoking them
""
it is his treat for the day something he enjoys in the quiet
solitude of his cell
""
and for the moment boon hock feels safe and content in his little
cocoon so much so that he has even gone a step further and cut off all ties
with the outside world
""
he told his wife to stop visiting him after the fifth year
""
with no ties the pain the worry and fear of separation disappear
almost magically
""
many have discovered this cure especially those with long sentences
""
boon hock still has six years left to serve of his sixteen years
sentence for armed robbery
""
for him it's easier to ignore the outside until he has to face it
eventually
""
but for many others the outside remains too powerful a force to
ignore
""
for them the outside is the only real world and prison is only a
temporary interruption of that real world a world which comes to them only on
visiting day
""
each prisoner is allowed two visits a month and sometimes due to
the large numbers visitors may have to wait awhile for their turn at the
meeting table
""
here separated by a screen they come together for a quick but
precious twenty-minute visit
""
it is difficult to condense two weeks of news into that time and
the frustration of this usually shows as the years go by
""
and sometimes meetings are bittersweet
""
but johnny is lucky
""
after ten years he still gets regular visits thanks in part to his
close relationship with his family before his imprisonment
""
but maintaining ties with the outside world is not easy in any
case
""
during joe's first stint in prison his wife left him under the
strain
""
when he was in prison this time around his new wife stood by him
but it did not make it any easily on his two children
""
they can only visit him during the school holidays
""
he had admits that it is especially difficult to keep up ties with
the younger child who does not understand why he can only see dad for a few
minutes a time
""
for swee fang the experience was even more painful
""
her daughter was only three and her son seven when she was in
prison
""
she did not see them for the first three years and when they
finally came her daughter could not recognise her
""
after visits swee fang sometimes goes back to reread her pile of
letters
""
prisoners are allowed to receive as many letters they like but
they're only allowed to send out two a month
""
by the time the letters are censored the news may be stale but
they fill in gaps left behind by short visits providing words of
encouragement
""
swee fang has also amass a stack of postcards
""
she has received over a hundred just this year alone
""
these cards help keep swee fang in touch with changes on the
outside showing her her parts of singapore she has never seen before like
changi airport the mrt and even sentosa
""
in whatever form these links to the outside world are very
important to inmate 
""
it assures them that they are not forgotten that they are still
part of the family that they are still a part of the real world
