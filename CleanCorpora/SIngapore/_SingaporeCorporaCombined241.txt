your honour the findings the appeal that's before your honour here is essentially an appeal on the finding of fact made by the learned trial judge after hearing witnesses your honour i wish to take your honour very quickly to the principles on which an appellate court acts in reviewing a finding of fact and your honour these cases are referred to in my skeletal arguments the first i would refer your honour to is a case of colonial securities trust company limited versus massey and others that appears your honour at my bundle of authorities filed in respect of civil appeal number one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven that's the first case at page one i refer your honour to the headnotes it says that where a case tried by a judge without a jury comes before the court of appeal that court will presume that the decision of the judge on the facts was right and will not disturb it unless the appellant satisfactorily makes out that it was wrong your honour in this very short headnote your honour there is your honour will notice a presumption that the decision of a judge on a finding of facts was correct and secondly your honour that there is always this onus thrust upon the appellant to show that he was wrong your honour having said that i refer your honour to the second case and that's at page two of my skeletal arguments it's found at page five of the bundle of authorities that's the decision of montgomery and company limited versus wallace james your honour the facts basically in the montgomery case was an action by the plaintiff respondent in which she raised an action for interdict i believe that is the action more or less akin to an action for an injunction against the defendant appellants and other persons encroaching on a strip of ground consisting of a few yards in length and breadth situated on a edge of the river on the plea that this ground in question had from time immemorial been dedicated to the use of herself and the inhabitants for the purpose of recreation and amusement and the bleaching and dry of clothes so it essentially your honour was the issue in question was whether there was this user and whether it was established if it was she would have succeeded your honour the house of lords in this case held and found as a fact that this ground had from time immemorial been and had not been dedicated for the use as here described your honour i would refer to the decision of the earl of halsbury at page seven in which he sets out the principles which will be relevant in my submissions in this case at page seven the earl of halsbury l c said this my lord i think this appeal should be allowed it is simply a question of fact and doubtless where a question of fact has been decided by a tribunal which has seen and heard the witnesses the greatest weight ought to be attached to the finding of such a tribunal it has had the opportunity of observing the demeanor of the witnesses and judging of their veracity and accuracy in a way that no appellate court can have but where no question arises as to truthfulness and where the question is as to the proper inferences to be drawn from truthful evidence then the original tribunal is in no better position to decide than the judges of an appellate court your honour stopping here the emphasis your honour i would draw is the distinction between truthfulness truthful evidence your honour and in this case though as i have said it is simply a question of fact i do not think it is necessary to discredit a single witness in the sense of imputing to him willful untruth there are some differences between the two sets of witnesses though i think not very much on any questions which depends on the personal recollection of the witnesses and three lines down your honour he says but i give credit to the honest desire of all the witnesses to give an accurate view of the fitting?? as they themselves saw it so your honour the house of lords in that case drew a distinction in an appeal an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge if there is no question of untruthful evidence where truth has been established and rightly so in the facts of the montgomery case because we have in that case two different sets of witnesses both trying to tell the court what they saw over a long period of time there was no question of any untruthfulness they were merely relating to the court what were their personal experiences what they saw over a period of time unlike your honour in this case where both the appellant and the respondent were in control of their vehicles it was the case it was either you or i who was responsible for the accident and your honour it's my respectful submission your honour that there is a distinction truthful evidence is in issue in this case your honour if i may again refer your honour to the next case and that is the case of powell and wife versus treakin menon nursing?? now in that case it's at page forty-four of my bundle of authorities it is page forty-four your honour this was a case by a husband and wife against the nursing home for negligence causing injuries to the wife at the first instance your honour the trial judge held and allowed the plaintiff's claim in the court of appeal the defendants succeeded the house of lords your honour reverse the decision of the court of appeal and affirmed the decision of the trial judge your honour again the observations made by that court are relevant to the present proceedings i would refer your honour to page fifty at page fifty the decision the judgment of viscount selkie l c seven lines from the bottom your honour he says that on an appeal against a judgement of a judge sitting alone the court of appeal will not set aside the judgment unless the appellant satisfies the court that the judge was wrong and that his decision ought to have been the other way where there has been a conflict of evidence your honour the court of appeal will have special regard to the fact that the judge saw the witnesses and he refers to the case of clark versus edinburgh tramways where it was said that when a judge hears and see witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence that judgment is entitled to great respect and that quite and your honour i place emphasis on this quite irrespective of whether the judge makes any observation with regard to credibility or not there is no need your honour for a trial judge to say i think that this witness is incredible he is a liar there is no need for that your honour it goes on to say i can of course quite understand a court of appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in which the judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses having seen and heard them and does not believe another but that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a court of justice in courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more evenly divided witnesses without any conscious bias towards the conclusion may have in their demeanor in their manner in their hesitation in their nuance of their expression in even the turns of the eye-lids left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page what in such circumstances thus psychologically put is the duty of an appellate court in my opinion the duty of an appellate court in those circumstances is for each judge of it to put to himself as i now do in this case the question am i who sit here without those advantages sometimes broad and sometimes subtle which are the privilege of the judge who heard and tried the case in the position not having those privileges to come to a clear conclusion that the judge who had them was plainly wrong if i cannot be satisfied in my mind that the judge with those privileges was plainly wrong then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment again very quickly your honour i would also refer to page fifty-two your honour and that is somewhere in the middle third-quarter of the page just before the end of penultimate paragraph of his judgment he said having regard to the facts it is in my view quite impossible to say that the learned judge was wrong in coming to the conclusion he arrived at in favour of the plaintiff so your honour there is essentially a difficult task on the part of appellant in a case such where a finding of fact is involved and more so in the case of an accident your honour the next part of the judgment is at page fifty-six your honour and that is the decision of lord atkin i shan't take your honour longer on this case except to refer to page fifty-six and to say that and to refer to the decision i wish to express my concurrence in the view that on appeals from the decision of a judge sitting without a jury the jurisdiction of the court of appeal is free and unrestricted the court has to re-hear in other words has the same right to come to decisions on the issues of facts as well as law as the trial judge but the court is still a court of appeal and in exercising its functions is subject to the inevitable qualifications of that position it must recognise the onus upon the appellant to satisfy that the decision below is wrong it must recognise the essential advantage of the trial judge in seeing the witnesses and watching their demeanor in cases which turn on the conflicting testimony of witnesses and the belief to be reposed in them an appellate court can never recapture the initial advantage of the judge who saw and believed and in no cases should this advantage be more readily recognised than in cases which involve character and reputation and your honour the judge concluded lord atkin again at the bottom of this page he says that i have has your honour got that i have not tried to form any opinion as to what judgment i should have given if i had seen the witnesses myself there is no need for your honour to ask yourself what would i have decided your honour the onus is always on the appellant if he cannot discharge the onus to show that the judge was wrong he fails your honour the next case which i would refer to i would skip case d and that's a decision of watt versus thomas that's been referred to by my learned friend it essentially says the same thing but i would refer your honour to the last case which i have in my skeletal arguments and that's the decision of benlax versus austin motor at page seventy-seven of my bundle your honour this case i believe is a case which has been relied upon heavily by my learned friend that the court drew a distinction between the evaluation and perception of facts your honour and the facts in this case your honour concern the existence of an inventive step whether or not a certain pattern was valid your honour the relevant parts which i would quote your honour is at page seventy-eight and that's the decision or viscount simmons  at the last paragraph your honour somewhere third line from the top where he says after reviewing the previous authorities he says but i cannot help thinking that some confusion may have arisen from failure to distinguish between the finding of a specific fact and the finding of fact which is really an inference from facts specifically found my learned friend has sought to argue that what the trial judge did was an inference not of specific facts but merely on what he would say inferential findings but your honour viscount simmons himself drew a distinction and he referred to a case concerning negligence on the part of the defendant when he says that it first must be as determined whether the defendant in fact did and secondly whether what he did amounted in the circumstances to negligence
