they tend to have an over dependence on randy lai which is very very well shackle by gerard danker he certainly think word also good running to teck lan he is left and a great chance now for singapore good break mohammad noor going all the way through it is saved somehow it manages to word vijayan dangerous play by singapore i just for a minute it looked as though mohammad noor aram had weaved his way through for singapore's fourth and his second it wasn't to be a mad in a mad scramble indonesians got is cleared singapore get a penalty corner and at the same time i think we are gonna have a break of play right now one of the indonesians is down injured he is out of the picture at the moment there he is he is just coming in on the onto your screen it is not clear what exactly happened i suppose the picture tells the whole story tayers tobarick the player who has gone down and it looks like a cramp the high intensity of the game i think uh some of players who have by now want to feel some cramps creeping into them well you did say a bit earlier ranjid that the indonesians were slowing down a little and having over dependence on certain players matthais is one of them actually but if we lose him it is going to be a blow unless see what singapore can do they showed a corner they didn't do too much in the first half very unimpressive let's see whether they can improve that a shot there by ibrahim back to steve yes there it is well worth this time good in the nineteenth minute of this second half singapore go four one up and we will see the replay well the initial shot was blocked but it was well played back well taken shot by rosli and it was rosli ahmad who somehow found his way into the dee into the dee all the way from his right back positions it actually shows the determination of the singapore players actually bertrand hah to get into the action it does or perhaps rosli was one of the uh key players on the short corner short corners edwin trying to make his way around got the support of mat noor mat noor will take a shot sixteen yard it says there by no long corner for singapore good try by mohammad noor he got his angles a bit wrong his body was shaped the wrong way and as a result he couldn't get the shot on target but if you don't shot you are never gonna score so it is encouraging to see the singapore players here is dali again going all way and edwin just too wide and edwin throws his stick down in disgust that should have been a goal actually edwin did very well to turn his body around and put it pass the left post and indonesia just can't get out of their own half at the moment singapore mid-field has really taken a strangle hold on this game actually they are playing brilliantly in the mid-field this is a good run though excellent run a chance for indonesia great play by sunny well played there by eugene  word by gerard danker that gives indonesia a short corner that was a great save by sunny and a one on one indonesian player was rusmana number eight who managed to weave his way into the dee he had randy lai free on the left side but he decided to go for the goal and sunny pulled off a great save singapore defenders too quick off the mark this short corner is gonna be retaken and randy lai is poised to take a shot good stop andy takes it stopped by razah well played by razah good touch on by vijan to deny the indonesian captain a chance danger has passed temporarily well played by randy lai obstruction says the umpire it is a penalty corner for indonesia again i think that was good play by gerard danker because randy lai was lining up the shot he didn't have much of a choice he had to step in very well put bertrand let's see if indonesia can do something out of this short corner once again rosdi ahmad too fast faster than the pusher good hit there by randy randy just off the right post sunny was all stretched out afraid word by dali to keep that ball in he has given it to ranjid going back to daljid they have to make their way down the right indonesians will put it to crutch for a free lead to singapore singapore coach graham worth intending to give all players some match experience giving alman koo which word for foo yong guan a run of the game well played by ranjid on a bout word turn and he gets a short corner he will only drop his stick ranji he might have got a penalty stroke well not very likely on that who cares he tried his best but he showed good stick work though singapore is a bit not too good in the short corner department it has stopped good push short corner edwin has got the ball out to ranjid pretty well he is only the hitter suppose to he seem a bit slow in stopping and pushing the ball into the dee ibrahim teklan and it would be a shot at goal great big shot there ibrahim teklan unstoppable but umpire's uh not giving the goal because uh dangerous dangerous play and he did not sound the ball so hard luck to ibrahim but a good shot there though here we see a replay of it tremendous shot look at the power in there right in disallowed for dangerous play singapore using the rollick substitution as their  word pullers good dummy by gerard danker he left it for ibrahim knowing there was no indonesian player in the singapore half this's tah lock it's a break on indonesia the indonesians stopped there by ibrahim he gets a free hit just outside the dee he want to take a shot at goal stopped by rosli this time great stop by rosli at point blank word  the number of times the break out word  they have to use eugene who's overlapping who has held it up now azak sending it out to ranjid ranjid umpire has given a long corner to singapore ranjid takes it to ranjid dropped by ranjid in the sixteen yard hit good defence play by indonesians free hit to singapore will be taken by ranjid singh the police he looks for the top man and he finds mohammad noor well shot his second goal for singapore very good goal free hit laid in good stop by mohammad noor kept his eye on the ball and drilled in an excellent excellent shot the thing about that shot is betrand that he kept his eye on the ball and that was very good of mohammad noor brilliant goal it's taken singapore is fifth vijay trying to play word gets a long corner vijay sends his cross and he finds one of the word  of the day indonesian defenders and singapore end up getting a penalty corner and we have five minutes left and with this lead of five to one the silver medal at least looks assured yes bertrand at this stage right now i think silver medal since hockey will there for men's hockey there'll be only two medals gold and silver looks like singapore will end up with a silver good play there nice tactic indonesians read it unless of course singapore can beat malaysian which right now i don't think many people do expect that uh not not at the world's ranking of malaysia at number nine in the world after the olympics and what more but one never knows bertrand the ball is round like they say malaysia obviously be the favourites but given the home ground advantage and what support we can get from the crowd a draw might be enough i mean think about it a draw with malaysia and if somehow the indonesians can fend off the malaysians those difference might be the key of course the question is whether five one is enough because malaysia obviously they're a much sharper team and could well wreck up a much bigger score against indonesians good play there by word hassan he's pulled it a bit too wide bring the ball out indonesians looked like all finished but uh they might want to try to put in a goal to save some credibility and it was ibrahim teklan again to the rescue caught in between the legs ranjid the indonesians might try and wanna look for a goal right now to save some indonesians playing the ball around not knowing what to do as singapore has got everybody back ibrahim now onto the captain's suranto word  well played ibrahim startled suranto suranto still with the ball  word singh on him bit of a stick tapping there indonesians will pick up the free hit well played talop to read that one word  suhanto now well cut off there by razar word try to keep the ball in play not successful suhanto again he trying to the cross in and give a long corner to indonesia good play by danker all the way down to the indonesian half maybe a hit in for indonesia good play by razak ranjid has it on the right now razak's just thrown the ball wide on the right nobody picking it up he's got back the ball trying to put the reverse touch ranjid letting it go out of play sending sends it to eugene eugene trying his way trying to word his round into the dee and there is the horn for the full-time whistle singapore wrapping up a very impressive five one victory goals by gavin dan royan ranjid singh uh two by mohammud noor adam and one by one roslis uhm were responsible for the five goals indonesia's consolation coming from randy lai both these teams obviously had to face the group favourite malaysia but on the surface of it it looks as though singapore have guaranteed themselves at least a silver with this five one win yes exactly bertrand and uh
