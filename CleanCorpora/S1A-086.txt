So and there only is one word 
In Pratibha Nagar also there are uh bissi

The bissi was fully programmed uhn
 so it was in our home
 Uhn

have to prepare some one word 
Uh
 One word food na 
Yeah 
And what is your idea about taking uh uh means English talking
classes ?
What is your idea about English talking classes is there no 
I don't no because I have no idea how they will teach and 
it is it is uh school onwards I didn't get
Ahn 
I don't have and I don't have experience 
Because so many will go uh
No but that is that is another thing
Because so many
One book is there no Rapidex
Rapidex English speaking course no it is also
nice uh but uh
 That is a 
The same thing if we can read the book in sometime 
we'll go to class
Uhn 
The same result only this conversation is not there 
So many will uh rush to the classes but I think 
classes is not uh proper because English speaking means it will come
by practice yeah yeah I think so
 Yeah yeah
