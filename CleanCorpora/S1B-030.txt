""
""
So  in the
new situation 
uh issues or problem
""
""
Quite right 
""
Rasgotraji  that
as a concept 
""
If you  with the
famous speech of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament
""
""
Nineteen forty-six
""
""
Nineteen forty-six 
""
But as a movement it is  thirty-one years old
""
""
Now  it has had criticism from all
quarters that you are mentioning 
""
There were critics even during the 
""
Would you say that in the present situation the concept is still
valid ?
""
That uh 
""
Number two has the non-align movement 
balance of say  do you think
the ledger uh 
""
Has it you got anything to be satisfied about  in terms of the
fact that it define for itself a certain agenda  ?
""
Has it fulfilled at least any element of post agenda or some
elements of those agenda  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
I think the foreign policy uh 
country having foreign policies  four thousand
years let us say for a long time 
""
Originally the concept that controlled or conditioned the  uh
framing of foreign policy and its  was the doctrine of
the supremacy of power 
""
Take up your neighbour 
""
So you are a dominant power
""
""
Might is right 
""
""
Then 
which had many more state impending on one another 
""
And this concept grew in the Italian city-states  of the
medieval age 
""
Uh the back concept is balance of power
""
But basically that was also very much rooted in the use of power
""
""
Now in nineteen forty-seven with the Independance of India a whole
new world emerged 
""
And in the fiftees and the sixtees  hundred new
countries joined the global panorama 
""
And this  of a new concept
 and the conduct of foreign policies in the
country
""
That is  the
evolution of the concept 
""
Now this I think is a very permanent sort of contribution  to
the whole idea what a foreign policy is ?
""
How it should be conducted ?
""
And so on and so forth 
""
Therefore this is something which is not going to become irrelevant
""
""
Those earlier concepts have not become irrelevent today 
""
The idea is to make them irrelevent 
""
What is non-aligned uh  they forget the
name 
""
 independance co-operation among
nations 
""
I think these three concepts are 
""
Now these are concepts which are not likely to become irrelevent
""
""
To come to the second point uhm about the  uh record or the
ledger of this movement 
""
Look at the initial agenda 
""
It was decolonization  the
disbandment 
""
All those  most of those items have been acomplished
""
And I think in their accomplishment in decolonization for example
 generating pressure for the
""
""
Non-alignment  non-aligned movement has played a very very
significant role 
""
Now times have changed 
""
Mind you times have changed in a very limited sense
""
I think  wrong to take that there are no alliances
""
Today NATO still exists 
""
""
""
What happened in the Gulf recently  uh
for us to bear in mind 
""
And 
""
While the last  to oppose the concept
of law 
""
It is not uh  uh to
become a camp follower  and
the other has disappeared 
""
And certainly for India  not the role I
visualised 
""
""
Well uh  is
there  because
governments which are subscribed to non-aligned  one
word 
""
And this perhaps explains one reason 
""
The reason why  those movement started with only twenty-five
members 
""
It is not as many as hundred and two or hundred and three members
and more and more  least want to come in either as guests
or as obeservers  or something
""
So Mani there must be something in the movement  to attract
them  A
""
And B  perhaps want to find out and assert
 what non-align movement is going to do ?
""
In which area is it is it going to operate ?
""
Because  anti-imperialsim
""
""
Theatre  exhausted into it
""
In what is a new theatre in which  non-align movement can
operate
""
""
""
""
""
Viswam scepticism  is largely spoiled by
ignorance 
""
And when you say  gentle word non-official
 time
understanding the main spirits  of not only Indian Foreign Policy but the
foreign policy of a hundred newly independent counrty 
""
Who would wonder whether  non-alignment merely is a simplistic
equation with not being involved 
into rival military camps 
""
When you ask what is the new role of non-alignment ?
""
I would prefer to take Mr  and think
what is the role of non-alignment in the new  international context rather
than  seek a new role for non-align movement
""
Because  the fundamental battle of non-align movement is
against the quest for dominance 
""
We shall  for almost
all of human history 
""
The only reason  for all the human
history is that ever since Jawaharlal Nehru  became a major player on the
international field  on international
relation 
""
The better values that has been evolved by Mahatma Gandhi  in
the freedom movement  there a new concept was thrown upon the chess board
of international politics 
""
That new chess board being  uh concept being
 a
quest for co-operation 
""
Is it possible for countries which are 
 in their economic political or military endowments
 where we strive
to attain a  optimum
""
A 
that no one is better off by being at a different point of the equiliberium
and everyone  is better off by being attract particular point
""
""
""
""
""
Well in other words  what
 inequality still
persist  in order to remove those inequality
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 one
or two words  if I may just for a second to
what I opened with 
""
So long as inequality persists  non-alignment is required
""
So long as oppression is there  non-alignment is required
""
And so long as equal respect  that the
sovereignity of every single nation  that long will non-alignment
""
""
""
""
""
 Professor Mishra
""
""
 one of the
main reasons for misunderstanding  in so far as the role and relevence of
non-alignment is concerned  uh so called
soft power 
""
Journals books universities research institutions and so on
""
And 
""
Newspapers television this that and so on 
""
This  uh elites
in many countries 
""
Some of these 
""
These are the people who have no  of our hopes
and aspirations 
""
Therefore 
including newspapers in India some of the national newspapers 
""
Papers 
which 
""
Now this is one thing about uh  I mean the the mass media and
the so called soft power 
""
The other thing which we must keep in mind is that when Jawaharlal
Nehru 
""
He had two things in mind 
""
One was that this country was economically poor 
""
Politically  of not much consequence except that the leadership
was trying to 
""
And at the same time the international situation was very  one
word 
""
In fact the the clouds of the third world war  uh on our
horizon 
""
He tried to float the idea of non-alignment in order  to
subserve  in an international atmosphere of
peace and harmony 
""
So in his view  one word
 national and international
 were not antagonistic with each other
""
But they were to function in harmony with each other
""
""
Quite right 
""
Mr Rasgotra you want want 
""
""
""
""
""
I just want to 
I find much more evident here in our own country than I found it for example
in Europe
""
I was there uh last month 
""
I travelled around 
""
Uh in countries like Germany and France  there is a strong
feeling 
""
As if  uh are
coming up
""
There are new divisions arising
""
Among the developed world also  uh scramble
for markets 
""
Uh economic pressures and other things
""
Now 
""
In Europe I found great sympathy  with objectives of this
movement its way of conducting itself 
""
And I think that should 
""
We should not think of non-alignment or non-align movement as a
thing between two other things  United States
of America 
""
But as some an entity in itself with a positive role with a
positive concept
""
Then this kind of  scepticism misunderstanding will not arise
""
""
""
Mr 
""
""
""
""
""
Here is in if you permit me I will just say one sentence
""
""
Yes
""
""
That 
""
On account of cereberal deficiency 
""
I say moral timidity because  by a
certain power  and we are all very
uh  is unnecessarily
amongst us
""
""
Quite right
""
""
Try to  stress that
""
""
Non-alignment is basically an alternative moral power
""
And  the perception that Mr Rasgotra have
visited Europe 
""
Of people in Europe thinking  all relevent
adjust the time when sceptics in our country are thinking  we're
""
""
Is that there is a type  between the
polarities of the global politics  and the polarities of the global
economy 
""
In the global economy there are only two  really resurgent
players 
""
There is Germany 
""
""
""
""
""
Neither of them has a role in the global polity 
""
And the global polity  which
is in the mist of the worst recession 
""
This is as experienced in
""
""
Domestically right
""
""
""
""
And therefore everyone is searching for a new role
""
And at that point in time  everyone is looking for a new role
""
""
Specially those who used to be the dominant power 
""
For us to say 
uh situation would be the biggest  mistake we could do
""
""
No I have we not heard about 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Viswam I want to refined uh 
permission his phrase a little
""
He said 
""
I think uh 
""
""
Moral force or no moral force
""
Obviously there is a force of some kind when hundred countries get
together 
""
""
I think  a an alternative vision of the world
""
""
Not a world of power 
co-operation 
""
So that 
""
But the vision  and one world can come
about only  but justice fair-play
equality peace  co-operation
""
""
If you permit me I would say this  to me to
be a little idealistic 
""
 E H
 the conduct of foreign
policy is not an exercise 
""
Therefore modern dimension is there but  to
 in the context of either non-alignment or
foreign policy I think uh
