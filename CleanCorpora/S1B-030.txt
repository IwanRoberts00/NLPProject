So the the the movement in the
new situation has to concentrate or adjust itself to many of this 
uh issues or problem
Quite right 
Rasgotraji one uh issue I would like to raise which is that
as a concept non-alignment is perhaps uh forty years old 
If you takes take its birth with the
famous speech of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament
Nineteen forty-six
Nineteen forty-six 
But as a movement it is uh thirty thirty-one years old
Now despite the fact that uh it has had criticism from all
quarters that you are mentioning 
There were critics even during the two words 
Would you say that in the present situation the concept is still
valid ?
That uh that is number one 
Number two has the non-align movement if it opens a 
balance of say performance or achievement and I think do you think
the ledger uh shows more credit or discredits 
Has it you got anything to be satisfied about in terms of the
fact that it define for itself a certain agenda ?
Has it fulfilled at least any element of post agenda or some
elements of those agenda ?
 Let's take the concept first 
Yes 
I think the foreign policy uh the whole idea of 
country having foreign policies have been evolving four thousand
years let us say for a long time 
Originally the concept that controlled or conditioned the uh
framing of foreign policy and its one word was the doctrine of
the supremacy of power 
Take up your neighbour and the next and the next 
So you are a dominant power
Might is right 
Then came a more uh rational concept in a world 
which had many more state impending on one another 
And this concept grew in the Italian city-states of the
medieval age 
Uh the back concept is balance of power
But basically that was also very much rooted in the use of power
Now in nineteen forty-seven with the Independance of India a whole
new world emerged 
And in the fiftees and the sixtees some hundred new
countries joined the global panorama 
And this called for the definition of a new concept
 of our foreign policy and the conduct of foreign policies in the
country
That is India's contribution uh to the the
evolution of the concept 
Now this I think is a very permanent sort of contribution to
the whole idea what a foreign policy is ?
How it should be conducted ?
And so on and so forth 
Therefore this is something which is not going to become irrelevant
 for a very very very long time 
Those earlier concepts have not become irrelevent today 
The idea is to make them irrelevent 
What is non-aligned uh concept basically they forget the
name 
 It's a policy of peace independance co-operation among
nations 
I think these three concepts are redundant 
Now these are concepts which are not likely to become irrelevent
To come to the second point uhm about the uh record or the
ledger of this movement 
Look at the initial agenda uh of the movement 
It was decolonization uh disarmament uh the
disbandment of apartheid racialism 
All those most of those items have been acomplished
And I think in their accomplishment in decolonization for example
 in dismantling of apartheid even in generating pressure for the
 beginning of disarmament nuclear disarmament 
Non-alignment non-aligned movement has played a very very
significant role which will be part of human history 
Now times have changed 
Mind you times have changed in a very limited sense
I think it's wrong to take that there are no alliances
Today NATO still exists 
 It's in search of a new role 
What happened in the Gulf recently is a good indicator uh
for us to bear in mind 
And it's the role of the non-align movement 
While the last Alliance Block persist to oppose the concept
of law 
It is not uh the role of newly independent country uh to
become a camp follower of one Block because one Block remains and
the other has disappeared 
And certainly for India that's not the role I
visualised 
Well uh whatever scepticism about the movement is
there it is mostly in non-official uh sources or quarters because
governments which are subscribed to non-aligned concept and one
word and movement are still committed to it 
And this perhaps explains one reason 
The reason why those movement started with only twenty-five
members in Belgrade 
It is not as many as hundred and two or hundred and three members
and more and more are at least want to come in either as guests
or as obeservers or something
So Mani there must be something in the movement to attract
them A
And B they would also perhaps want to find out and assert
 what non-align movement is going to do ?
In which area is it is it going to operate ?
Because the areas of uh imperialism anti-imperialsim
 anti-colonialism anti-racism all that 
Theatre is no more a rationing exhausted into it
In what is a new theatre in which non-align movement can
operate
 One or two words 
Viswam scepticism yes is largely spoiled by
ignorance and by destructiveness 
And when you say use that rather gentle word non-official
 we know that it's mostly people who have not spent time
understanding the main spirits of not only Indian Foreign Policy but the
foreign policy of a hundred newly independent counrty 
Who would wonder whether non-alignment merely is a simplistic
equation with not being involved in a world which is being divided up 
into rival military camps 
When you ask what is the new role of non-alignment ?
I would prefer to take Mr Rasgotra's phrase and think
what is the role of non-alignment in the new international context rather
than seek a new role for non-align movement
Because the fundamental battle of non-align movement is
against the quest for dominance 
We shall alienate international relation for almost
all of human history 
The only reason I'm not able to say for all the human
history is that ever since Jawaharlal Nehru became a major player on the
international field and brought to bear on international
relation 
The better values that has been evolved by Mahatma Gandhi in
the freedom movement there a new concept was thrown upon the chess board
of international politics 
That new chess board being that in the new uh concept being
 that instead of the quest for dominance could there be a
quest for co-operation 
Is it possible for countries which are uneq 
 unequal in their economic political or military endowments
 to have a relationship of equality between themselves where we strive
to attain a one word optimum
A one word optimum being one where neither 
that no one is better off by being at a different point of the equiliberium
and everyone is better off by being attract particular point
 Yes 
Well in other words I mean what what
 you're saying is inequality inequality still
persist and yeah in order to remove those inequality
 A few words 
 Yes 
 That's right that's what I one
or two words I want to revert if I may just for a second to
what I opened with 
So long as inequality persists non-alignment is required
So long as oppression is there non-alignment is required
And so long as equal respect is not accorded that the
sovereignity of every single nation that long will non-alignment
 One or two words 
 Yes Professor Mishra
 Right right I was saying that uh one of the
main reasons for misunderstanding in so far as the role and relevence of
non-alignment is concerned has occured because the uh so called
soft power is in the hands of the industrialized countries 
Journals books universities research institutions and so on
And connected with this is the instrument of mass media 
Newspapers television this that and so on 
This total situation has in a sense brainwashed uh elites
in many countries and it is reflected in some of our newspaper 
Some of these uh people are writing 
These are the people who have no appreciation of our hopes
and aspirations for our needs and requirements 
Therefore you we come across 
including newspapers in India some of the national newspapers 
Papers there they are writing articles on non-alignment 
which which are absolutely out of phase 
Now this is one thing about uh I mean the the mass media and
the so called soft power 
The other thing which we must keep in mind is that when Jawaharlal
Nehru pioneered this movement he was the real pioneer 
He had two things in mind 
One was that this country was economically poor 
Politically of not much consequence except that the leadership
was trying to fail on 
And at the same time the international situation was very one
word 
In fact the the clouds of the third world war uh on our
horizon on the international horizon at that time 
He tried to float the idea of non-alignment in order to
subserve national interest of India in an international atmosphere of
peace and harmony 
So in his view the total picture of of the one word
 was there in which the two systems national and international
 were not antagonistic with each other
But they were to function in harmony with each other
Quite right 
Mr Rasgotra you want want to say something 
 May I 
I just want to one word this kind of scepticism 
I find much more evident here in our own country than I found it for example
in Europe
I was there uh last month 
I travelled around 
Uh in countries like Germany and France there is a strong
feeling that this movement needs to be strengthened 
As if one word all kinds of new pressures uh are
coming up
There are new divisions arising
Among the developed world also there is uh new uh scramble
for markets 
Uh economic pressures and other things
Now this movement has a role in these circumstances 
In Europe I found great sympathy with objectives of this
movement its way of conducting itself 
And I think that should we we need to uh rethink 
We should not think of non-alignment or non-align movement as a
thing between two other things Russia Soviet Union United States
of America Communism or Democracy 
But as some an entity in itself with a positive role with a
positive concept
Then this kind of scepticism misunderstanding will not arise
Mr Rasgotra 
 One or two words 
Here is in if you permit me I will just say one sentence
Yes
That it's a very one word 
On account of cereberal deficiency and moral timidity 
I say moral timidity because we are poor or by the by a
certain power which has reversed most predominant and we are all very
uh this mantra of uni polarism is unnecessarily
amongst us
Quite right
Try to stress that
Non-alignment is basically an alternative moral power
And the reason why the perception that Mr Rasgotra have
visited Europe 
Of people in Europe thinking we're all relevent
adjust the time when sceptics in our country are thinking that we're
 perhaps less relevent 
Is that there is a type one word between the
polarities of the global politics and the polarities of the global
economy 
In the global economy there are only two really resurgent
players 
There is Germany and Japan 
 Japan 
Neither of them has a role in the global polity 
And the global polity is now dominated by one power which
is in the mist of the worst recession 
This is as experienced in
Domestically right
 A few words 
And therefore everyone is searching for a new role
And at that point in time everyone is looking for a new role
Specially those who used to be the dominant power 
For us to say that there is now no role for us in the new 
uh situation would be the biggest mistake we could do
No I have we not heard about India's role 
 a few words 
 A few words 
Viswam I want to refined uh with Mani's 
permission his phrase a little
He said alternative moral force 
I think uh 
Moral force or no moral force
Obviously there is a force of some kind when hundred countries get
together 
I think it's a an alternative vision of the world
Not a world of power but a world of justice peace 
co-operation equality among nations 
So that everybody goes together 
But the vision vision of one world and one world can come
about only not on the basis of power but justice fair-play
equality peace co-operation
If you permit me I would say this one word to me to
be a little idealistic 
 I I I remember a sentence which E H
 Kirk said in his famous book the conduct of foreign
policy is not an exercise in sainthood in morality 
Therefore modern dimension is there but to to to
 emphasis it too much in the context of either non-alignment or
foreign policy I think uh will not cut much ice
