<I>
""
""
So  in the
""
""
""
""
Quite right 
""
""
as a concept 
""
If you  with the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
quarters that you are mentioning 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the ledger uh 
""
""
fact that it define for itself a certain agenda  ?
""
""
elements of those agenda  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think the foreign policy uh 
""
years let us say for a long time 
""
Originally the concept that controlled or conditioned the  uh
framing of foreign policy and its  was the doctrine of
""
""
Take up your neighbour 
""
So you are a dominant power
""
""
Might is right 
""
""
Then 
which had many more state impending on one another 
""
And this concept grew in the Italian city-states  of the
medieval age 
""
Uh the back concept is balance of power
""
But basically that was also very much rooted in the use of power
""
""
""
""
""
""
countries joined the global panorama 
""
""
 and the conduct of foreign policies in the
""
""
That is  the
evolution of the concept 
""
Now this I think is a very permanent sort of contribution  to
""
""
How it should be conducted ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
name 
""
""
nations 
""
I think these three concepts are 
""
Now these are concepts which are not likely to become irrelevent
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I think in their accomplishment in decolonization for example
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
for us to bear in mind 
""
""
""
""
of law 
""
It is not uh  uh to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
there  because
""
word 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
or as obeservers  or something
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
operate
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And when you say  gentle word non-official
""
""
foreign policy of a hundred newly independent counrty 
""
""
equation with not being involved 
""
""
""
""
""
what is the role of non-alignment in the new  international context rather
than  seek a new role for non-align movement
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
history is that ever since Jawaharlal Nehru  became a major player on the
""
""
""
""
the freedom movement  there a new concept was thrown upon the chess board
""
""
That new chess board being  uh concept being
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and everyone  is better off by being attract particular point
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 one
""
what I opened with 
""
So long as inequality persists  non-alignment is required
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 one of the
""
non-alignment is concerned  uh so called
soft power 
""
Journals books universities research institutions and so on
""
And 
""
""
""
""
in many countries 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
including newspapers in India some of the national newspapers 
""
Papers 
which 
""
Now this is one thing about uh  I mean the the mass media and
""
""
The other thing which we must keep in mind is that when Jawaharlal
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
word 
""
In fact the the clouds of the third world war  uh on our
""
""
He tried to float the idea of non-alignment in order  to
subserve  in an international atmosphere of
""
""
So in his view  one word
""
""
""
But they were to function in harmony with each other
""
""
Quite right 
""
Mr Rasgotra you want want 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh in countries like Germany and France  there is a strong
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
for markets 
""
Uh economic pressures and other things
""
Now 
""
""
movement its way of conducting itself 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
positive concept
""
Then this kind of  scepticism misunderstanding will not arise
""
""
""
Mr 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
I say moral timidity because  by a
certain power  and we are all very
""
amongst us
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
visited Europe 
""
Of people in Europe thinking  all relevent
""
""
""
Is that there is a type  between the
""
economy 
""
""
players 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Neither of them has a role in the global polity 
""
And the global polity  which
""
""
""
""
""
Domestically right
""
""
""
""
""
""
And at that point in time  everyone is looking for a new role
""
""
Specially those who used to be the dominant power 
""
""
uh situation would be the biggest  mistake we could do
""
""
No I have we not heard about 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Moral force or no moral force
""
Obviously there is a force of some kind when hundred countries get
together 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
about only  but justice fair-play
""
""
""
If you permit me I would say this  to me to
