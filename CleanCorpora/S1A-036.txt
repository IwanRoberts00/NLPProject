<I>
So uhm I am Mr Shinde 
I am Mrs Heema Patil
Patil
Uhm 
So we uhm in fact we are concerned about so many
things now a days that we have to be talk about environment and
 uh the onset of western civilisation uh western gadgets 
What do you think about uh what will happen in this India 
 what do what do you feel about that 
About environment
Yes 
Uh sir the position of today environment is not so
good
Uhm
So I feel that the future is very dark according to me
It is dark 
So you think that uh unless people become aware 
 haan of the future problem uhn
 it will be very dark
 Haan 
 Uhn 
 Haan 
So what has made you think uh like this 
Uhn sir whenever I see uhn some paper and other
information
Uhm 
Then I feel that uh the air pollution is going on
increasing
Uhm 
Uhm it's due to our bomb blast uhn
 blast uhn and other things uhn these
are going uh to add uhn the crisis 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
Yeah 
 That's I feel that the future is dark
It is
There is noise pollution because of these uh refregerator
heating uhm like industrial development uhm
 perhaps even the management of natural resources
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Uh these are uhn making adverse effect on the
environment
On the environment
So I feel that the future is very dark
Future is very dark 
So I think you mean uh to put in very few words you
mean that you are we are depriving our children from yes 
pure nature uhm
 Yes 
Yes uh we are not uh
 So in fact 
We are criminals
Ah handing over uh 
We are not handing over as it has come to us
 No the 
Uhn as it has come to us 
 As it has come to us 
So you you think of the past 
Yes 
And your childhood
Uhn 
Uhn
Comparing with the childhood uh uh we were enjoying
the fresh and pure air
Uh uhn 
But uh at present uh the children are deprived of those
happy days
Uhn uhn
Those fresh and pure air and many other things
Uhn 
Because of this changing culture uhm because
of this noise pollution
 Uhm 
Yes 
Uh they are deprived of the pleasures which are
derived from the nature
Yes 
So it has to do with culture also
Culture also 
So uhm what do you say about uh this strange thing
that our religion our culture our past if we go to our past
We have gods and goddesses haan 
whom we worshipped haan you know 
They are uh they represent nature
 Haan 
 Haan 
Nature
Uhn then why this uh why people worship on the
one on the one hand but they behave very 
in a contradictory manner then take 
 According to me sir they have not the exact
idea of religion
Uhn 
Uh if I suppose that religion is uh just like uh 
Buddhism Jainism uhm Hinduism uhm but
actually the religion according to me it is based on uh it should
be based on science
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhn 
Uhm according to me religion means uh the property 
 uhm of the thing uhm which it
possesses it
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Yes 
For example this wood possesses the molecules uh 
That it will burn
Uhn it will burn
It is soft it can be uhn it can moulded
 yes
 It is bended uhn it is soft 
Moulded 
It is the religion of this uh wood
Yeah this wood uhn 
If there is a metal then it is malleable it is ductile
So what is the religion of man now then 
 This is the property of 
Then 
At present
Uhn the religion of soul is uh the knowledge 
 uhn highest knowledge uhn and inspiration
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
Uhn 
And uh means soul possesses this qualities
Yes 
The body if the body is separated from it 
uhm then body possess the uh colour uhm then 
fame uhm uh what are these in Marathi as you say the
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Gandha 
 Rakta Gandha Varha these
are the rakta uh dharma 
or the qualities of this soul 
 That's why people must know uhm that uh
 what is the real religion of the man
 Uh 
 Rakta 
 Uh uh uh 
 Uhm 
Uhn
And they should not collect this shouldn't run after this 
uh material progress
Uh hoarding haan they should
not hoard
 Haan 
 Haan hoard
Uhn uh that is the basic cause of even
adding into pollution
 This is uhn 
Pollution
 Haan 
If they do not start uh possessing all these things then
hoarding all this things uhn uh perhaps they will 
understand the real nature of this religion 
And they will try to gain that pure uh enjoyment 
uh ha from the religion
 Uhn uh 
 Uh ha 
 Uhn uh 
That is true uh that is true 
If we can feel you see so that means if more and more
people uhn understand understand the real
nature of religion based on science science and not on
superstitious superstitious uhn and that does not also
mean that they should carried away by some crazy western ideas
 Uh 
 Uhn 
 Understand 
 Science 
 Superstitious 
Yes 
They should go to our past
Our past 
And uh to think on these things and try to change
Change 
So what
A real sir uh according to me uh this religion uh
 do not tell us uhm does not tell us uhm
 that uh we should uh kill anybody
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm so ahimsa is the most
important principle
 Uh 
Means uh of uh in case of this plant if we hurt
it uhm means if we destroy it uhm 
then the important uh uh element of the nature is destroyed
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Destroyed
And the this uh what are they called advantage of
uh that plant as uh are also destroyed
 Are 
They are extinct uh like animals are 
extinct plants are also getting yeah that is true
 That's the haan 
 You should not hurt it 
All this life uh like that 
 The other day we were we were discussing
about haan somebody told us that 
 haan the hybridisation of rice is not possible now
 Haan 
 Haan 
Yeah
Some thirty thousand uh species were there and now there
are only
Only 
Eight hundred
Uhn eight hundred 
About eight hundred natural species 
 Ah ha ha 
That means we are really depriving our own future
 Every individual has uh important role 
 yes to play in this environment
 Yes 
And we are killing that
Ahn we are killing that 
That is uh that is the reality 
 Not knowing the real reason 
Yes that way also
Yes sir means uh we should remain uh free from all
passion
Uhn 
Means hatred killing uhm e 
extreme jealous yeah all these things
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
Going going to the extreme of any passion
Any passion 
We should try to uhn uh have equiliberium
 Uhn 
Equiliberium 
And only to have as much as is uhn necessary
 essential
 Uhn 
Essential
Essential that
If we try to reduce our uh needs uhm then
 we'll have to get this supreme satisfaction joy
 Uhm 
 Joy 
Joy so 
If people understand this religion then there will be no
pollution there will be no noise pollution or sound pollution
Uhm 
Uh because of this uh more and more needs
Uhm uhm 
And people are becoming becoming more and more greedy
Yes 
They are facing all these material pleasure and uh 
that's that's why they these are the factories 
coming up and that's why these prices are also zooming up
 Yes yes 
Yes 
So if we try to understand our needs uh reduce our
 cough minimise our needs
Uhm 
Then we will not uh produce all these things
Yes that is true
So then there will be no problem of pollution and all
these 
Yes
People will happily
Yes 
So this type of an education should be given then 
from the primary stage 
 Should be given right from the primary stage
Yeah primary stage ah
So I think Maharashtra government has uhm 
they have started this uh this subject 
 Uhm 
 Ahn they have added one topic uh
One topic
Uh 
On envi 
In pollution in science book I saw
Ah ha ha 
In science book
So they had they are taking it seriously now
Ah seriously
Atleast on the subjects 
In uh
You see that they are 
Uh mean they they are when they uh came to know
 uhm about it's uh adverse effect
 Uhm 
Yes 
So 
Impending danger 
Uhn impending
Now they are uh
 That's why
Now they are becoming aware of that 
But it is all in the hands of uh our representatives 
who do not know much about
 Ahn 
Much about
The the dangers if the teachers and 
intellectuals if they organise
Ahn 
And uh go to the society uhn like that
trying to impart
 Uhn 
Yes ahn 
They went to the masses 
Uhm 
Do you think that the intellectuals go to the masses at
present 
Uhm I do not think so 
No they are worried about their own 
 Think so ah they ahn uhn 
Own quest or own uh they are running after
their job
 Running for 
Identity 
Ah they don't have their own identity
 Id ahn 
But on the other hand I think it is
They have the wrong notion of their intellect 
 haan I feel
 Haan 
Yes so they are not real intellectual you mean
Intellectual intellectuals do not feel any proud of their
knowledge
Yes 
Because knowledge is so vast yes that uh uh
 Yes 
You cannot grasp
We possess only ahn 
We we only possess the tip of the iceberg
Tip ahn yes
Like that
Like that 
So don't you think it is very uh significant thing to
 uh notice uhn that if we when we think of
religion ahn or the ideas about religion that you talked
about ahn which takes us back to uh looking at our own
body ahn and nature and balance in that 
ahn and then we can have a peaceful and uh pleasurable life
 Uhn 
 Ahn 
 Ahn 
 Ahn 
 Ahn 
Ahn
Uhm so these are the ideas which have come from
Indian side
Uhn
Religions from this side 
But uh at present what we see is people who geographically are
here ahn are not aware of these ideas
 Ahn 
No
But those who live in other countries ahn 
like western countries
 Ahn 
Ahn
Uh who are very affluent countries
Affluent
But they are borrowing ideas from Indian religions and
Yes I have heard that uh some people they are also
 uhn accepting this uh non violence
Uhm
They are building up these uhm uh temples
there
 Uhm 
Yes yes 
And some of them have started following this path also
Uhm uhm
So in that case they are means uh 
They are 
Ah uhn
Now in fact they are following it
Following it 
And very sincerly 
I have read in the paper
Uhm uhm so that is the happy thing
Many peo many people have come to some times
and they were asking about uh this religion uhn and what
is the philosophy of this uh Indian culture and all this
 Uhn 
Uhn I know they do ask about these things 
That time we uh felt ashamed of our people
Uhm 
And I remember here once we met uh Miss
Martin
 So many here uh 
Uhm
From England and Sheril Hiper from America
Uhm 
Came to this uh Backsinger memorial library
Uhm uhm 
And like means uh means at that time I used to go 
for conversational classes

 I met 
No

Before you join your M A
