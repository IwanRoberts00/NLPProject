<I>
""
""
So 
""
""
I am Mrs  Heema Patil
""
""
Patil
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So we  so many
things now a days  talk about environment and
""
""
What do you think about 
""
""
""
About environment
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uh sir  environment is not so
good
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So I feel that the future is very dark according to me
""
""
It is dark 
""
So you think that 
 uhn
 it will be very dark
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So what has made you 
""
""
Uhn sir  other
information
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Then I feel that  uh the air pollution is going on
increasing
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uhm  uhn
 these
are going 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 I feel that the future is dark
""
""
It is
""
""
There is noise pollution because of these  uh refregerator
heating  uhm
 perhaps even the management of natural resources
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uh  uhn making adverse effect on the
environment
""
""
On the environment
""
""
So I feel that the future is very dark
""
""
Future is very dark 
""
So I think  you
mean that you are 
pure nature  uhm
""
""
""
""
""
Yes uh  not uh
""
""
""
""
""
We are criminals
""
""
Ah 
""
""
We are not handing over as  come to us
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
""
""
So 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And your childhood
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Comparing with the childhood  we were enjoying
the fresh and pure air
""
""
Uh uhn 
""
""
But uh at present  uh the children are deprived of those
happy days
""
""
Uhn uhn
""
""
Those fresh and pure air and  many other things
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Because of this changing culture  because
of this noise pollution
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uh they are deprived of the  which are
derived from the nature
""
""
Yes 
""
So it has to do with culture also
""
""
Culture also 
""
""
So  uh this strange thing
that  past if we go to our past
""
We have gods and goddesses 
whom we worshipped 
""
They are uh  nature
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Nature
""
""
Uhn  on the
one 
in a contradictory manner 
""
""
 sir they have not the exact
idea of religion
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Uh 
Buddhism Jainism  but
actually the religion  uh it should
be based on science
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Uhm according to me religion means 
 which it
possesses it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
For example 
""
""
That it will burn
""
""
Uhn  it will burn
""
""
It is soft  moulded
 yes
""
""
""
""
""
Moulded 
""
It is the religion of this uh  wood
""
""
Yeah this wood uhn 
""
""
If there is a metal  then it is malleable it is ductile
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
Then 
""
""
At present
""
""
Uhn 
 inspiration
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
And uh means soul possesses this qualities
""
""
Yes 
""
""
The body 
uhm 
fame  what are these in Marathi as you say the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 these
are the 
or the 
""
 that uh
 real religion of the man
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn
""
""
And they should not collect this shouldn't run after this 
uh material progress
""
""
Uh hoarding  they should
not hoard
""
""
""
""
""
 hoard
""
""
Uhn uh  even
adding into pollution
""
""
""
""
""
Pollution
""
""
""
""
""
If they do not start uh  possessing all these things then
hoarding all this things 
understand the real nature of this 
""
And they will try to gain that pure 
uh ha  from the religion
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is true 
""
If we can feel  if more and more
people  the real
nature of religion  and not on
superstitious  and that does not also
mean that they should carried away by  some crazy western ideas
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
They should go to our past
""
""
Our past 
""
""
And  try to change
""
""
Change 
""
""
So what
""
""
A real  this religion uh
 uhm
 we should uh kill anybody
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  most
important principle
""
""
""
""
""
Means  if we hurt
it 
then  uh uh element of the nature is destroyed
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Destroyed
""
""
And the  advantage of
uh that plant  also destroyed
""
""
""
""
""
They are extinct 
extinct  yeah that is true
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All this life 
""
""
 we were discussing
about 
 the hybridisation of rice is not possible now
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Some thirty thousand  uh species were there and now there
are only
""
""
Only 
""
""
Eight hundred
""
""
Uhn eight hundred 
""
""
About eight hundred 
""
""
""
""
""
That means we are really depriving our own  future
""
""
""
""
 to play in this environment
""
""
""
""
""
And we are killing that
""
""
Ahn we are killing that 
""
""
That is uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  that way also
""
""
Yes sir  uh free from all
passion
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Means 
extreme jealous  all these things
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Going going to the extreme of any passion
""
""
Any passion 
""
""
We should try to  uh have equiliberium
""
""
""
""
""
Equiliberium 
""
""
And only to have as much as is  necessary
 essential
""
""
""
""
""
Essential
""
""
Essential  that
""
""
If we try to reduce our uh  then
 joy
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Joy 
""
""
If people understand this religion  then there will be no
pollution  there will be no noise pollution or sound pollution
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uh because of this uh  more and more needs
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And people are becoming  becoming more and more greedy
""
""
Yes 
""
""
They are facing all these material pleasure and 
that's 
coming up  why these prices are also zooming up
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So if we try to  uh reduce our
 minimise our needs
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Then we will not uh  produce all these things
""
""
Yes  that is true
""
""
So  then there will be no problem of pollution and all
these 
""
""
Yes
""
""
People will happily
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So this type of an education should be given then 
from the primary stage 
""
""
 primary stage
""
""
Yeah primary stage ah
""
""
So I think Maharashtra government has 
they have started this 
""
""
""
""
""
 one topic uh
""
""
One topic
""
""
Uh 
""
""
On 
""
""
In pollution  in science book I saw
""
""
Ah ha ha 
""
""
In science book
""
""
So they had  they are taking it seriously now
""
""
Ah seriously
""
""
Atleast on the subjects 
""
""
In  uh
""
""
You see that they are 
""
""
Uh mean they  came to know
 adverse effect
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So 
""
""
Impending danger 
""
""
Uhn impending
""
""
Now they are uh
""
""
 why
""
""
Now they are becoming aware of that 
""
But it is all in the hands of uh 
who  do not know much about
""
""
""
""
""
Much about
""
""
The 
intellectuals if they organise
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
And uh  like that
trying to impart
""
""
""
""
""
Yes ahn 
""
""
They went to the masses 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Do you think that the intellectuals go to the masses  at
present 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
""
Own quest  after
their  job
""
""
""
""
""
Identity 
""
""
Ah they don't have their own identity
""
""
""
""
""
But on the other hand I think it is
""
""
They have the wrong notion of their intellect 
 I feel
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  you mean
""
""
Intellectual  intellectuals do not feel any proud of their
knowledge
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Because knowledge is so vast  that uh uh
""
""
""
""
""
You cannot grasp
""
""
We possess only ahn 
""
""
We we only possess  the tip of the iceberg
""
""
Tip ahn yes
""
""
Like that
""
""
Like that 
""
""
So don't you think it is very  uh significant thing to
 when we think of
religion  or the ideas about religion that you talked
about  uh looking at our own
body 
ahn  uh pleasurable life
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn
""
""
Uhm  have come from
Indian side
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Religions 
""
But uh at present what we see is  people who geographically are
here  are not aware of these ideas
""
""
""
""
""
No
""
""
But those who live in other countries 
like western countries
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn
""
""
Uh  who are very affluent countries
""
""
Affluent
""
""
But they are borrowing ideas from Indian religions and
""
""
Yes I have heard that  they are also
 this uh non violence
""
""
Uhm
""
""
They are building up these  uh temples
there
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes 
""
""
And some of them have  started following this path also
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
So 
""
""
They are 
""
""
Ah uhn
""
""
Now  they are following it
""
""
Following it 
""
""
And very sincerly 
""
""
I have read in the paper
""
""
Uhm uhm  so that is the happy thing
""
""
Many  some times
and they were asking about  and what
is the philosophy of this  uh Indian culture and all this
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn I know 
""
""
That time we  uh felt ashamed of our people
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And I remember  Miss
Martin
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
From England  and Sheril Hiper from America
""
""

""
