Hello Chandrakala 
""
""
Fine 
""
And how are you
""
You seem to be quite lethargic 
""
""
Oh it is because  invited me
for this 
""
Uh I had a  and perhaps it has its
effect 
""
""
And 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And I think uh 
if they invite any guests or  these are few
things that they 
""
 jilabi
 that
""
""
Oh  sometimes
no they will 
""
""
Yeah 
""
No don't you think that  uh uh about this food and food habits
and all 
""
""
Now but we are saying  puran poli
 why you are feeling that is very heavy and
lethargic 
""
But these food habits they differ from country to country
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Generation to generation  family even
the individual 
""
""
 on
 likings and dislikings
""
That is also there  and it may be due to climate also
""
""
Yeah and you are not used to all this food
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Maybe 
""
And 
""
""
Here  most of
the people they will have 
for their food 
""
And uh 
as a  plain food
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  true
""
""
""
""
""
In north 
they prefer wheat 
""
Then  belong to
east for example  they like to have
 rice
""
""
Yes 
""
""
 the staple diet there
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But now don't you feel that uh  previously it so happened
 prefer
rice 
""
Those who belong to north and west all  mostly they prefer wheat
""
""
But now people are coming from all walks of life from all states of
life  their business
""
""
And now  all are familiar with all types of food
""
""
Yeah they are 
""
And gradually they will be accustomed to that kind of food 
""
When one will begin to live in that particular 
""
""
""
""
""
""
But one difference what I find is  that in this generation
maybe it is the influence of 
""
This young generation the young persons  they are so used to
this 
they  so they go for junk food
""
""
""
""
""
Oh  readymade
""
""
The fast food
""
""
""
""
""
The canned food 
""
""
Yes it is there but uh  directly they will be affected by
""
""
 there
""
""
The other one
""
""
As  isn't it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm but uh
""
""
And what we feel  food that is
the best
""
""
Ah see here no in uh 
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And uh  has given the
opinions about uh  above eighty years old
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh really if we read it no  uh I feel that vegetarian
food and uh 
satvik  that will be very good to health
""
""
""
""
""
And  in the
 opinion of many persons like that
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  we should say that
 no even we
go for that 
""
Then as a matter of fact  that sprouted
 and fresh food is a must for good
health 
""
What I feel is  do affect our mind
 thought
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Actions 
""
""
Uh
""
""
Our physique 
""
Because just see 
who eat very  hot or spicy food
""
""
Uhn they will be short tempered 
""
""
Uhn they depend  yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
And what I feel the food that we eat  that affects our
physique also 
""
Because uh  this all this
fried things and all  put on weight
""
""
""
""
""
Another thing the cholestrol level also 
""
So there is possibility of 
""
Then those who have blood pressures and gasterol
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Eat less of uh  those who are
diabetes 
""
So all these people they are so habituated  very
difficult 
""
""
But what I feel no  uh we people will begin to think up
all these effects only when uh 
some disease and all  but uh
""
""
""
""
""
But prevention is better than cure
""
""
Yeah that is there but uh  they
will eat what they like  even it is not good for health
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
They will not care about the
""
""
Least bothered about
""
""
But 
taking some 
""
""
Actually
""
""
As a matter of fact the best thing is  to have a balanced
diet 
""
""
And what I feel is again about food habit like this 
talking food food habits enough
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
What you feel 
""
But still there is a difference  food of diferent
states 
""
For example if you go to Calcutta 
""
Now in Calcutta what you find  the accent the intonation the
articulation the food  something quite
differnt from south 
""
There what you find is  they'll
""
""
Instead of saying  ba
""
""
For example for Shivani they will Shibani 
""
Ravindranath 
""
About the eating habit also  they prefer the cheese
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Cheese 
""
Then 
as I  we
don't have fresh vegetables and 
""
So mostly we used to have that  daal
batti  ghee bhat
""
""
""
Which food 
""
""
 I presume you are coming
from Karnatak
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Let us know something 
""
""
Uh you know  usually people will
prefer  roti
""
chapati 
""
Then rice  curry
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And they prefer more  ghee
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
In hot rice they like it 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
In uh  idli dosa
 then rice
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Perhaps 
but we people here no  two
words 
""
""
""
""
""
I must confess though I don't belong to south but still I too
am fond of 
""
I must say  uh it is easy easy to digest
these things 
""
Then what we have in  and eat something else for
food 
""
""
But I feel 
prepared out of  it is better than
""
""
It will be  it will be affecting our health
""
""
I feel  one word
""
""
Whatever we eat  we
should try to develop such habits
""
""
Uh for example what they are 
""
""
The fresh 
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Ones a balanced diet  one
word 
""
""
It should be nutrious
""
""
Whatever it is 
""
""
But don't you think that  our own
people no  or spices
""
""
Uhn
""
""
But uh even for using spices there must be some reason
""
""
It it had  two
words  it did add to the taste and colour
of the food 
""
But it had medicinal medicinal powers also 
""
For example turmeric
""
""
Uhm
""
""
A very good anticeptic  that also helps
to have stomach 
""
""
Then garlic 
""
""
 these things too
""
""
""
But the colours that we uh  preparations
no  it is very injurious to health
""
But inspite of all that we use it 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And I think  it depends
on the 
""
The state also where it all these things grow 
""
Wherever paddy grows obviously people will have  yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then about the timings also I would like to 
about these habits  they have a
different schedule 
""
""
""
""
""
Obviously 
""
""
So  one word
""
""
In the morning also you should try to eat earlier  in the night
also if you eat  that should be quite
light
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Not very 
""
Now many people they are used to accustomed to eat  very heavy
food at night 
""
That also affects the digestion 
""
""
everyday in the morning  very important
""
""
Yes sound health is essential to have sound mind no
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Then  firstly
""
""
""
By the way  the
college timing 
""
In the morning 
uhn 
""
And what we have is 
wheat 
""
As a matter of fact  it's
""
""
Then  that depends on
the classes 
""
When I return 
""
Now lunch comprises of  a
personal 
""
We have 
little bit of  a few
words 
""
""
""
""
""
Oh god 
""
""
Pickles sometimes 
though 
""
Uhm then again in the evening  one
word 
""
Then  uh dinner same as
lunch 
""
And another thing that people avoid is 
it's  laughter
""
""
But what we do many times  if
we tell our children 
which spoils their teeth also 
fruit should be  uh
food instead of  that is what I feel
""
Everyone 
cutted  best thing is to take apple
 as it is without cutting it
""
That is what  in different place
""
""
But instead of that  instead of milk
they would like to have ice-cream 
""
But you see they don't feel  effects after effects
or adverse effects they 
""
So what do you think what are the fruits that are grown  two
words 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We have banana  and I I like it very much
""
Daily I use the 
""
""
""
""
""
Another thing what I found  there are few
things which are common 
""
And  dal
""
""
Vegetable salad everybody uses 
""
Then in some form or the other 
curd 
""
So I think that also helps in digestion 
""
""
""
What do you think 
""
""
Yes that is true 
""
I too use milk 
more than milk
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I mean the curd 
but it should not be used too much but inspite of that uh  one's
""
""
And as far as myself I will have cup of tea in the morning
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Then at nine thirty I will have some light tiffin at  one
""
""
And usually I prefer green vegetables  then
buttermilk 
""
Then 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn  in the in the evening that is at uh in the evening
so after eight thirty or nine 
""
Everyday I will have 
""
laughs 
""
""
What I what I think is  that these food habits should be
developed from the time when the children are very young
""
Then  all the people in the house should be
""
""
Instead of getting them biscuits  or juice
""
vegetable 
""
So if we develop that taste from the very beginning  obviously
 they will continue through out their life
""
And  health physical health
""
""
But 
even children are found of  and all
these things 
""
And inspite of that  as soon as it gets up from
the bed no  demands for tea only
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And  first we
must have a tea
""
So I really feel 
""
""
Ahn 
""
And in the morning also one thing is that  uh
""
""
But before that without brushing and all then they go  laughter
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
As I told 
""
So  and before
going to sleep  one should brush the teeth atleast
""
""
Yeah
