<I>
Hello Chandrakala how are you 
Fine 
And how are you
You seem to be quite lethargic 
Oh it is because uh one of our friends here invited me
for this uh lunch you know 
Uh I had a puran poli and perhaps it has its
effect laughs 
And that's why 
Yeah 
And I think uh that's a favourite dish or 
if they invite any guests or anyone the these are few
things that they serve 
 It's puran poli or jilabi
 or gulab jamun that
Oh for eating they are a very tasty but uh sometimes
no they will affects affert our health 
Yeah that's true 
No don't you think that uh uh about this food and food habits
and all that's these differs differ 
 
Now but we are saying you are not used to puran poli
 maybe that's why you are feeling that is very heavy and
lethargic 
But these food habits they differ from country to country
Yeah
Generation to generation state to state family even
the individual each individual 
 It depends it depends of on
 one's likings and dislikings
That is also there and it may be due to climate also
Yeah and you are not used to all this food
Yeah
Maybe that's why you are feeling lethargic 
And what else do you think about the food habits over here 
Here usually what happens no in your area most of
the people they will have that jowar uhm 
for their food 
And uh in Bangalore or Mysore they will have rice 
as a plain food
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
Yeah that's true
 Haan 
In north and west all these northerners westerners 
they prefer wheat 
Then from the north or people who will belong to
east for example Calcutta and all they prefer they like to have
 rice
Yes 
 That's the staple diet there
Uhm 
But now don't you feel that uh previously it so happened
 that those who belong to east or south east they used to prefer
rice 
Those who belong to north and west all mostly they prefer wheat
But now people are coming from all walks of life from all states of
life due to studies maybe or you can say for their business
 or service 
And now all are familiar with all types of food
Yeah they are 
And gradually they will be accustomed to that kind of food 
When one will begin to live in that particular area 
 automatically they will be accustomed to that 
 Yeah 
But one difference what I find is that in this generation
maybe it is the influence of the T V as the mass media 
This young generation the young persons they are so used to
this or may be they don't have so much time at their disposal now 
they want readymade food so they go for junk food
 Haan 
Oh readymade
The fast food
 Haan 
The canned food all that don't you think so 
Yes it is there but uh directly they will be affected by
 Haan that's there
The other one
As we Indians feel that they are three types isn't it
 Haan 
 Satvik rajsik and tamsik 
Uhm but uh
And what we feel that satvik food that is
the best
Ah see here no in uh Karmungra there is one word 
Yeah 
And uh that uh the one word has given the
opinions about uh the persons uh above eighty years old
Uhm uhm 
And uh really if we read it no uh I feel that vegetarian
food and uh that satvik what you called 
satvik food no that will be very good to health
 That's 
And this is the secret of their health uh in the
 opinion of many persons like that
 Ah ha 
Yeah actually as a matter of fact we should say that
 some people eat to live some live to eat laughs no even we
go for that 
Then as a matter of fact uh what I feel is that sprouted
 or fibrous nutrious salad and fresh food is a must for good
health 
What I feel is that food and food habit do affect our mind
 thought
Yeah 
Actions 
Uh
Our physique everything 
Because just see when we eat uh this person have said 
who eat very hot or spicy food
Uhn they will be short tempered very one word 
Uhn they depend one word in sense yeah
 There is an assumption 
And what I feel the food that we eat that affects our
physique also 
Because uh one can get if you eat very hot this all this
fried things and all one is you put on weight
 Haan 
Another thing the cholestrol level also goes up 
So there is possibility of heart attack one word 
Then those who have blood pressures and gasterol
Uhm 
Eat less of uh sugar uh sorry salt those who are
diabetes they are told to eat less sugar 
So all these people they are so habituated it's very
difficult but uh 
But what I feel no uh we people will begin to think up
all these effects only when uh we will be suffering from 
some disease and all but uh
 Suffering yeah 
But prevention is better than cure
Yeah that is there but uh most of the people no they
will eat what they like even it is not good for health
Uhm uhm
They will not care about the
Least bothered about
But when doctor suggested something then will go on 
taking some precaution precautions 
Actually
As a matter of fact the best thing is to have a balanced
diet laughs 
And what I feel is again about food habit like this 
talking food food habits enough
Yeah laughs still though 
What you feel I'm used to all types of food 
But still there is a difference one word food of diferent
states 
For example if you go to Calcutta 
Now in Calcutta what you find the accent the intonation the
articulation the food the food habits it's something quite
differnt from south 
There what you find is instead of saying Amar they'll
 say Amor 
Instead of saying wa they say ba
For example for Shivani they will Shibani 
Ravindranath they will say Rabindranath like that 
About the eating habit also they prefer the cheese
Uhn
Cheese fish all that flavour 
Then for Rajasthan again I would like to tell that 
as I belong to Bikaner I would like to say that there we
don't have fresh vegetables and one word 
So mostly we used to have that samari churmur daal
batti gatta papad all these things ghee bhat
 a few words 
Which food 
 One word I think I presume you are coming
from Karnatak
Yeah 
Let us know something 
Uh you know in Karnataka no usually people will
prefer that roti what we'll call roti
 it's prepared of jowar and 
chapati rarely once in a week they will do it 
Then rice curry
Uhm uhm
And they prefer more buttermilk milk ghee
 not so much butter but they like ghee 
Uhm
In hot rice they like it 
Uh 
In uh Mysore no they will prefer idli dosa
 then rice
Uhm 
Perhaps they can live months together without bread 
but we people here no uhm in Belgaum district one of two
words we can't live without bread 
 Uhm 
I must confess though I don't belong to south but still I too
am fond of idli dosa laughs 
I must say it's very uh it is easy easy to digest
these things 
Then what we have in one word and eat something else for
food 
But I feel that uh ro roti 
prepared out of jowar no and rice it is better than
 idli and dosa a day 
It will be it will be affecting our health
I feel irrespective of all these things some one word
 is there 
Whatever we eat whatever the food or food habits are we
should try to develop such habits
Uh for example what they are 
The fresh 
Uhn
Ones a balanced diet and extra good one salad one
word 
It should be nutrious
Whatever it is 
But don't you think that uh our ances our own
people no our elders uh they used to use turmeric or spices
Uhn
But uh even for using spices there must be some reason
It it had na that it has did have two
words besides having some taste it did add to the taste and colour
of the food 
But it had medicinal medicinal powers also 
For example turmeric
Uhm
A very good anticeptic or asofoetida that also helps
to have stomach one word 
Then garlic 
 Haan garlic is there these things too
But the colours that we uh we use in uh preparations
no it is very injurious to health
But inspite of all that we use it 
Uhn permitted colours laughs 
Yeah one word so they are 
And I think whatever the food that we eat it depends
on the like the place where we're staying 
The state also where it all these things grow 
Wherever paddy grows obviously people will have yeah
 no 
 Yeah 
Then about the timings also I would like to say 
about these habits like in every family what you find is they have a
different schedule 
 Uhn 
Obviously 
So it's better you know in evening one word
 if you eat early 
In the morning also you should try to eat earlier in the night
also if you eat and whatever you eat at night that should be quite
light
Uhn 
Not very heavy 
Now many people they are used to accustomed to eat very heavy
food at night 
That also affects the digestion 
 It's better to have light food at night and uh 
everyday in the morning that's very important
Yes sound health is essential to have sound mind no
Uhm 
Then after all what are your food habits firstly
By the way doing a lecture in a two words the
college timing laughs 
In the morning I go just with glass of milk 
uhn or even a bit of bournvita and snacks or so 
And what we have is tikla prepared of 
wheat 
As a matter of fact a sort of biscuit but it's
 shallow fried 
Then I I come at eleven O'clock that depends on
the classes laughs 
When I return I have my lunch 
Now lunch comprises of what our habit is or you know say a
personal one word in our family 
We have rice daal chapati curry 
little bit of one word one word all this a few
words and all 
 Uhn 
Oh god 
Pickles sometimes that one word laughs 
though especially I shouldn't eat 
Uhm then again in the evening we have tea or coffee one
word 
Then at night also we have a light uh dinner same as
lunch 
And another thing that people avoid is it's very 
it's said that an apple a day keeps the doctor away laughter
 
But what we do many times instead of taking an apple we if
we tell our children uhn they are ready to have cadbury 
which spoils their teeth also uhn and not for food but 
fruit should be one of the most important uh the important uh
food instead of one word that is what I feel
Everyone everyday in any form may be juice or 
cutted cut pieces or best thing is to take apple
 as it is without cutting it
That is what and fruits also you have in different place
 different fruits that you have 
But instead of that many people they try instead of milk
they would like to have ice-cream laughter 
But you see they don't feel what the effects after effects
or adverse effects they they have 
So what do you think what are the fruits that are grown two
words 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
We have banana uhm and I I like it very much
Daily I use the 
 Uhm 
Another thing what I found find is there are few
things which are common whether you go to east west north south 
And one word for you all use dal
 of course pulses cereals everybody uses curry everybody uses 
Vegetable salad everybody uses 
Then in some form or the other milk is used and this food 
curd either they put curd or buttermilk at the end 
So I think that also helps in digestion 
 That's a good habit 
What do you think 
Yes that is true 
I too use milk in our area also people prefer buttermilk 
more than milk
Uhm
I mean the curd and as I told you ghee 
but it should not be used too much but inspite of that uh it is one's
 liking they will use it laughs 
And as far as myself I will have cup of tea in the morning
Uhm
Then at nine thirty I will have some light tiffin at one
 O'clock uhm I'll have my lunch 
And usually I prefer green vegetables bread then
buttermilk 
Then in the evening rice only 
 Uhm 
 One word 
Uhn in the in the evening that is at uh in the evening
so after eight thirty or nine 
Everyday I will have rice then curry then uh 
 one word when I go to sleep I will have a glass of milk 
laughs 
What I what I think is that these food habits should be
developed from the time when the children are very young
Then one word all the people in the house should be
 one word it 
Instead of getting them biscuits or chocolates or juice
 we should try to give them fruits one word or uh 
vegetable salad 
So if we develop that taste from the very beginning obviously
 they will continue through out their life
And they can have good health physical health
But but now a days what is happening no children 
even children are found of parag two words and all
these things one word really it will spoil their health 
And inspite of that the child as soon as it gets up from
the bed no it uh demands for tea only
Yeah
And we can leave without food but uh first we
must have a tea
So I really feel it will kill our hunger 
Ahn that's true 
And in the morning also one thing is that that's uh
 children they have that habit of taking something 
But before that without brushing and all then they go laughter
 and if uh they eat anything that is sweet 
Ah
As I told a few words anything 
So after that atleast once they get up and before
going to sleep one should brush the teeth atleast
Yeah
