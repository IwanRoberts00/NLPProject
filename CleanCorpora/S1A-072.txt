""
""
""
""
No don't you think that  uh uh about this food and food habits
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Generation to generation  family even
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is also there  and it may be due to climate also
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And 
""
""
""
the people they will have 
for their food 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  true
""
""
""
""
""
In north 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But now don't you feel that uh  previously it so happened
""
rice 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh  readymade
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 there
""
""
""
""
""
As  isn't it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And what we feel  food that is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
food and uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 and fresh food is a must for good
""
""
What I feel is  do affect our mind
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
who eat very  hot or spicy food
""
""
Uhn they will be short tempered 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fried things and all  put on weight
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
difficult 
""
""
But what I feel no  uh we people will begin to think up
""
some disease and all  but uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
They will not care about the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
diet 
""
""
""
talking food food habits enough
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For example if you go to Calcutta 
""
""
articulation the food  something quite
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ravindranath 
""
About the eating habit also  they prefer the cheese
""
""
Uhn
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So mostly we used to have that  daal
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh you know  usually people will
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And they prefer more  ghee
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
""
 then rice
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
words 
""
""
""
""
""
I must confess though I don't belong to south but still I too
""
""
""
these things 
""
""
food 
""
""
But I feel 
""
""
""
""
""
""
I feel  one word
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Ones a balanced diet  one
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh even for using spices there must be some reason
""
""
It it had  two
words  it did add to the taste and colour
""
""
But it had medicinal medicinal powers also 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A very good anticeptic  that also helps
""
""
""
Then garlic 
""
""
 these things too
""
""
""
But the colours that we uh  preparations
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""

Wherever paddy grows obviously people will have  yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
different schedule 
""
""
""
""
""
Obviously 
""
""
So  one word
""
""
In the morning also you should try to eat earlier  in the night
also if you eat  that should be quite
""
""
""
""
""

Not very 
""
