 laid down their lives in the last
twelve month 
""
And since nineteen sixty-nine  when six brave policemen
patrolling in Leh 
""
But such acts of courage  the public
image of the police 
""
Ask any ordinary citizen of the country and 
or uh a peasant in a village  and they will tell you
 enchained them at the level
of interaction of the ordinary citizen and the police
""
Why this is so  ?
""
Is change really possible  ?
""
Is it impossible  ?
""
Why things not changing ?
""
Who is at fault ?
""
Who is to blame  ?
""
To answer these and several other question we have a hand picked
and distinguished panel  Mr Soli
Sorabjee  and former
Attorney General  and Mr T Anantchari who is Director General of the
Border Security Force 
""
So you are 
""
You have been a consistant and unsaving critic of the government
 and also of the police
""
And you have said that  been many human rights
violation 
""
Why have you been saying this  ?
""
""
Well uh 
concentrate upon specially  that
the police employ 
""
One of the things which we commonly find is 
third degree method 
""
Sometimes even the  in extracting
statements and extracting confessions 
""
""
""
When even the criminal procedure code  has provisions against
the use of such methods 
""
But in actual practice these constitutional provisions are really
""
""
Then one of the reasons which I find  also
friends in the police force 
""
I know the  we should understand their problems
""
""
But today these criminals are very well armed
""
They have sophisticated technique 
""
So one of the  to give forward is
""
""
 to investigate these cases unless
 we have recourse to these methods
""
""
Mr Jackob is it possible or is it not possible to deal with
hardened criminals  ?
""
""
I think it is a  it is not
suppose to be 
""
But at the same time 
where uh 
""
And may be 
""
We will have to find 
""
""
that we have to have more of  well
trained  of investigation or extracting the
truth 
""
Modern methods will have to be used 
""
Then there will be more simplified 
""
The coarse methods 
""
Sometimes as a hang-over of past 
any thing of that sort 
""
But by and large  a all not a
general complaint
""
It is an image that is projected outside 
""
But  I don't agree that totally it is true
""
But there are cases
""
""
But it is refreshing to have the government admit that uh 
coarse methods are used by the police Mr Anantchari 
""
""
Well I think this problem  discuss in
isolation
""
I would like to  there can be no two
opinion 
""
Police cannot adopt it as a method of  the
method or as a policy 
""
Having such reason I would like to say  police cannot
function diverse from 
""
The legal system 
""
First of all I would like to say when I say cultural  one word
""
""
There is uh  that I am permitted to say
""
We are having double standard in our 
""
They would 
""
They expect something else to be done 
""
 depends on who is affected
and who is wanting to police 
""
I think that is the point  got to understand
""
We cannot run away  totally
""
Secondly  everybody seems to be in great
hurry and want results 
""
And  want results from
themselves they would like to adopt their own method 
""
And then the police becomes uh 
""
This is one aspect of it 
""
Secondly you want to run the society on modern  on
terms of modern terms of modern concept  with a law which is totally
hackneyed 
""
I do not know if very many of us know  the institution
called the FIR  this institution called the FIR first information report
is peculiar to the sub-continent 
""
Nowhere else in the world do you have it 
""
Once you write something in the FIR  it becomes impossible to
""
""
So you will have to 
the evidence to see that what you said in the FIR  uh come through the
investigation
""
I think it is a very 
""
Third is 
you think of police as part of the total criminal justice system 
""
Thus they have the criminal justice system improve
""
""
Has it uh Soli 
""
""
In fact I think that 
""
Improvement in the criminal justice system is nothing to do to 
sanction  from the use of
methods which are not correct 
""
I appreciate what Mr Anantachari has said about the double standard
""
But what he meant by double standards and people want results is
really the 
""
Orders come from political bosses from people in authority  to
see  who is
being investigated 
""
Policemen says 
ho gaya 
""
There are exceptions 
""
There are some bail source 
""
Another way the order comes  when they want their political
rivals to be arrested
""
Order goes to the police station  and the orders are carried out
""
So I entirely agree about the double standards
""
And I think the real  of the
police is the politicisation of the police 
""
And that must stop 
""
Because many unconstitutional illegal commands are carried out 
just in order  not to get into trouble
""
They may be transferred they may be suspended 
""
But criminal justice system has not improved by means  one or
two words 
""
The delays in the criminal justice system  investigation as part
of the criminal 
""
And if the investigation is not covered the investigations is not
 naturally we won't have a sucessful prosecution of the
criminal
""
""
Yeah Soli  politicisation is there
""
""
I was just  uh see through your word
politicisation 
""
Because uh my experience  that there is not
politicisation  people imagine
""
Because every political party come to the police 
""
Everyone has a faith in police 
""
And even in India  the states and states differ in political
systems 
""
So everyone come to uh power 
""
One party or other 
""
And the police had to follow a middle course 
""
They are not 
""
Even if the pressure goes  listening to a
politician 
""
But I see  people or
politicians are relying on the police 
""
Irrespective of  nature of the government
""
I think 
 it
""
But it may not be a genuine case  that there is the
politicisation of the police force in India
""
I beg to differ from 
""
""
""
""
""
Mr Jacob what  saying is that all political
parties manipulate the police 
""
As far as  picking out one
political party
""
What you are saying comes to these all politicians
""
""
No no  I am the
""
""
I think  well independent in their own
investigation
""
""
Well I wish that was true 
""
I don't blame the police
""
""
Mr Anantachari why don't you 
""
""
In fact in fact  appropriately get
an opportunity to 
""
""
You will have it right 
""
""
 because the whole thing arouse out
of my  statement which are in two parts
""
One when I mentioned  justice system and
second about double standard 
""
This double standard  one word
""
""
It is 
it is a neighbour
""
If your house is burgled  so long as his house is not burgled
""
""
When his house is burgled he does not mind the police using any
method to get his 
""
""
""
""
""
So I am only 
""
And I must say  as a well meaning policeman
 as a policeman who would like to live within the system and reform it if
there are reforms required 
""
Uh  this is uh I think which is a
very important uh  factor that hampers the police
""
That is the one 
""
And not this kind of effort 
""
Second I must also clarify  the criminal justice
system 
""
Today  police
role should change 
""
I think the police have to change a lot
""
There is no doubt about it 
""
There are good people there are like any other organisation 
institutions 
""
But 
""
If the judiciary the judicial process has functioned properly and
I am very sure 
""
Today there is so much of tolerance
""
So much of 
""
So much of  uh looseness in the entire judicial process that
you see
""
When I say judicial process  uh
something you will  all the levels
of judiciary 
""
Whether it is prosecution  whether it is defence whether it is
uh  administration of justice
""
So  therefore I feel that police is only one of the links of
""
""
And it is the one that is the cutting edge
""
""
But Mr Anantachari before we loose  track of politicians
 would you say that politicians apply pressure on the police or don't they
 ?
""
""
You see politicians may or may not apply 
""
But it is upto the police officer
""
I  this holding
important charges as SP DIG 
""
Politicians have 
""
They have tried to 
""
But it did not  do and explained to them most of the time they
did not interfere 
""
And if you kept your end clean  I think very few politicians
really try to interfere with you 
""
 a
double game  that is what the politicians wants and what you want to play
""
I 
""
""
""
""
""
I think we repeat itself of course if we say so
""
The fact of the matter is  pressure is a fact
""
And money  don't think even
politician even the  wealthy
people 
""
They do 
""
Let me ask one question 
""
Why is it  that despite of so called failure of the criminal
justic system  a citizen will certainly go with more confidence into a
court of law before a magistrate than before a police  ?
""
Why is it that no woman will dare to go to a police station alone
 ?
""
Why is it that the landless labourers especially the schedule
caste is directed he will not dream of going to a police station ?
""
""
""
The reason is  and I don't say that
""
""
Why do you
""
""
Why 
""
""
""
""
""
I  complete the question
""
The reason is the perception 
""
May be it is an exaggerated perception 
""
But it is there that the police is not our friend and an ally 
police is an instrument  and that system is oppressive
as far as the  deprived sections are
concerned
""
""
Mr Jacob would you  say the police is for the rich
""
""
""
 I am afraid that I
may not be able to agree with Sorabji  I've
""
""
But yes  is almost crowd of
these all these people 
the women 
""
I don't think they are afraid of going to a police station 
""
They don't go to the police station
""
The first thing they will do  is to go to the police station
and report the crime 
""
Then of course we have go to the court
""
So  the police stations are crowded
""
""
""
Correct
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
But Mr Jacob 
non-governemntal organizations  landless
labour  you will get more precise
information and statistics from them  as to how they really fear entering
a police station 
""
""
May be you may be right in saying  but there is no reason
for the fear 
""
But the whole impression that has been built up in some of the
areas is 
""
