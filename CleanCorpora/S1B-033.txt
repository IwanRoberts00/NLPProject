<I>
 One or two words laid down their lives in the last
twelve month 
And since nineteen sixty-nine when six brave policemen
patrolling in Leh were ambushed and killed by the Chinese 
But such acts of courage have not really altered the public
image of the police 
Ask any ordinary citizen of the country and a city dweller 
or uh a peasant in a village or indeed women and they will tell you
 that police have quite sincerely tried to enchained them at the level
of interaction of the ordinary citizen and the police
Why this is so ?
Is change really possible ?
Is it impossible ?
Why things not changing ?
Who is at fault ?
Who is to blame ?
To answer these and several other question we have a hand picked
and distinguished panel Mr M N Jacob state Home Minister Mr Soli
Sorabjee eminent eminent Supreme Court advocate and former
Attorney General and Mr T Anantchari who is Director General of the
Border Security Force 
So you are two words we can start with you 
You have been a consistant and unsaving critic of the government
 and also of the police
And you have said that there've been many human rights
violation 
Why have you been saying this ?
Well uh human rights violation I would 
concentrate upon specially the method and the procedure that
the police employ in investigation at the time of crime 
One of the things which we commonly find is the use of 
third degree method 
Sometimes even the recourse to torture in extracting
statements and extracting confessions 
 There're constitutional prohibition against it 
When even the criminal procedure code has provisions against
the use of such methods 
But in actual practice these constitutional provisions are really
 two words 
Then one of the reasons which I find because I've also
friends in the police force 
I know the one word we should understand their problems
 their difficulties they have to cope with not ordinary criminals 
But today these criminals are very well armed
They have sophisticated technique 
So one of the uhm excuses reasons to give forward is
 it's not possible to deal with harden criminals 
 It's not practical to investigate these cases unless
 we have recourse to these methods
Mr Jackob is it possible or is it not possible to deal with
hardened criminals without using third degree method ?
I think it is a mixed reaction because it is not
suppose to be a torturous method or a third degree method 
But at the same time there do come across some instances 
where uh unwanted methods are also adopted 
And may be it has certain various reasons 
We will have to find the solutions now 
 I I I will project it like this 
that we have to have more of team trained well
trained in this task of investigation or extracting the
truth 
Modern methods will have to be used 
Then there will be more simplified one word 
The coarse methods are rotten 
Sometimes as a hang-over of past when you were not having 
any thing of that sort 
But by and large it's it's a all not a
general complaint
It is an image that is projected outside 
But I don't agree that totally it is true
But there are cases
But it is refreshing to have the government admit that uh 
coarse methods are used by the police Mr Anantchari 
Well I think this problem you cannot uh discuss in
isolation
I would like to say first of all there can be no two
opinion about the need to eradicate third degree method 
Police cannot adopt it as a method of that's the
method or as a policy 
Having such reason I would like to say that police cannot
function diverse from the cultural one word of the society 
The legal system the restrictions that it imposes 
First of all I would like to say when I say cultural one word
 of society 
There is uh that I am permitted to say
We are having double standard in our society 
They would say one thing in law 
They expect something else to be done 
 E it depends on who is affected
and who is wanting to police one word 
I think that is the point we've got to understand
We cannot run away a few words totally
Secondly in our country everybody seems to be in great
hurry and want results 
And when it when they want results from
themselves they would like to adopt their own method 
And then the police becomes uh important hand made 
This is one aspect of it 
Secondly you want to run the society on modern basis on
terms of modern terms of modern concept with a law which is totally
hackneyed 
I do not know if very many of us know that the institution
called the FIR this institution called the FIR first information report
is peculiar to the sub-continent 
Nowhere else in the world do you have it 
Once you write something in the FIR it becomes impossible to
 even the telling the truth to get out of it 
So you will have to often to satisfy the courts add up 
the evidence to see that what you said in the FIR uh come through the
investigation
I think it is a very big 
Third is we must also when you think of police image 
you think of police as part of the total criminal justice system 
Thus they have the criminal justice system improve
Has it uh Soli 
In fact I think that specially is relevent 
Improvement in the criminal justice system is nothing to do to 
sanction tolerate mitigate and absolve the police from the use of
methods which are not correct 
I appreciate what Mr Anantachari has said about the double standard
But what he meant by double standards and people want results is
really the two words of the police 
Orders come from political bosses from people in authority to
see there one of their cousins and one of their friends who is
being investigated two words 
Policemen says baba kya karega order 
ho gaya 
There are exceptions 
There are some bail source 
Another way the order comes when they want their political
rivals to be arrested
Order goes to the police station and the orders are carried out
So I entirely agree about the double standards
And I think the real if I must say so one word of the
police is the politicisation of the police 
And that must stop 
Because many unconstitutional illegal commands are carried out 
just in order not to get into trouble
They may be transferred they may be suspended 
But criminal justice system has not improved by means one or
two words 
The delays in the criminal justice system investigation as part
of the criminal system justice system 
And if the investigation is not covered the investigations is not
 one word naturally we won't have a sucessful prosecution of the
criminal
Yeah Soli politicisation is there
I was just trying to uh see through your word
politicisation 
Because uh my experience I think that there is not
politicisation as people imagine
Because every political party come to the police 
Everyone has a faith in police 
And even in India the states and states differ in political
systems seldom changes 
So everyone come to uh power 
One party or other 
And the police had to follow a middle course 
They are not pressurise by the politicians 
Even if the pressure goes police is not listening to a
politician because it is the system 
But I see the very fact that all the party people or
politicians are relying on the police 
Irrespective of nature of the government
I think though there is some truth sometimes someone may 
 one word it
But it may not be a genuine case that there is the
politicisation of the police force in India
I beg to differ from one word 
 But 
Mr Jacob what you're saying is that all political
parties manipulate the police 
As far as one or two words I am not picking out one
political party
What you are saying comes to these all politicians
No no I am the
I think they're well independent in their own
investigation
Well I wish that was true 
I don't blame the police
Mr Anantachari why don't you one word 
In fact in fact I thought I should appropriately get
an opportunity to one word 
You will have it right now 
 Because because the whole thing arouse out
of my statement which are in two parts
One when I mentioned about the criminal justice system and
second about double standard 
This double standard I related to the cultural one word
 in the society as a whole 
It is if you ask me it is not merely the politicians 
it is a neighbour
If your house is burgled so long as his house is not burgled
 the neighbour will keep quiet 
When his house is burgled he does not mind the police using any
method to get his things howsoever 
 Correct 
So I am only this this runs through our society 
And I must say as a policeman as a well meaning policeman
 as a policeman who would like to live within the system and reform it if
there are reforms required with a high sense of motivation 
Uh I would like to say that this is uh I think which is a
very important uh factor that hampers the police
That is the one 
And not this kind of effort would policeman change 
Second I must also clarify was the criminal justice
system 
Today there is no point uh in saying that uh police
role should change 
I think the police have to change a lot
There is no doubt about it 
There are good people there are like any other organisation 
institutions there are also bad people 
But only thing supposed to be accountable to law 
If the judiciary the judicial process has functioned properly and
I am very sure we'll have very well behaved police 
Today there is so much of tolerance
So much of one word 
So much of uh looseness in the entire judicial process that
you see
When I say judicial process it started it is uh
something you will form to find at all the levels
of judiciary 
Whether it is prosecution whether it is defence whether it is
uh administration of justice
So therefore I feel that police is only one of the links of
 one word system 
And it is the one that is the cutting edge
But Mr Anantachari before we loose track of politicians
 would you say that politicians apply pressure on the police or don't they
 ?
You see politicians may or may not apply 
But it is upto the police officer
I I would like to say that I have this holding
important charges as SP DIG DIG CID in the state various jobs 
Politicians have continued with this one word 
They have tried to also put some pressure 
But it did not do and explained to them most of the time they
did not interfere 
And if you kept your end clean I think very few politicians
really try to interfere with you 
 It's a question of it's it's a
double game that is what the politicians wants and what you want to play
I think both have to one word 
 Soli what is in your experience 
I think we repeat itself of course if we say so
The fact of the matter is pressure is a fact
And money two words politician don't think even
politician even the industrialist capitalist people wealthy
people people who built ill-terms and power 
They do trap 
Let me ask one question 
Why is it that despite of so called failure of the criminal
justic system a citizen will certainly go with more confidence into a
court of law before a magistrate than before a police ?
Why is it that no woman will dare to go to a police station alone
 ?
Why is it that the landless labourers especially the schedule
caste is directed he will not dream of going to a police station ?
 I'm talking of rural areas 
The reason is and I don't say that
Why do you
Why don't you let Mr Jacob 
 A few words 
I I'll complete the question
The reason is the perception 
May be it is an exaggerated perception 
But it is there that the police is not our friend and an ally 
police is an instrument of the system and that system is oppressive
as far as the landless as far as the deprived sections are
concerned
Mr Jacob would you say the police is for the rich
 No I'm I'm I am afraid that I
may not be able to agree with Sorabji though I've I've
 tremendous respect for him as a lawyer 
But yes every police station in India is almost crowd of
these all these people who are who are affected someway or other 
the women the backward the weaker section 
I don't think they are afraid of going to a police station 
They don't go to the police station
The first thing they will do is to go to the police station
and report the crime whatever happened 
Then of course we have go to the court
So I think by and large the police stations are crowded
 and the policemen's workload is also very heavy 
Correct
Uhn 
But Mr Jacob please ask the several NGO's 
non-governemntal organizations who appear on behalf of landless
labour one word workers you will get more precise
information and statistics from them as to how they really fear entering
a police station 
May be you may be right in saying but there is no reason
for the fear 
But the whole impression that has been built up in some of the
areas is landlords vested interest are in cohout with the police
