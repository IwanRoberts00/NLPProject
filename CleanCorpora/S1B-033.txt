<I>
""
""
 laid down their lives in the last
""
""
And since nineteen sixty-nine  when six brave policemen
""
""
""
""
""
""
or uh a peasant in a village  and they will tell you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
To answer these and several other question we have a hand picked
""
""
Attorney General  and Mr T Anantchari who is Director General of the
""
""
""
""
You have been a consistant and unsaving critic of the government
""
""
And you have said that  been many human rights
""
""
Why have you been saying this  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
statements and extracting confessions 
""
""
""
""
""
""
But in actual practice these constitutional provisions are really
""
""
""
friends in the police force 
""
""
""
""
""
""
They have sophisticated technique 
""
So one of the  to give forward is
""
""
 to investigate these cases unless
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
suppose to be 
""
""
where uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
any thing of that sort 
""
""
general complaint
""
It is an image that is projected outside 
""
But  I don't agree that totally it is true
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
opinion 
""
""
""
""
""
function diverse from 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They expect something else to be done 
""
 depends on who is affected
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then the police becomes uh 
""
This is one aspect of it 
""
""
""
""
""
I do not know if very many of us know  the institution
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
methods which are not correct 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ho gaya 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I think the real  of the
""
""
""
""
Because many unconstitutional illegal commands are carried out 
""
""
They may be transferred they may be suspended 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if the investigation is not covered the investigations is not
 naturally we won't have a sucessful prosecution of the
criminal
""
""
""
""
""
""
politicisation 
""
Because uh my experience  that there is not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
systems 
""
So everyone come to uh power 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Even if the pressure goes  listening to a
""
""
""
""
""
Irrespective of  nature of the government
""
I think 
 it
""
But it may not be a genuine case  that there is the
""
""
I beg to differ from 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What you are saying comes to these all politicians
""
""
No no  I am the
""
""
""
investigation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
an opportunity to 
""
""
""
""
""
 because the whole thing arouse out
""
""
One when I mentioned  justice system and
""
""
This double standard  one word
""
""
""
it is a neighbour
""
If your house is burgled  so long as his house is not burgled
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
there are reforms required 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Second I must also clarify  the criminal justice
""
""
""
role should change 
""
""
""
""
""
There are good people there are like any other organisation 
""
""
""
""
""
I am very sure 
""
Today there is so much of tolerance
""
So much of 
""
So much of  uh looseness in the entire judicial process that
""
""
""
something you will  all the levels
of judiciary 
""
Whether it is prosecution  whether it is defence whether it is
uh  administration of justice
""
""
""
""
And it is the one that is the cutting edge
""
""
But Mr Anantachari before we loose  track of politicians
 would you say that politicians apply pressure on the police or don't they
""
""
""
You see politicians may or may not apply 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
did not interfere 
""
And if you kept your end clean  I think very few politicians
""
""
""
double game  that is what the politicians wants and what you want to play
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think we repeat itself of course if we say so
""
""
""
""
politician even the  wealthy
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
court of law before a magistrate than before a police  ?
""
""
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
The reason is  and I don't say that
""
""
Why do you
""
""
Why 
""
""
""
""
""
I  complete the question
""
The reason is the perception 
""
""
""
But it is there that the police is not our friend and an ally 
""
as far as the  deprived sections are
concerned
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
may not be able to agree with Sorabji  I've
""
""
""
these all these people 
""
""
I don't think they are afraid of going to a police station 
""
""
""
The first thing they will do  is to go to the police station
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Correct
""
""
""
""
""
""
non-governemntal organizations  landless
labour  you will get more precise
""
""
""
""
""
for the fear 
""
""
areas is
