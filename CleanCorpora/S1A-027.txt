And how about the trend of the students 
The trend of the students is mixed sir 
 Of the

 high class or of low class
 Higher 
The situation in all the colleges uh do you face this uh
have strike of students no sir in your institution ?
 No sir

secretary

No sir
But uh in government colleges uh they have their own
freedom to be
Even in uh our
Have you seen sir many students you know dancing sometimes 
at the time of elections

And uh almost I think uh political influence is there
Yes
Uh politicians are uh encouraging their students to
get their leaders elected 
 What's going on 
 Students are the instruments for the po 
politicians

Uh this is a great problem nowadays in the colleges that is
 every year when the new boy student comes to the college

But he was a meritorius student 
Student 
Got a thousand one word 
Uh thousand out of
Out of two one thousand two hundred

Such a good boy
He was fine within say four months
Usually these things will take place only in the
professional colleges 
Question arises
But it has been
But 
Now it is followed by Arts and Science colleges
Even in Arts colleges
Even Arts and Science colleges
All in Arts place
It is going on 
Because uh those who are born rich uhm they
are coming to chit-chat
 Uhm 
Yes
Yes 
They are enjoying by the uhm they are
enjoying this uh statistic pressure
 Uhm 
Uhm 
They come to college to only just to spend their time
Yeah to spend their time 
Uh they study is not their primary motive
No 
But when they when they study in schools you know they
are alright 
They are obedient
No even in higher secondary that uh junior college
Ha
They are supposed to be like that 
But uh we do not uh come across such uh problems
Oh you are uh working in the girls school
Yes we because I am working in the girls school I do
not have any such problems over there
In co-education we find problems
My myself too because I am working in an aided uh
higher secondary school
Oh
Uh my management is uh someone who cares more
discipline and law 
For him the result is secondary one discipline is foremost
thing 
We don't have strike and uh these and that 
But even then boys attitude is some changing 
They are able to sense it
Uhm 
And what is your vocational group sir there in your 
addition group

 Malaciest 
And the other one is uh radio TV mechanism

Also 
They can join polytechnic
Ahn okay
For practical and other things of course we do not have uh
 all the facilities that are expected 
But still we send our girls to the nearby polytechnic
Polytechnic
To undergo the practical work 
Are you looking after any business other than profession sir ?
No sir no business
No no business
My sole profession is teaching 
 Teaching 
 No nothing sir 
 Yourself sir ?
I do not have any business now sir 
Once I had but after becoming a teacher you know I wanted
to dedicate my life
Ah yes yes
To the teaching profession
I see 
Formally I was a businessman 
Uh then I didn't have peace of mind 
Of course I could earn a lot
Lot
But after becoming a teacher you know I have the 
happiness rather I have the pleasure 
 You have moreover 
If we have some other business means we cannot do
 full justice to this profession 
 To profession yes certainly 
The every teacher should be like that
Uh but uh most probably nowadays all the teachers I can
say sir are engaged in some or the other in any business
Even college uh professors you know
College professors most of the college professors
 are engaged in business and uh especially in government
colleges
 Yeah yeah one or two words 
Yes in government colleges
Earn a lot
Uhm
And I know one professor uh in Selam who was our
professor also 
He is the owner of a mosaic factory
Oh
Mosaic factory and he is uh earning a lot 
 One or two words 
Yes certainly and uh frequently he goes to Rajasthan 
to buy the marbles
Ahn 
And then he comes back to Selam
Ahn
But actually I doubt uh whether he will be rather 
concentrating on his profession
Profession true certainly he can't 
laughter 
 True 
Because 
As a businessman
Ten days or fifteen days he takes to go and come back 
And uh where will be the time for him to prepare for the
students students very difficult 
 Students 
And uh do you have any of your staff like that sir ?
Yes sir in your college
Yes
Uh
They are uh looking after that business
Uhn
But uh in our college they can't uh have their
involvement in business only
Business uh
We are having a strict vigilance oh whether
they are uh teaching properly oh 
When they are completing the syllabus ah 
Are they going according to the syllabus uhn 
And uh really the we are testing the feedback of the students
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Ah 
 Uhn 
Oh 
If the students give uh gives any complaint 
 uhm or if they place a letter in the suggestion box about the
 performance of the professors in the one or two words 
 Uhn 
 Oh you are having a separate suggestion box 
We are taking severe action 
 Action against the
We are having separate suggestion box which is operated
by the correspondent of our college

And he will take action on this letters 
 That means all these letters uh dropped in the
box goes to the corresponding
Yes correspondence secretary

And uh he will take uh stern and uh sturdious action 
 action uh for the
 Action 
So job security may not be expected there
No uh no it's not like that
They were they will be having proper enquiry 
Enquiry ha
Both the side 
I see ha ha 
Initially they will give warning uhm such
and such comments are coming uhm you have to be careful
 right 
Warning is there
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Right 
There 
Thank God for us uh I think sir laughter in uh 
higher secondary school we do not have such uh such a
problem
 Such uh 
Problem 
Because it's a private college 
And it's a developing institution they want to earn
a status in that district 
So they are trying for that 
And in Tamil Nadu sir why should not we introduce uh
junior college system sir 
 What's your opinion about that ?
Yes well but uh what higher secondary it means it
itself means junior college
Yes of course but uh our uh education minister is not
for that it seems
Uh not means that
He wants to call PG teachers as PG teachers only
teachers only uhm uh he doesn't like to give the
designation designation atleast lecturer
 Uhm 
 Designation 
Lecturer or uh like that laughter 
Do you find any difference between PG one word and
lecturer ?
No no we don't find them uh 
Supposing if it is a junior college you know uh we can have
that designation 
But uh 
Working in 
If it is a school 
Working in a school we can't get that uh 
 A few words 
We can't get that uh
Yeah attractive you mean
Status 
Abstract designation
 That's all what can we say but our work is the
same
