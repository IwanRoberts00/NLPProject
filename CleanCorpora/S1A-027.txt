Yes yes of course

Ah

Not only that it is  at high altitude from the sea

So it is uh very cool

Institution 
""

And how about the 
""
""
The trend of 
""
""
""
""
""
Ha I see ha  ha
""

We can't say we can't justify ourselves that  there are of
 or of low class

""
""
""
""
The situation in all the colleges uh do you face this  uh
have strike of students  in your institution ?
""
""
""
""
""
No it is  impossible
""
We can't do it because we are not allowing  form
 an association

But you you don't allow this union chairman 
secretary

""
""
""
""
No sir
""

But uh in government colleges uh  they have their own
freedom to be
""
""
Even in uh our
""
""
Have you seen sir many students you know dancing sometimes 
at the time of elections

Yes
""
""
Uh  to
get their leaders elected 
""
""
""
""
""
""
politicians
""
""
Ha yes politicians

 every year when the new boy student comes to the college

""
""
They  involve in ragging
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And they are  about to tease
""
""
Uhm 
""

""
""
More affected  by this
""
""
Especially in the professional colleges
""
""

He was fine  say four months
""

Usually  these things will take place only in the
professional colleges 
""
""
Question arises
""

But it has been
""
""
But 
""
""
Now it is followed by  Arts and Science colleges
""
""
Even in Arts colleges
""
""
Even Arts and Science colleges
""
""
All in Arts place
""
""
It is going on

But when they  when they study in schools you know they
are alright

For him the result is secondary one  foremost
thing

We don't have strike and uh these and that 
""
But even then 
""
They are able to sense it
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And what is your vocational group sir there in your 
addition group

""
""
Uh yes yes
""
""
We here sir in our school we have 
""
""
Oh
""
""
And making 
""
""
Oh yes since  a girls high school
""
""
Oh yes yes and 
nursing also
""
""
Nursing 
""
""
Nursing also sir  uh building
maintenance also
""
""
Also 
""
""
They can join polytechnic
""
""
Ahn  okay
""
""
For practical and other things of course we do not have uh
""
""
But still we send our girls to the  polytechnic
""
""
Polytechnic
""
""
To undergo the 
""
""
Are you looking after any business other than profession sir ?
""
""
No sir  no business
""
""
No  no business
""
""
My sole profession is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
I do not have any business now sir 
""
Once I had  I wanted
to dedicate my life
""
""
Ah yes yes
""
""
To the teaching profession
""
""
I see 
""
""
Formally I was a businessman 
""
Uh then I didn't have peace of mind 
""
Of course I could earn a lot
""
""
Lot
""
""
But after becoming a teacher you know 
happiness 
""
""
""
""
""
If we  we cannot do
""
""
""
""
""
""
The every teacher should be like that
""
""
Uh but uh most probably  nowadays all the teachers I can
say sir  some or the other in any business
""
Even college uh professors you know
""
""
College professors  most of the college professors
 uh especially in government
colleges
""
""
""
""
""
Yes in government colleges
""
""
Earn a lot
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And I know one professor uh  in Selam who was our
professor also 
""
He is the owner of  a mosaic factory
""
""
Oh
""
""
Mosaic factory 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
to buy the marbles
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
And then  he comes back to Selam
""
""
Ahn
""
""
But actually I doubt 
concentrating on his profession
""
""
Profession 
laughter 
""
""
""
""
""
Because 
""
""
As a businessman
""
""
Ten days or fifteen days he takes to go 
""
And uh  where will be the time for him to prepare for the
students 
""
""
""
""
""
And uh do you have any  ?
""
Yes sir in your college
""
""
Yes
""
""
Uh
""
""
They are uh looking after that business
""
""
Uhn
""
""
But uh in our college they can't uh  have their
involvement in business only
""
""
Business uh
""
""
We are having a strict vigilance  whether
they are uh teaching properly 
""
When they are completing the syllabus 
""
Are they going according to the syllabus 
""
And uh really the  we are testing the feedback of the students
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh 
""
""
If the students 
 place a letter in the suggestion box about the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We are taking severe 
""
""
 against the
""
""
We are having  separate suggestion box which is operated
by the correspondent of our college
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
Not even principal
""
""
Ha 
""
""
And he will take 
""
""
 dropped in the
box goes to the corresponding
""
""
Yes correspondence secretary
""
""
Ha ha she will look into the matter 
""
""
He 
""
""
Ah he
""
""
Uhm he will be looking into the matter
""
""
I see 
""
""
And uh he will take uh stern and 
 uh for the
""
""
""
""
""
So  may not be expected there
""
""
No uh no  not like that
""
They were 
""
""
Enquiry ha
""
""
Both the side 
""
""
I see ha ha 
""
""
Initially they will give warning  such
and such comments are coming  careful
""
""
Warning is there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There 
""
Thank God for us uh I think sir 
higher secondary school  such a
problem
""
""
""
""
""
Problem 
""
""
Because 
""
And  they want to earn
a status in that district 
""
So they are trying for that 
""
""
And in Tamil Nadu sir why should not we introduce  uh
junior college system sir 
""
 ?
""
""
Yes well  it
itself means junior college
""
""
Yes of course but uh  education minister is not
for that it seems
""
""
Uh not means that
""
""
He wants to call  as PG teachers only
teachers only  uh he doesn't like to give the
designation  atleast lecturer
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Lecturer or uh 
""
""
Do you find any difference between PG  and
lecturer  ?
""
""
No no we don't find them uh 
""
Supposing if it is a junior college you know  uh we can have
that designation 
""
But uh 
""
""
Working in 
""
""
If it is a school 
""
""
Working in a school 
""
""
""
""
""
We can't get that uh
""
""
Yeah attractive you mean
""
""
Status 
""
""
Abstract designation
""
""
 but our work is the
same
