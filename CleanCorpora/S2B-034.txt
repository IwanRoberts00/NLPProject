Tomorrow  is to observe this event we now bring you a talk
entitled 
""
The speaker is Dr Vasanti Rasam 
""
And she is highlighting  the factors responsible for such a low
female literacy 
""
""
Problems of women can be visualised in almost all forms of
system 
""
Neverthless women in socialist nations seem to have come a long way
in achieving equal status to that of man 
""
On the other hand  Indian women have been oppressed in all the
fields at two levels 
""
In educational sphere too  women have been opressed under the
traditional set up of our society 
""
Recently there is a growing tendency towards improving the
conditions of women in India considering them  to be a part of national
development process 
""
The major thrust of the 
""
""
The basic approach would be  to enable women to acquire
confidence in themselves 
towards the overall development and betterment of society  and their
individual personality 
""
All this comes in a country where  horrifying atrocities have
been committed against women since ages 
""
Even fifty years ago 
and subsequent widowhood  were
widely prevalent and are still heard of in rural areas 
""
With independence came  the age of social reform to eradicate
the evils against women 
""
But still today  even if you just scratch the surface of Indian
culture 
""
Where did we go wrong then  ?
""
Why does the Indian women still reveal in stereotype role  of
self sacrifice rather than  ?
""
The blame must surely lie  at the doors of our educational
system  rather than an effective means of
equalising opportunity 
""
Education for girls was  and is still influenced by a wide range
of factors  which are considerably different from those that affect boys
education 
""
It can be noted that girls education at large was encouraged 
and tolerated after an age or after certain standard  it can
do little good or little harm 
""
The notion that education itself whether primary secondary or
higher  was prevalent upto yester years and is still
relevent 
""
This notion  to the external
world and influences 
""
The basic conviction that there is something special about womens
nature  portrayed the
uniqueness of women and hence the difference in the syllabii  of boys and
girls 
""
The rudiments of reading writing a little arithmatic hygiene needle
work  were being regarded as
more than adequate for girls 
""
Once a demand for  education came from the social
reformers  there was also demand for educated
bride 
""
Thereby expanding the aim of education for girls from competent
wife and mother to 
""
The liberational role of education  emphasised by the radicals
had been subordinated to the social goal of  admissal and not
a questioning and an enquiring mind 
""
Here one can note the conflict between the ideals of  womenhood
of our society  which lead to creation of
a certain measure of independent thought  and of
objectivity 
the well maintained differences between the sexes 
""
And  would be
marginalised 
""
This ideological difference continued to be preserved today 
despite the efforts made by various planning commissions  for the
improvement of 
""
 put forth the
view that in no way was education a threat to family life  and that today
 there was a need to break the barriers of the gender based division of
work 
""
This opinion was reiterated  Kothari Commission
""
""
 holds that
inequality of sexes is built in the minds of men  and women through
socialisation 
""
Which was also accepted by the committee on status of women in
India in ninety seventy-four 
""
Of recent 
threw  listed some
laudable goals of education for women also 
""
Despite the above effort  and an increase in the girls
enrollment at primary and middle school level  the percentage of absolute
""
""
Further  compared
favourably with that of boys  seek
admission into higher education  or professional courses other than those
pertaining to medicine 
""
The drop out rate also in case of girls  at middle school level
is much higher than 
""
What then are the specific reasons for such low female literacy
 ?
""
One of course  economic
 where
preference is for educating a son rather than a daughter  who is to be
married off and sent to 
""
The second reason could be classified as ignorance or cultural
biases of society  and the consequent belief that education is irrelevent
to the future role 
""
It may be observed that many parents still hesitate to send girls
to distant or coeducational institution  and are averse to those in which
there are no women teachers 
""
While for the rural women  education is considered unnecessary
 for an urban women it is merely a value wager in the competitive marriage
market 
""
Despite the fact  the
brother is encouraged to take up higher education at all cost 
""
This is due to the influence of nonacademic factors related to
social and familiar expectation  what a girls basic role in life
is to be  but not an enquiring
mind  and who may if she has time work at
most as a teacher or as a clerk 
""
It is also unfortunately true that  even girls at large choose
to believe  or
to compete 
""
Interesting factors that the proportion of women to men at the post
graduate level  which
shows that once women in certain areas are able to break the barriers of
prejudice 
not doubting their aptitude 
""
Indian woman today is caught up in the terrible cross current 
on one hand  model handed down by our
traditional society  she is being communicated by
various agencies 
""
Woman therefore  partially as
she does not take 
""
Those who have an opportunity to get higher education  even as
far as post graduation and doctorate  are not able to decide for
themselves  it would depend once again on the
man  or in-laws to decide for her future after her
marriage 
""
 state of women literacy is improving
 more so in
rural areas 
""
Moreover  educational institutions are not
regarded as institutions for acquiring knowledge and for providing training
for a good vocation  waiting rooms for girls who
are to be married off 
""
Thus the function of education also will  be
""
""
The dilemma casued by the exposure to the external world 
coupled with a need to keep in touch with the notion of female dependency is
result by choosing well demarketed suitable areas  or otherwise called the
safe educational realms of study for girls 
""
The major efforts of the  liberal
 by raising the age
of marriage  and emphasising education as an important means of
emancipation 
""
Yet 
is however undermined or the limit  education
posed by womens role in the family 
""
For all the classes of women  the content in role of education
victory a deep ambivalence between womens role and individual growth 
""
Thus 
women's  of the constitution to actual
reality  education policy must introduce basic issues like as
access or reduction  within
the educational process  which also reflects in employment socio-political
participation opportunities  and competence which
alone can build defences against  exploitation or
oppression 
""
This requires  to take up the task of
changing the attitude and values regarding womens role and rights in society
 economic and
political processes 
""
For this  the educational programme for female literacy needs to
be re-evaluated  in the light of experience of
the bygone years 
""
A general plan for education which is not taken into account 
the specific problems 
""
Thus 
the programmes planned at the ministerial level  translate themselves into
meaningful developmental input
