The time is eight fifteen p m 
Tomorrow is to observe this event we now bring you a talk
entitled Higher education and women 
The speaker is Dr Vasanti Rasam 
And she is highlighting the factors responsible for such a low
female literacy and makes certain recommendation 
Problems of women can be visualised in almost all forms of
system with varying degrees 
Neverthless women in socialist nations seem to have come a long way
in achieving equal status to that of man 
On the other hand Indian women have been oppressed in all the
fields at two levels at the caste and class level 
In educational sphere too women have been opressed under the
traditional set up of our society 
Recently there is a growing tendency towards improving the
conditions of women in India considering them to be a part of national
development process 
The major thrust of the Seventh Five Year Plan 
 was on the development of women 
The basic approach would be to enable women to acquire
confidence in themselves and to develop a sense of responsibility 
towards the overall development and betterment of society and their
individual personality 
All this comes in a country where horrifying atrocities have
been committed against women since ages 
Even fifty years ago female infanticide child marriage 
and subsequent widowhood sati devdasi etcetera were
widely prevalent and are still heard of in rural areas 
With independence came the age of social reform to eradicate
the evils against women 
But still today even if you just scratch the surface of Indian
culture we are exposed to the male dominated society 
Where did we go wrong then ?
Why does the Indian women still reveal in stereotype role of
self sacrifice rather than those of self awareness ?
The blame must surely lie at the doors of our educational
system which is nearly a ritual rather than an effective means of
equalising opportunity and erasing the sex bias 
Education for girls was and is still influenced by a wide range
of factors which are considerably different from those that affect boys
education 
It can be noted that girls education at large was encouraged 
and tolerated after an age or after certain standard at which it can
do little good or little harm 
The notion that education itself whether primary secondary or
higher is harmful was prevalent upto yester years and is still
relevent as far as higher education is concerned 
This notion limited the exposure of women to the external
world and influences 
The basic conviction that there is something special about womens
nature which could be destroyed by excessive education portrayed the
uniqueness of women and hence the difference in the syllabii of boys and
girls 
The rudiments of reading writing a little arithmatic hygiene needle
work embroidery and vernacular language were being regarded as
more than adequate for girls 
Once a demand for women's education came from the social
reformers for their emancipation there was also demand for educated
bride for a new western educated breed of men 
Thereby expanding the aim of education for girls from competent
wife and mother to intelligent companion 
The liberational role of education emphasised by the radicals
had been subordinated to the social goal of willing admissal and not
a questioning and an enquiring mind 
Here one can note the conflict between the ideals of womenhood
of our society and the ideals of education which lead to creation of
a certain measure of independent thought a spirit of enquiry and of
objectivity which as a bind by men of our society could threaten 
the well maintained differences between the sexes 
And they also feared that their control over women would be
marginalised with too much of education of wrong kind 
This ideological difference continued to be preserved today 
despite the efforts made by various planning commissions for the
improvement of female literacy 
 Mrs Durgabai Deshmukh committee put forth the
view that in no way was education a threat to family life and that today
 there was a need to break the barriers of the gender based division of
work 
This opinion was reiterated by the Kothari Commission
 also 
 The Hansa Mehta Committee holds that
inequality of sexes is built in the minds of men and women through
socialisation which continues to be extremely powerful 
Which was also accepted by the committee on status of women in
India in ninety seventy-four 
Of recent the Seventh Five Year Plan 
threw the challenge to education a policy perspective listed some
laudable goals of education for women also 
Despite the above effort and an increase in the girls
enrollment at primary and middle school level the percentage of absolute
 or absolute magnitude as compared to boys is still low 
Further even though the performance of girls compared
favourably with that of boys only a limited number of girls seek
admission into higher education or professional courses other than those
pertaining to medicine teachers' training and nursing 
The drop out rate also in case of girls at middle school level
is much higher than boys 
What then are the specific reasons for such low female literacy
 ?
One of course is poverty where a family's economic
 and financial problem do not give an opportunity to girls where
preference is for educating a son rather than a daughter who is to be
married off and sent to some another family 
The second reason could be classified as ignorance or cultural
biases of society and the consequent belief that education is irrelevent
to the future role expectation of a wife and a mother 
It may be observed that many parents still hesitate to send girls
to distant or coeducational institution and are averse to those in which
there are no women teachers 
While for the rural women education is considered unnecessary
 for an urban women it is merely a value wager in the competitive marriage
market 
Despite the fact that the system has the attitude the
brother is encouraged to take up higher education at all cost 
This is due to the influence of nonacademic factors related to
social and familiar expectation as to what a girls basic role in life
is to be a good bride intelligent companion but not an enquiring
mind but a devoted mother and who may if she has time work at
most as a teacher or as a clerk 
It is also unfortunately true that even girls at large choose
to believe that there can be no fulfilment in combining many roles or
to compete in the male dominated area 
Interesting factors that the proportion of women to men at the post
graduate level is higher than at the undergraduate level which
shows that once women in certain areas are able to break the barriers of
prejudice they proceed to acquire further degree and perhaps a job 
not doubting their aptitude but have mental ability of her mind 
Indian woman today is caught up in the terrible cross current 
on one hand she is a best by model handed down by our
traditional society and on the other she is being communicated by
various agencies negating these morals 
Woman therefore is responsible themselves partially as
she does not take a stance even when she is badly pushed 
Those who have an opportunity to get higher education even as
far as post graduation and doctorate are not able to decide for
themselves to make a career as it would depend once again on the
man her husband or in-laws to decide for her future after her
marriage 
 There's no doubt state of women literacy is improving
 yet as compared to that of male literacy is still low more so in
rural areas 
Moreover even today educational institutions are not
regarded as institutions for acquiring knowledge and for providing training
for a good vocation but as respectable waiting rooms for girls who
are to be married off 
Thus the function of education also will relatively be
 different in case of girls and boys to date 
The dilemma casued by the exposure to the external world 
coupled with a need to keep in touch with the notion of female dependency is
result by choosing well demarketed suitable areas or otherwise called the
safe educational realms of study for girls and avoiding others 
The major efforts of the libera liberal
 forces to improve womens educational status by raising the age
of marriage and emphasising education as an important means of
emancipation cannot be denied 
Yet the liberal view of education as a liberating force 
is however undermined or the limit to access to education
posed by womens role in the family 
For all the classes of women the content in role of education
victory a deep ambivalence between womens role and individual growth 
Thus if education is to play a due role in translating 
women's equality from the pages of the constitution to actual
reality then education policy must introduce basic issues like as
access or reduction and later elimination of gender disparity within
the educational process which also reflects in employment socio-political
participation opportunities for personal growth and competence which
alone can build defences against degradation exploitation or
oppression and lead to self confident individual 
This requires educational system to take up the task of
changing the attitude and values regarding womens role and rights in society
 to one of the equal participation in all socio- economic and
political processes and national and international development 
For this the educational programme for female literacy needs to
be re-evaluated and formulated a new in the light of experience of
the bygone years 
A general plan for education which is not taken into account 
the specific problems faced by women fails to benefit them 
Thus a kind of grassroot input is necessary so that 
the programmes planned at the ministerial level translate themselves into
meaningful developmental input
