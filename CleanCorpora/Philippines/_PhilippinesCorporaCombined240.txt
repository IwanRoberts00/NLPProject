if your honors please uh we received at uh one thirty-five uh this afternoon a copy of the comment opposition to motion to quash filed by the prosecution we note in this comment which the prosecution has filed that they do not dispute the facts on the basis of which the motion to quash is predicated i shall therefore no longer deal with the facts and proceed to deal with the arguments the motion to quash uh is based on no less than the constitution itself particularly article eleven entitled accountability of public officers  under article eleven section three subparagraph six the senate shall have the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment when is there a case of impeachment there is a case of impeachment when pursuant to section three subparagraph one the house of representatives exercises its exclusive power to initiate a case of impeachment  the senate would have no jurisdiction to deal with a matter of impeachment unless the impeachment case comes to the senate from the house of representatives which under section three subparagraph one has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment  so now if your honors please i shall deal with the power of the house of representatives the constitution itself provides as to how the house of representatives may exercise its exclusive power to initiate a case of impeachment this is described and provided for in subparagraphs two three and four of section three article eleven let me first deal with our first ground if your honors please that the house of representatives has not initiated a case of impeachment and that the case of impeachment now before the senate was not initiated by the house of representatives as i have stated if your honors please section three paragraph one says the house of representatives  it does not say one-third of the members of the house of representatives it says the house of representatives shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment  the case of impeachment before the senate was not forwarded to the senate by the house of representatives i have looked at transmissions of bills approved by the house of representatives for concurrence of the senate they are sent by the secretary-general and the secretary-general explicitly states in his letter of transmission that he does so upon instruction of the house of representatives the case of impeachment now before the senate if your honors please and we have appended as annex a of our motion to quash the journal of the house of representatives of november thirteen two thousand  the meeting was called to order the national anthem was sung the speaker read a prayer and immediately he made a manifestation the entire manifestation consisting of a reading of the report of the committee on justice to the house on the verified complaint for impeachment against his excellency president joseph ejercito estrada  there were some attempts on the part of members of the house to raise point of order but they were ignored by the speaker he continued uh to read simply the report of the committee on the judiciary and i call your attention particularly to this portion of the report and this is quoted at page six of our motion the second full paragraph and i quote likewise upon motion which was unanimously approved the body resolved to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of seventy-seven members of the house filed by them apparently in line with the  2 words etcetera  i emphasize if your honors please that what the committee on the judiciary approved was to refer to the plenary not to the speaker to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of course if your honors please at the conclusion of the report it says accordingly the impeachment complaint which shall constitute the articles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement are hereby forwarded to the speaker  this obviously your honors please is not a pronouncement of the committee on the judiciary this perhaps was a statement of the chairman of the committee on the judiciary and if you are to read this and relate this to the portions of the report of the judiciary i have read this would mean that the matter is referred to the plenary through the speaker for further appropriate action now after reading the report of the committee on the judiciary speaker villar simply said and this is i 'm reading from the journal  speaker villar thereafter manifested that since the constitution mandates that when at least one-third of all the members of the house files a verified complaint or a resolution of impeachment the same shall constitute the articles of impeachment  and the duty of the house becomes peremptory and ministerial to endorse it to the senate for trial in the same manner as an approved bill accordingly the speaker directed the secretary-general to immediately transmit to the senate the impeachment complaint constituting the articles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement   you will note if your honors please that even speaker villar spoke of the duty of the house not the duty of the speaker but the duty of the house whether peremptory whether ministerial or by whatever way you describe it the power and to speaker villar the duty was vested is vested by the constitution in the house of representatives and not in the speaker so then it may be asked but what could the house have done one-third is just a matter of counting numbers there can be no dispute about that perhaps none but even the counting of the number is a responsibility of the house and not a responsibility of the speaker but apart from that and perhaps even more substantial i would concede that speaker villar would have no difficulty counting whether there is one-third but perhaps he would have had trouble determining whether the complaint and the resolutions were verified if these were submitted to the house questions would have been raised as in fact these questions were manifested in a subsequent session of the house of representatives as to the adequacy of the verification which appeared in the resolutions appended to the complaint so it is clear the house took no action on the complaint and the resolutions speaker villar merely acted as a post office transmitting it to the senate but the constitution requires that even if speaker villar were to be a post office the stamp had to be placed there not by speaker villar but by authority of the house of representatives that is our first ground if your honors please that is why it is our submission that the case before the senate is not a case of impeachment over which the senate may exercise jurisdiction simply because it has it did not come to the senate by virtue of the exercise the exclusive the exercise of the exclusive power to impeach of the house of representatives now we now go to the second ground while section three subparagraph one speaks of the house of representatives having the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment subparagraphs two three and four describe how the house of representatives may initiate a case of impeachment it provides ways that is described in subparagraph two and that which is described in subparagraph four it is our submission well that what is before the senate has come purportedly pursuant to section three paragraph four which provides  in case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of all the members of the house the same shall constitute the articles of impeachment and trial by the senate shall proceed forthwith proceed  we emphasize if your honors please that firstly the complaint or resolution must be verified and secondly that it must be filed by at least one-third of all the members of the house it 's not disputed that the complaint bef now before the senate was not filed by one-third the number of representatives who endorsed amounted to more than one-third because of resolutions of endorsement which were appended or added to the original endorsers that is after october twelve two thousand the complaint was originally endorsed only by thirty-eight representatives but on november six two thousand the committee on justice took note that there were now seventy-seven representatives so it is not disputed that the complaint was not filed by at least one-third the more important requirement in our view is the requirement that the complaint or resolution be verified it is our submission that this requirement is substantial in nature and may not be dispensed with let us recall that under section three subparagraph two which is another mode of initiating a case of impeachment before the house of representatives not now by at least one-third but possibly by a complaint by a private citizen which is endorsed by any member of the house what is significant up under section three par  subparagraph two is that after the complaint is filed it 's ceasing it is required to be included in the order of business within ten session days and then this is the more important part and referred to the proper committee within three session days thereafter  the committee the constitution provides the committee after hearing and by majority of all its members shall submit its report to the house  etcetera  for what purpose does the committee conduct a hearing well the hul the rules of the house are clear this hearing under its rule three entitled finding a probable cause the hearing is conducted to determine whether there is probable cause evidence is received by the committee for the complainant as well as evidence for the respondent the committee will then determine will then evaluate the evidence and determine whether there is probable cause and after having determined whether there is probable cause the matter is then submitted through a report of the committee to the house for a vote we emphasize this because under subparagraph four where at least one-third of the members of the house file a complaint for impeachment the hearing is dispensed with in other words evidence is not received there is no determination of probable cause but in lieu of that the constitution requires that the complaint be verified why does the constitution consider verification of a complaint by one-third of the members of the house sufficient why does the constitution consider this in lieu of a hearing uh adequate to determine probable cause in our motion we have quoted the provisions of the rules of court which were then enforced in nineteen eighty-seven when the constitution was uh written and ratified verification means taking an oath attesting to the truth of the allegations of the complaint on the basis of one 's own knowledge otherwise stated at least one-third of the members of the house would be saying under oath the allegations of facts of the complaint are true because we know it to be true i would assume therefore i would assume that when one-third of the members of the house say under oath and under pain of perjury that the allegations of the complaint are true that can be accepted in lieu of a hearing let it not be suggested that that would make it difficult for any complaint of imp for impeachment to be passed by the house there is no difficulty because then if not one-third of the members of the house swear under oath that the allegations of the complaint are true of their knowledge then you go to the first method and that is refer the complaint to the committee on the judiciary receive evidence and on the basis of that evidence determine probable cause several seconds pause  i apologize my attention has been called that in the house it is called committee on justice perhaps it is a more appropriate name than judiciary clears throat  now what is the verification we find in the complaint and the resolutions appended to the complaint which is now before the senate the verification reads and i will read the the positive portion  that we have caused the complaint uh that the allegations therein that is in the complaint are true of our own knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent thereto  let me repeat it the allegations are true of our own knowledge and belief but the key clause or the key phrase after that is this on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent thereto  so whoever signed the verifications to this complaint as well as the resolution did not say this uh the allegations of facts are true of my knowledge he says they are true because i believe them to be true on the basis of my reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent thereto indeed nobody knows what these records and pertinent records are they are not identified this we submit is not a verification of fact when one speaks of verification in law it is verification of facts this is not a verification of fact it is a statement of an opinion because when one says based on my reading and appreciation of documents one makes renders an opinion two persons can easily disagree on one how one appreciates a document and now you are talking of seventy-seven persons or even more each one of them could have had their appreciation of documents and these are documents which we are unable even to verify as to whether those appreciations are reasonable enough for them to be accepted because the documents and the records are not identified so we then have before the senate articles of impeachment on the  ar articles of impeachment on which there has been no finding or warrant of probable cause either by evidence or by the oath of one-third of the members of the house of representatives that being the case if your honors please the complaint before the house cannot qualify under section three subparagraph four of article eleven of the constitution let me suggest if your honors please why the constitution perhaps require this it will be recalled that under the nineteen thirty-five constitution perhaps uh the constitution which we have had which was least exposed to partisan considerations other than perhaps our desire then to become independent under that constitution in order that the house of representatives may impeach an official a vote of two-thirds was required and in order that the senate may convict a three-fourths vote was required this requirement has been relaxed
