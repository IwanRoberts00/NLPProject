it got ano din  well yeah ten million pesos kasi di ba her hair is still short there they were they were not still on yet they were not still they 're not in love  when did they do that words  something crazy for the money and then siguro before they got married sabi niya uh something like this i did uh i did this  so since he loved her so much he spent ten million pesos to ge  to buy it from the producer not to have it shown  i bought it in divisoria for thirty pesos by chance see my brother bought see because i was buying network words  see how stupid di ba = isn't it   words  if

know why meron din ganito all cherries wait wait kasi this one 's supposed to be for the soap so it has to be smaller you know naman our soap para it 's easier to pack kasi those those are hard e  cheaper pa pwede itong seventy-nine but this one you can sell it also separately different different designs e  is this cheap na at fifteen pesos you 're selling it at fifteen yeah how much can that be sold pwede pa  no no i mean you 're selling it can that be sold pa higher twenty bucks twenty yeah she can make a lot of that just tell her the size  tama yung sinabi mo may beads kasi she has lots of these e and o  so easy it can be a gift pack also for your jewelry di ba  and it can also be used with other other shades right yes she 's very creative laughs  because she 's words  she 's she she kailangan ma- manifest it has to manifest somewhere her creativity yeah nice di ba  yeah actually she brought three but i know she gave me one only  di ba  different pa yan because she 's lots of  telas these are all what do you call this fabric yeah furniture ano   di ba  washable yeah  di ba you can put anything  kasya ang glasses diyan kasi   when she tried the soap there o it 's so big i think i 'm gonna make it small pero they 're getting it from me uh she has this na e you know what i mean and then  kasya nga pwede  words  of course words really really really really that 's why you know yesterday i 'll tell you a story another tension came into my life  alma my friend from alabang hills i gave her bags also yeah when earlier part of this year lang  so now she has like a balance of five thousand since uh january february  laughs  yeah because i gave her lots of bags to help me you know dispose of yeah so she took it i mean took the responsibility to sell it okay  ano na ngayon november na  every month she tells me she promises me on ganito  i will on november like this on wednesday i 'm gonna pay on like this i 'm gonna pay you and then she was supposed to have paid me yesterday uh-huh so she texted me on that day to tell me i 'm sorry that i cannot deliver today can be my friend ganoon pa siya december five  na lang  december five promise real na  i got for december five daw  me i was calling her na kasi i didn't wanna go texting galore she didn't wanna answer my call kept on ringing her cell phone so so beware i guess anyway there 're a lot of those people around i know i know so i didn't naman force my bags on her e she was the one who who uh what do you call this uh volunteered she was the one who who uh what do you call this uh volunteered sige  i 'll i 'll help you sell yeah  kasi in the process she 's gonna earn  rin naman di ba  yeah so anyway so tagal na yan every month i needed it i mean my point is actually it 's not the money  e it 's five thousand so i told her can you just give me a post-dated check because i also need it  kasi you know what her reason was  i had so many payables i had so many bills to pay so  na- short ako so i have to pay you next month   grabe yan ha   di ba so eto eto nga with me naman when i was i texted her back kept texting her  na i 'm sorry about your problems but i have problems too yeah  i have payables too so i hope you make it a priority   yeah   yeah  can i have a post-dated check tonight i was that blunt what 'd she answer and then then she asked me she was answering me  talagang i 'm so gipit i 'm so gipit gipit gipit or something so me naman i didn't wanna stop there i told her why don't you ask your boy friend to lend you the five thousand and then all of a sudden she tells me don't involve my boy friend because it doesn't involve him  aba siya pa ang mataray   so you know what i said then don't involve me because i don't kasi sabi niya in fact i got lugi  in your bags because my friend didn't pay me and then i said i 'm sorry but i don't know your friend so please don't involve me with your problem with your friend and then she said and then you know she changed the topic what 's five thousand compared to your caprices that 's what she told me and then i you know what i told her everything that i spend for my caprices have been was was uh came from hard work yeah words  i mean if if i only had that cash i wouldn't go spending  grabe itong ano uh san mig nakakatakot  noticing a vehicle swerving into their lane  yeah yeah san miguel  huwag ka na lang lumapit diyan talking to the driver   huwag ka na lang lumapit sa malaking ganyan  i mean if only 'no if only  grabe siya ha   di ba the reasoning was really bad because  words  yeah the reasoning was really bad kasi  imagine he 'd she 'd tell me like that na nalugi na nga ako para bang pasalamat ka tinulungan kita  so she will make pasa to me the problems of the tuition of her kids and all that  kasi she she she uh expected me that i 've so much dough but still if i had so even di ba  yeah even it 's the principle behind it it 's the principle behind it e   sabi ko so how about those i need to pay off where will i get it yeah please help me solve my problem gumanoon ako e  because pinasa ko sa kanya the bola e yeah and then uh kasi i didn't like the tone  e yung yung your caprices kasi  it has nothing to do with it yeah that was not the point yeah the point if you 've been yeah and had i gotten the payment a long time ago i would have made it ikot and made it even probably mo double or triple right exactly right yeah so bottom line was i told her five on december five then five thousand five hundred interest na e i put na interest oh yeah tama tama  ten percent yeah is that okay with you give me a post-dated check tonight i don't have checks that 's what she told me but i promise that december five and then i didn't anymore answer her actually it doesn't  that 's right yeah how 'd you meet her how 'd you meet her naman  family friend yan e  she used to board in our house her sister don't do wholesale i got loko na rin words  no it 's not that e  she 's not the type she 's very naive in fact how many times has that happened once first time a thousand the other one was nineteen i mean but that 's that 's part of the game e  pinks the risk that was the risk i took when i gave her the bags it was the risk i took when i gave techie the bags we have to take risks e  on her end on her end when she gave her friend that that was her risk not mine so don't make me pasa na she has not paid me yet so i can't pay you yeah you have to take responsibility for that e  i gave her how many months already  ano ba naman yung every month she 'll save up a hundred instead of texting all her she she spends around four thousand pesos for cell phone usage and i don't like her reasoning na she doesn't wanna pay me because it 's not her priority because i have money because she doesn't know what i 'm going through you get me it 's like techie it 's not the money yeah that 's why you know what i don't even care if i get that five thousand five hundred e  actually because the ball is on her ano na hand  e  now i can say something about her now she cannot say anything about me na  she can always deny it but my conscience is clear i 've given her so much leeway already i mean i 'm so ano 1 1
