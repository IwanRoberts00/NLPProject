 first few words missing  nursery of the institute of forest conservation at u p l b and with us is dr jose sarjento of the institute  and uh dr sarjento is going to demonstrate to us a very important skill important to our survival 
""
dr sarjento or can i call you joe
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay joe we all know that trees are a very important resource and if only each filipino will be able to plant a tree then that would mean about more than sixty million trees
""
now my question is this
""
would it be possible for elementary school children to be involved in tree-planting activities
""
""
yeah it is very much possible
""
in fact uh tree-planting is fun
""
and it is uh a source of survival
""
it 's a life-supporting activity
""
""
uh-huh because many people believe that uh only adults should be involved in tree planting and uh if you are saying that even small children can do that would you be kind enough to demonstrate to us the different steps in planting a tree
""
so uhm joe what do we have here
""
are these uh common species that uh you use in your tree planting projects
""
""
yes uh this one is uh our national tree
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
this is we call it  narra 
""
""
yes
""
""
 terocarpus indicus 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and the other one this one  is a south american tree
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
 pina matopilla 
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
these are two main reforestation species in the country
""
""
i see
""
could you please show us the different steps to follow in planting a tree
""
""
uh this is the first step is to uh select the planting stock    
""
you have to select uh in terms of uh size     or in terms of age or in terms of vigor
""
  yes  
""
 uh-huh  
""
uh-huh
""
""
so  cough  i would like to show to you the different sizes of     seedlings
""
""
 yes  
""
yes
""
""
for example this is a  narra  seedling
""
""
yes
""
""
another  narra  seedling
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
uh these are three  narra  seedlings
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
uh in in our condition in the philippines   since  we plant this in the mountain     and usually covered with grasses
""
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
yes
""
""
this is the right size of   planting  material
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
uh uhm
""
""
this ranges from ten to twelve months old
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
so this is the right size
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
so if you plant potted seedlings this is the right size
""
""
the things to remember are the size     correct size and the right age
""
""
 the size  
""
the right age and also the the health
""
uh  i 'd like to show to you uh  for instance uh this one this is a  narra  seedling
""
""
yes
""
""
and take note uh that this is damaged
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
this is attacked by insect
""
""
yes yes
""
""
uh be sure not to plant a seedling which is damaged by insect
""
""
yeah
""
""
choose a seedling which is healthy
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
okay
""
""
okay
""
""
this is a healthy seedling
""
""
okay joe once we have selected the seedling what do we do next
""
""
the the the next thing is to prepare for outplanting
""
we have to transfer these in the field
""
""
yes
""
""
and uh for potted seedlings we usually place this in a bag
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
we have to place this in a bag and avoid having this damaged while transporting this
""
""
yes
""
""
now since most of our mountains are already bald and far from the town     we have to transport as many seedlings possible in our bag
""
""
 yes  
""
yes
""
""
so we usually use  uh bare root stock
""
and i would like to show to you later on how are we going to package this
""
""
  uh huh 
""
""
 to   put this in a container     so that we could bring as many seedlings     in the field
""
""
 uh huh  
""
 uh huh  
""
dr sarjento will now show us how to prepare and pack the seedlings for transport to the planting site
""
okay joe
""
""
okay 
""
i have here seedlings of mahogany
""
""
yes
""
""
and uh this is bare root seedlings
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
this is a potted seedling
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and this is uh  this is heavy to transport
""
""
  yes 
""
""
 if you 'd   like to transport     fifty or one hundred seedlings to the planting site
""
""
 yes  
""
right
""
""
but this is lighter     because there are no soil uh covering this
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh-huh
""
""
and i would like to show to you how to prepare this
""
first we 'll start with the root system
""
  we 'll cut  the top root
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
yes
""
""
okay
""
""
yes
""
""
and next is to remove
""
""
  some of the leaves 
""
""
 some of the leaves       so that the transpiration will be minimized
""
""
 yes  
""
uh uhm
""
""
okay 
""
we 'll ah reduce this
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
and uh  once you have reduced this     more or less you will have a balanced uh root system     on the top
""
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
uh-huh
""
""
okay
""
""
okay
""
""
and uh once you have done this   we 'll  we 'll bundle this and uh this is a bundle of about fifty     fifty seedlings     of mahogany
""
""
 yes  
""
 uh-huh  
""
 yes  
""
yes
""
""
and  cough  when you bundle this make sure that the root collar will be at the same level
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
okay like this
""
""
yes uh-huh
""
""
so the root collar are almost at the same level
""
""
yes
""
""
and when you plant make sure that the root system is uh protected by way of keeping it moist
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
okay to keep it moist we need a moist retention medium
""
we have here uh clay     and we just mix it with water     and now we have mud     and this will keep the  so  the root system moist for some time
""
""
 yes  
""
 uh-huh  
""
 yes  
""
uh-huh uh-huh
""
""
so to  on 
""
""
so you cover the root
""
""
once you have prepared the mud
""
""
yes
""
""
we dip this in the mud     up to the root collar only
""
""
 i see  
""
uh-huh
""
""
because if you dip this deeper up to this portion     this will cause the rotting     of the stem
""
so make sure that     only the root system
""
and once it is uh deep in the in the mud     we put this in our banana this is a banana sheet
""
""
 yes  
""
 uh uhm  
""
 only the roots  
""
 uh-huh  
""
yes
""
""
cover this like this
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and then we tie this
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
elmo kindly could you please help me
""
""
so that 's another use for the  saha 
""
""
yeah okay
""
take note that these are degradable materials     'no  
""
""
 yes that 's right  
""
""
plastics are generally non-degradable
""
""
yes uh-huh
""
""
so the most important thing is the method and the materials  will be environment friendly
""
""
yes right
""
""
okay 
""
now we are in the planting site and the first thing to do in when you reach the planting site is to make sure that the site is properly prepared  'no 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
we have cut the grasses weeds and then placed a marker for every planting spot okay
""
""
uh uhm yes
""
""
now before we plant i would like to show to you the the seedlings that we have just prepared and transported
""
""
so you start with the bare root   seedling 
""
""
 and uh   i will start with the bare root seedling
""
i 'll pick up one     this one and i would like to repeat this is the root collar
""
""
 yes   
""
uh uhm
""
""
and when we plant this seedling make sure that you plant at this level only     when you plant bare root seedling we could use a simple stick
""
""
 yes  
""
uh uhm
""
""
or if you have a crowbar we do it like this
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay 
""
we we call this as a slip method
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
because after removing the the the bar     we just insert this     and we could just stamp it with your  with your uh foot     and then put a marker
""
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
uh-huh
""
""
okay
""
""
what is the correct distance between the seedlings
""
""
normally the correct distance varies from one meter     to two meters
""
""
 yes  
""
uh-huh
""
""
it depends on the species
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
for  narra  or mahogany the recommended spacing is two meters by two meters
""
""
two meters by two meters
""
""
yeah
""
""
so it 's  rel  it 's really a very simple procedure
""
""
yes yes
""
""
okay
""
""
the next thing that i will demonstrate is how to plant a potted seedling
""
""
okay 
""
""
now we have have a seedling of  narra  and take note that we have here uh the the soil covering the root system
""
""
okay
""
""
and make sure when you plant this     minimize the destruction of the bowl of soil
""
""
 yes  
""
uh-huh
""
""
so first we dig the soil
""
""
yes
""
""
okay 
""
make sure that the depth of the of the hole is similar to the height or the depth of the root system
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
and so we 'll try this like this but of course one important thing to do is to remove the the plastic or the the coverage uh because this is generally non-degradable
""
""
i see
""
""
be very careful     not to damage the root system
""
""
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh
""
""
okay
""
this is the root collar and this is the whole root system
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
put it like this
""
""
yes
""
""
and  normally we put put  word  soil
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
like this  'no 
""
""
yes
""
""
this is usually darker
""
""
yes
""
""
put this first
""
""
uh-huh 
""
""
and then put the soil
""
""
okay
""
""
cover this properly
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
make sure that the bowl will not be destroyed or damaged
""
""
yes yes
""
""
okay
""
""
uh-huh 
""
""
so the planting is finished
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
but there is one important thing that we should remember
""
""
yes
""
""
we should take good care of this
""
""
right
""
""
we don't we don't leave this like this because like a new newborn babe     it needs care and protection
""
""
 yes  
 that 's right
""
""
first thing to do is make sure that the weeds  will be removed most of the time
""
""
yes
""
""
and make sure that if there are insects coming in     they should be protected
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
there are now various ways of doing this how to protect this
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
but the first thing to do is make sure that the weeds are not covering     the plant
""
""
 i see  
""
uh-huh so joe does it mean that the children would have to come back     to the site from time to time
""
""
 yes  
""
yeah especially during the first three months     they should come here every month
""
""
 yes  
""
uh-huh
""
""
and they should consider this as a good exercise because tree-planting is fun
""
""
yes
""
