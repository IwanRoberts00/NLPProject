""
""
how are you
""
""
i 'm fine
""
i 'm always fine
""
""
oh really
""
nice of you to be fine
""
you don't have a class anymore
""
""
i don't have a class since it is my break time
""
""
oh is that so
""
so what was your last class
""
""
my last class well  technical writing 
""
""
oh what is it all about
""
""
what is it all about
""
isn't it that you are teaching  technical writing
""
""
so why do you still have to ask me
""
""
oh yeah just kidding
""
you know i 'm almost  words  exhausted 
laughter     words  
""
sorry
""
""
 you 're joking me  
""
if there is somebody who is going to ask about  technical
writing  it should be me since sometime uh uh  ano 
so that i could even    words  
  yeah yeah yeah yeah i understand that  
""
but anyway what part of  technical writing  i
mean uh the course outline have you tackled already
""
""
i 've tackled already so far we have talked about uhm the
definition
""
""
  okay 
""
""
 we talked about   the properties
""
""
uh-huh
""
how many properties did you talk about
""
""
well i could not remember everything anymore but i made sure
that i was able to talk about the properties starting with  a
 up to mention> z 
""
""
oh i believe that well in my own understanding since you know
i 'm also teaching the subject right
""
i think the properties are very important isn't it
""
what do you think
""
""
it is very important that 's why i told them that they 're not
supposed to memorize it only but you also have to apply all the things that
you have learned from the properties
""
""
me too
""
we have the same you know you know okay
""
""
what else well what we are going to talk about right now
""
""
 words 
""
""
 words  ask questions about pertaining this
subject because i 'm not that knowledgeable
""
""
sure anything
""
""
well i 'm gonna we are going to talk about properties what
else other things that we are supposed to talk
""
""
well i believe that you have to proceed now with the basic uh
techniques because these basic techniques support your lesson in properties
""
you know uhm properties actually the concept of studying the
properties is  to achieve appropriateness
""
now in line with appropriateness we have to see to it that the
students may also know how to achieve appropriateness
""
so i advise you  ha  i advise you to tackle the
basic techniques before the prelim exam
""
""
okay so
""
""
do you have do you have a note on that
""
""
i don't have a note but then whatever are the things that i 'm
teaching about  technical writing  i usually refer it to
 from from my two sources which are uhm the  basic technical
communication 
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
oh yeah
""
that 's like a book that 's   that 's a nice book 
""
sorry
""
""
  words   
""
so i consider that to be a reference book in this subject
""
""
yes yes sure
""
the other one how about the other one
""
""
the other one i forgot the title uh 
""
""
it 's here    technical writing  
""
""
  technical writing    by
 word   soria and mogol   word 
""
that 's also nice
""
""
yeah it seems complete
""
""
well so far i don't have any difficulty teaching yet because
we haven't tackled yet those uhm difficult things that need to be tackled
about
""
""
  okay 
""
""
 so   at this point in time i 'm still having some
time uh teaching about that because it 's quite easy at this very moment
""
""
well if you find some difficulties in the future just  if
you need my help just approach me okay
""
who knows i may able to help you with that okay
""
so let 's help one another
""
""
one one more thing apart from apart from uhm those things that
i 'm supposed to teach them
""
what do you think are the best projects that i should require the
students    words   to apply the properties
that they have learned   from this  subject
""
""
oh  that 's a nice question  
""
 okay  
""
uh for me uhm they have only one project for that subject
""
they 're going to bring a finished product
""
a finished product which they did not buy from the market
""
""
what do you mean by that
""
""
okay uh one of the basic techniques that we will tackle is
about description of a process
""
""
okay
""
""
okay now in that description of a process you will be learning
the different procedures to finish something
""
now uh in line with that i am requiring my students to bring with
them a finished product but this finished product which will be their project
is related to their course like for instance uh  uh  a  wall
decoration or a lamp
""
""
okay
""
""
and they could try to assemble that using the so called
materials so our agreement is this they can buy the materials from the market
but they need to produce their own
""
they have to come up with a lamp or they may have to come up with a
wall decoration or they should come up with an electrical project anything
that has something to do with reports and this may be the application of all
the things that they learned in  technical writing 
""
why
""
because in the matter of presentation they have to apply unity
coherence organization and of course logic
""
""
okay so
""
""
that is one project that actually i only require them to
submit one project  e 
""
""
but apart from uhm apart from the requirement that they are to
supposed to pass
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
are are they supposed to also explain about that particular
  project 
""
""
 yes   definitely they have they have to explain it
they have to to present to the class the methods that they followed the
materials that they used okay and then the way they  assem  assembled
that particular project
""
""
what about the proposals
""
what can you say about that
""
""
in terms of proposal because you know there is already this uh
this trend right now that they are not making their own proposal
""
they just they are just asking somebody else to do it for them
""
so in terms of proposal i am not sure whether they can finish that
or they do this all by themselves or they just ask somebody else to do it for
them
""
""
so you you feel then that it is not good for you to require
them to make a proposal
""
""
it 's not that it is not good but i think it 's not the best
way of knowing whether they learn something from  technical writing
 or not
""
but you can also do that provided provided  ha  take
note of this provided that these students will be doing their proposal inside
the classroom
""
but the problem is how can they gather data 
""
""
so meaning you still have to send them out   for for
data gathering 
""
""
 yes  
""
and then they have to show me the gathered data
""
""
but then from my own point of view uh if there 's one thing
that they should really learn about is on how to make a proposal
""
""
  yes of course 
""
""
 because   once they become professional uh they
would be required to   make a proposal  and that 's one way of
generating money for their uhm for their boss
""
""
 uh-hmmmh  
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
because if ever they come out with a big proposal they might
be assured of a business that would yield profit to the company that they are
working for
""
""
i uhm you have a point you have a point and i would like you
to think about that you know because you have a point okay
""
now the the problem is you know i i would like to require them to
make a proposal but the problem you know is that  perhaps they have to
defend the title present the title and defend it otherwise i will not be sure
whether that particular proposal is  had been written by somebody else or
they just bought it somewhere
""
so perhaps the best way that we can do right now if you want them
to make submit a proposal is that they have to present a certain title
""
""
okay now uh i scanned the syllabus and i found out that uh
you did not include  words 
""
i found out that you did not include  report writing
 as part of the uh syllabus
""
""
is that so
""
that 's the last part of the
""
""
there are there are some portions there  there 's a
portion there wherein uh there is a need for you for them to uhm study about
report
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
but then i found out that uh there was no specified report
that they are supposed to  words 
""
""
okay
""
""
like for instance  annual report   
 word   report
""
""
 okay  
""
you know the reason for this is i was thinking of the time the
time frame that i think that for me  ha  for me what i 'm
doing is that after i have already finished discussing the steps the tendency
is i usually let them make a scope but that is not a project it 's just an
assignment
""
it 's the application of the five steps
""
""
and you feel that uhm you 're not you 're not supposed to
dwell on that particular topic
""
""
i can
""
""
because you feel it is not that important compared to other
""
""
no no no no
""
i am not saying that it is not important but what i 'm telling you
is it 's not supposed to be treated as a project
""
it is supposed to be a uh an assignment
""
""
an exercise
""
""
an exercise yes because if it is a project you know they are
good  e  they are very good in in buying copying something
especially now that we have the internet
""
they all they just get it from somebody else but i i require i
require them to do a proposal i require them to present a progress report a
preliminary report in the sense that it is just an exercise
""
""
okay one more thing
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
uhm i 've noticed from my students that they are not that
motivated in studying  technical writing  maybe because
they felt that it is not uhm useful to them
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
now in what way could i be able to motivate my students in
such a way that uhm they are going to study and be interested in the subject
matter
""
""
uh okay so that 's the point
""
now let 's see
""
in the introductory part of the subject i always pinpoint the
significance of  technical writing  in their chosen field
of specialization
""
and i always tell them that actually  technical writing
 is a boring subject
""
""
okay
""
""
why because you need to well let 's say they 're not gonna
memorize it but they have to understand everything by heart
""
isn't it because we 're talking about the principles
""
now but to motivate them  okay to like the subject so that 
i have to i always emphasize to them the importance of this because they
cannot perform their work in the future without knowing how to prepare
technical reports because this is half of their their lives when they become
professionals
""
this will be half of the profession that they 're going to tackle
and the work that they 're going to do
""
and another thing is that i always tell them that 
technical writing  is a preparation of the  thesis writing
 they will have when they will be in a  year 
""
and i always emphasize to them that they cannot graduate unless
they have to write a thesis
""
and for them to come up with an effective and complete thesis they
need to study  technical writing 
""
""
and that 's good  ano  you
""
""
  yes 
""
""
 you   you require them the uh proposal in
accordance with  words  in accordance with their courses
""
but then since we are talking about  technical writing
 we at times encounter students who are having difficulty writing
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
so naturally uh since some of the problem that they are
encountering uh deals with grammars
""
""
okay
""
""
we at times go back to the basic     which
sometimes eat most of our time
""
""
 yes  
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
now what do you do with those students who dos not even know
how to write simple english or sentence
""
""
well well that 's a problem but you know sometimes if that 's
the case uh i have to i have experienced tutoring students
""
""
that 's a good  word 
""
""
it 's very very hard but you know i cannot blame the teachers
in in their previous english subjects because you know he cannot cater to all
right to all sixty students right
""
so there will always be this problem but you know sometimes we
have to spend extra hour and extra patience you know not only teaching their
subject but also going back to this particular uh grammar thing because they
cannot write without knowing their  word  so that 's the
only thing i can offer them
""
it 's just to tutor them with  word  past
subjects especially in grammar
