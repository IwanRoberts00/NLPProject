""
""
 ano  uh chinese school  di ba  is it different from a philippine setting   kasi ang 
""
""
it 's different in such a way that when you uhm in our school   actually 
""
""
  oo   
""
""
in our school it 's not the same in another   in other chinese schools 
""
""
 chinese school in greenhills   in manila
""
""
no it 's it 's in quezon city
""
""
uh quezon city
""
""
so in the school where i teach
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
it 's only on a half-day basis because all the english
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
filipino subjects are   in the  morning and then in the afternoon they take chinese chinese lessons
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uhm half-day basis regarding the subjects being taught
""
""
yes
""
""
but not on your
""
""
no not on the loads actually
""
""
not on the  oo  not on the hours of service
""
""
yeah because it 's still regular load
""
i i handle a regular load
""
""
but you receive a good pay
""
""
good pay good pay could you consider that a good pay  be paid
""
""
yeah
""
""
i can't
""
""
 baka naman  i am receiving a lesser amount even if  sa akin 
""
""
i am not sure because i am getting eight thousand for a half-day work four to five hours of work
""
""
but but you stay until
""
""
no   i can leave 
""
""
 five four  
""
you can leave as long as you   have  finished the five hour service
""
""
 my  
""
i 'm from seven thirty to to twelve thirty
""
""
that 's it
""
""
that 's it   and i can go home 
""
""
 and then   you 're receiving eight thousand
""
""
yes
""
""
that 's good enough  kasi 
""
  but you 're not required  to go back
""
""
 yes i think so  
""
to stay
""
""
to come back in the afternoon
""
""
no
""
""
to stay until
""
""
no
""
""
until you consume eight hours
""
""
no not really
""
""
that 's good enough
""
""
that 's that 's that 's the reason why i took the job
""
""
 oo 
""
""
otherwise i wouldn't have taken it
""
""
 oo oo  and then in the afternoon you 're free to do what   you want  to do
""
""
 yes  
""
i 've   i have other rackets 
""
""
 you can have your tutorial  
""
""
yes that 's it  i have
""
""
business
""
""
i do tutorials and  act  before i used to teach at speechpower
""
it 's only this summer
""
""
but i 'm interested in speechpower
 is it good to teach at  speechpo  speechpower
""
""
good to teach good exposure that is   experience-wise yes 
""
""
 why good exposure    kasi  i have been uh wishing ever since i was young uh uh ever since i was twenties early twenties
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 na  i 'll be connected to speechpower
""
""
oh really
""
""
but    af  uh up to now  i haven't really tried it
 never
""
""
 why don't you try  
""
well now they 've already
""
""
 kasi 
""
""
they have already started their their classes
""
""
uh-uhm
""
""
last week of march
""
""
no i want to teach   not  to enroll as a student
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah that 's it
""
""
oh
""
""
they 've started
 actually what you could do is to apply they have their  applica  they open their applications on january
""
""
uh january
""
""
december december   as early as december 
""
""
 uh december  
""
do do they  ano  do they encourage part-timers
""
""
that 's actually what they do
""
""
uh   so you don't have any benefits 
""
""
 actually all the other teachers there  
""
no we don't have any and we are we are being paid by the hour also
""
""
 oo oo 
""
""
so the number of subjects that you handle or course we call it course the number of course the the the compensation depends upon the
""
""
 oo 
""
""
the number of of loads that you  ha  handle
""
""
do you receive  ano  uhm trainings
""
""
yes yes that 's it   one of the benefits 
""
""
 oh that 's what i want  
""
""
for one uhm before you could even handle before you start handling classes
""
""
 oo 
""
""
you have to go through a training because you have   to imbibe 
""
""
 for free  
""
""
yeah   you have  to imbibe their  metho    methodology 
""
""
 wow  
""
  oo oo   
""
""
they will it 's like brainstorming you
""
""
 talaga 
""
""
 oo  to use their method
""
""
have you acquired something from them i mean
""
""
yes
""
""
that you could use for your own personal business like   tutorial 
""
""
 actually  
""
  actually the methodology 
""
""
 you are doing it now  
""
""
yeah
""
""
 talaga 
""
""
the methodology   is really  manageable  
""
""
 how i wish   i could be connected at   speechpower 
""
""
 that 's that 's   what i 've been telling you about when it comes to exposure experience   because once you  once you mentioned the name of speechpower it 's it has a  pre  it 's prestigious   in a way 
""
""
  oo oo oo   
""
  oo oo oo   
""
""
'cause once you say speechpower i came from speechpower   actually 
""
""
 compare to other    speechpo  uh uh
""
""
speech
""
""
speech    cour   i don't know speech   schools  offering speech  oo  courses
""
""
 schools  
""
 centers  
""
they i think they are the one of the most famous   i think 
""
""
 uh uh   the most uh reliable  chuckle 
""
""
well yes because that 's because we have to   go  through a certain training
""
""
 school  
""
 talaga 
""
""
yeah
""
""
how much do they pay   their training instructress 
""
""
 uh on that part   it 's not too much
""
""
at least
""
""
i   was only getting 
""
""
 per load   per unit
""
""
it 's a per per hour basis
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
i was getting eighty then
""
""
eighty per hour 
 in other schools
""
""
in other in other colleges
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
they also pay well as low
""
""
as as lower than eighty
""
""
no i think as low as
""
""
or at least near to eighty
""
""
near eighty
""
""
but i don't know of any speechpower schools  na  near  sa  rizal tanay rizal
""
""
i think the   nearest that you could go  to
""
""
 there 's one in cainta  
""
""
no no   no 
""
""
 none  
""
""
the nearest the nearest speechpower
""
what  someone approaches the speakers 
""
yeah  the one who approached asked a question 
""
nothing we 're just doing this  break in the recording 
""
""
speechpower school
""
""
the nearest speechpower
""
""
in our to our province tanay rizal
""
""
 nyek  the nearest is in cubao
""
""
 ay  that 's too far
""
""
that far but my goodness that 's one ride one one ride  di ba  one ride from tanay is it
""
""
no
""
""
there is
""
""
you go to antipolo first and then you ride another jeepney
""
""
 niye  it 's too   far 
""
""
 right  
""
i thought there 's one in antipolo
""
""
i don't know maybe it 's a different school
""
it 's uh i probably i don't know if they have   they have 
""
""
  oo nga e   
""
""
or maybe
""
""
 kasi    that 's what i 'm  after uh
""
""
 one of the branches  
""
because they go from place to place
""
""
 oo   nga e  
""
""
 i mean   uh from last year they have given up or i think it was two years ago they 've they have given up their their branch in caloocan
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and then in lieu for in lieu of the  ano ba 'to  branch  na 'to 
""
where was that
""
in  bi&ntilde;an
""
""
uhm
""
""
there 's another one in bi&ntilde;an
""
actually what they do is that they go to a certain   school 
""
""
 uh uhm   uh uhm
""
""
and then they try to they they rent the place
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and well they  hav  i think they have an ex-deal wherein they 're also going to train the teachers in that certain school
""
""
uhm
""
""
so in the south the there 's the golden valley school of bi&ntilde;an
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and then next to that the nearest spot is that of taft
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
the one in taft
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and then  the one in in espa&ntilde;a
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
the more regular ones the ones that do not close are the ones in espa&ntilde;a and then cubao
""
those two uhm they don't they  don  they they 're they are it 's always there
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
because that 's where their the two links how do you say that links i suppose are and then
""
""
what year what year were you connected
""
""
i started at   uhm summer of 
""
""
 did you   work on
""
""
nineteen ninety-three  oo  summer of ninety-three
""
""
so that 's seven years ago
""
""
yeah but uh this year i didn't teach
""
""
what about uh if you enroll as a student do you pay   uhm  that much
""
""
 now  
""
at four thousand
""
""
four thousand of what
""
""
at it 's at four thousand
""
""
for how many units
""
""
no that 's that is twenty-four hours spread out 
""
""
uhm
""
""
 parang  two  two hours per meeting per session
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
normally it 's two to three
""
""
hours
""
""
two to three days a week
""
""
uh two to three days
""
""
a week
""
""
a week 
""
""
so you finish the twenty-four hour session     in four weeks or if it 's a two hour session in two uh two days for two days in a   week 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
that is that 's that would  stretch out for six weeks   yeah   oo  six weeks  ay 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
oh so it 's it 's different from any regular school i mean  th  the way they handle the subjects
""
""
uh yeah
""
""
the way they offer the   subjects 
""
""
 yeah different   quite different quite different   and they have 
""
""
 and this is   not the same with the other regular  sch  regular schools uh which offer
""
""
very different   very  different   except that it 's 
""
""
 uh  
""
 twenty-one units   and then you attend regularly daily or m w f t t h no
""
""
no
""
it is you have a regular schedule though
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
you go on   regular schedule 
""
""
 but shorter  
""
""
yeah because it 's just    word  in our profession 
""
""
  kaya lang    i would be wasting four thousand
""
""
oh why don't why don't you just apply
""
""
just apply   and  be a teacher
""
""
 yes  
""
yes
""
""
and then acquire
""
""
undergo training   for free 
""
""
 the methodology  
""
""
and then you also take you 're also you have the privilege to take one course
""
""
uh uhm
""
for free
""
""
for free
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
during the time that you 're teaching
""
so you just find time to attend and they would even encourage you to attend
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
some of their courses
 in something like if you have if you if you have free time ask the consultant we call ourselves     consultants
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
you just ask the consultant if you could  si  uh sit in for one or two sessions     just to just to observe
""
actually they they encourage newcomers to observe the     the old comer the old comers the old ones the old timers
""
""
 uh uhm  
  the old ones  
""
where is the  ano  where is the the main office or the main
""
""
the main is that
""
""
main office
""
""
cubao
""
""
uh cubao the one that you   mentioned a while  ago
""
""
 the main office   yeah
""
that 's the main because that 's their building
""
""
probably they know if there are other branches aside i mean
""
""
 oo  really
""
""
in what areas the other branches are located
""
""
yeah yes you may do so
""
""
so i could probably ask   if there 's one in antipolo  i 'll be
""
""
 and they would even tell you  
""
they would even tell you to go to this place it 's nearer your place
""
""
 oo 
""
""
it 's basically the same
""
it 's our branch
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
they 'll tell you that
""
""
but uhm  ano  t   commonly how many units do they give a a consultant as you call yourself
""
""
it depends
""
""
it depends
""
""
 oo 
""
""
as long as you can handle the number of units
""
""
because i used to handle before i was given a an eight to five
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
eight to five job like it 's from eight to ten then ten to twelve then we have a break from twelve to one and then one to three three to five
""
that 's how it is
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and then when i was already in i think on my third year they gave me an eight to eight job
""
""
huh   my god 
""
""
 because that   depends upon the vai availability of the consultant
""
""
and yet you don't have any benefits even if you have been teaching for that long already
""
""
none because teachers just come and go consultants come and go 
""
""
so you 're not  qualif  i mean you 're you 're your status is not on a permanent basis   but just a part-timer 
""
""
 it should be on a permanent   basis
""
""
ahhh
""
""
that is if you are one of the one of the what do you call them operations manager
""
""
what do   you mean 
""
""
 if you 're   one of the operations managers then
""
""
you share a
""
""
you are
""
""
a capital  laughter 
""
""
no not really
""
you 're the you are the what do you what do they call them
""
little j ms j m the owner the owner   the founder 
""
""
 junior manager  
""
""
no no no the founder
""
""
uh
""
""
the founder owner of speechpower  the j m  jun 
""
""
i don't know
""
""
there he 's joe mordano the little j m because they do the they call the shots
""
""
how i wish there were there 's one in antipolo   so i could probably  work as a part-timer
""
""
 if there 's if there is   another one
""
if there would be a new one
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
you know what is rewarding is the experience
""
""
 oo    that 's what i 'm asking for 
""
""
 you 'd be exposed to   the experience to the modules and besides this is about what is good at speechpower that 's why i stayed that long
""
""
how many years did you work there
""
""
well six six
""
""
uh six years
""
""
six not uh continuously  ha 
""
""
 oo 
""
""
because during the regular school year i go to my to   regular school  during summer 
""
""
  ay  no wait wait wait may i   interrupt you
""
""
uhm
""
""
not speechpower in antipolo
""
it 's it 's it 's s t i  pala 
""
my goodness 
""
 oo kasi  i know of one my my former or rather  oo  my former school  uh  no no no she   was 
""
""
 colleague  
""
""
yes
""
""
colleague
""
""
