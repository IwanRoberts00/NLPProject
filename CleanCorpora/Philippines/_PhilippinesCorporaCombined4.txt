it 's called u b c capital corporation it 's an investment house and you 've been with them for how many years well i started out working at the union bank since nineteen eighty-eight up to your word   up to now  the the we left the investment house for we were the investment bank division in the bank and we formed the investment house we left the investment bank to join the investment house so practically speaking we built that on the purpose of word  okay so i 'll be starting on your life before you became a public figure are you saying when i was much younger yeah if you could say if you can recall laughter anything that you can remember  so those things   how how that was or how you spent your days what you did all i remember when we were kids when we were 'cause we started out actually in in nineteen sixty-three was his political caree career started out when he was appointed i think it was in nineteen sixty-two when he was appointed as secretary of justice by whom by president macapagal but before that he was just a lawyer 'no an ordinary lawyer and what i remember of about him was just that he was at work and he would always be home at night and weekends is what i remember is that we 'll always be together every sunday we would have to go to mass and then after mass we would go sometimes we would eat lunch or out sometimes we 'd be at home and after lunch or on he would take pictures that was his hobby  taking pictures   uh we we used to live there in the boulevard so we would walk across along the bay and then we would take a pose for him laughter  he 'd take pictures that that was the normal routine that much i remember but i no i guess you 'll have to ask me more more questions na lang or when we get to the generally it was the fact that he was around when we wanted him he was more like uh he was i would say he was really a family man 'cause he was always with us uh-huh but i don't know uhm how politically involved he was then i was much too young because actually he was appointed secretary of justice i was only about ten years old  uhm  so i wouldn't really know   you wouldn't be able to remember  no i wouldn't remember much except 'no the usual kid stuff yeah but i do remember the sundays that we would spend uh taking pictures walking in the boulevard and there used to be bancas along the boulevard  and now not anymore   back then laughter  back then and sometimes we would ask the fisherman who owned the boat if we could use the banca to take pictures of us inside the banca or whatever we would not be on the water just along the along the bay because it was quite okay to walk through there walking around there like that that much i remember about those sundays  uh  so he was really more a homebody stay at home yeah we didn't have   and his office was here ano here no no at that time when we were growing uh his office only moved to the house after martial law uh because before martial law his office was in m h del pilar the building of lola long  there was a building there that i think daddy used  uh i see  i don't know what how how it came about that daddy had his office there that office has about three or four floors with the lawyers and when martial law came and dad was picked up uhm well of course the office had to be closed because daddy really didn't know how long he was gonna be inside   yes  so then we moved all the books all his books uh to the house then the office was moved to the house 3 words of the building na rin   uh uhm  uh uhm from that time on that was the time when the office   you used to  before that his office i remember going to regina building that much i remember near the church his office is along escolta regina building that much i remember and we would go there and pick him up that time from the office   oh really yeah  we 'd go there pick him up then he 'd take us out sometimes we 'd go to the movies at night along escolta you know that 's really weird that much i remember about him uh-huh but what particular hobbies did he have you know things photography for one you mentioned photography for one definitely because sometimes he would he would call us to help him in the dark room he had a dark room in the house   uh how nice and he would make us go in just to mix the chemicals for him or help him he never really made us do all the hard stuff just to be just to be there he 'd ask you okay you mix this for me you watch this you know things like that but that 's what he would do photography is really the thing that i remember he loved to fiddle with his cameras he was so excited every time he 'd go find a new lens or a new what he 's excited also when he 's printing his own pictures you know the ones that he would take that i remember  uhm  what about reading writing  reading  do you have any literary things he did or was it mostly essays  that  well no they don't 1 word it also when he was inside uh i heard he wrote he wrote you poems 'no   yeah  i remember because i told you he would write us letters 'cause when he was under detention that was the time when we well we we had to 1 word  first we were allowed to visit him every day then the military said no it had to be mga once a week lang or twice a week in othe they would use it as psych psycho war you know like just to break you or to make you feel as a like it was some kind of mental torture because suddenly you go there for a visit and then they would say no visits allowed today you 're there already all set to fix his meal uh uhm and then you 'd bring food because that was what we would always do bring food and whatever and then they would say no and and no reason they wouldn't give you any reason why you couldn't visit come back tomorrow or come back and when you come back the next day and there would still be no visits things like that so what dad would do was he would write us letters uhm especially on dates like your birthday christmas uh or if if there was some kind of problems we were having that time that mom would tell him about then he 'd write a letter  uh uhm  i remember graduation from college he wrote me a letter but this this would be censored because the military would pass would pass through them  really  the only time i remember that that they really cut up i think we still have it somewhere the military cut up some words you know lit literally censoring it 'no the letter was during that time i think it was before or after he was in solitary now how long how long was that well that was the time they went to they moved them to nueva ecija for one month   so they did change they did change location   they moved them for about one month and then we couldn't visit for about that during that time and they wouldn't tell us where daddy was did they did they change him in any way did they do you you recall any specific change in his personality after his detention or even during his detention when you would go visit him   how was he   uhm  was he the same same i think uh if anything i think it made him a more human person uh uhm because uhm i think that was when his his thoughts on human rights began to crystallize uh uhm  word when that 's when he that 's why when he got out when he was he when he was released that was the time that he started uh all of his human rights work and going around the country and talking and defending these people that was when it really started but he was always the type who was looking for the family for support and since we knew that he had done nothing illegal to deserve being put in jail except he was just a very vocal critic of marcos at that time then we were not afraid well of no i don't think we were afraid and we were supportive of him and there were people who would come to us and say oh just tell him to do what marcos wants and you know everything but why he has not done anything wrong so dad has always been a very principled person so this is he was the one who taught us all he word  if there 's anything wrong since you haven't done anything wrong and you believe that what you 're doing is correct why should you you know just do what you want just to do just to do what somebody else wants so that was what he lived by actually the last i think the last uh let 's say the last uh twenty years i think because he died in eighty-seven 'no and he was imprisoned in seventy-two so he was released in seventy-four so mga the last thirteen to fifteen years of his life was really devoted to human rights ever since prison because in fact what happened was in prison he could do everything what he couldn't do before that because he was a senator you know he had to do a lot of things like the senate work  uh uhm  yeah and then he had his law office and then you know speaking engagements and all that stuff so then then he could read he read a lot then he could write he could think it was like you know when you 're a very busy person and suddenly you 're given a time to do what you always say oh yeah if i had the time i could do it so i think that 's the time that he had okay words  i think although of course what was often a strain on him was being away physically uh uhm  3 words  we never needed him so much it 's only i guess when we we on our part maybe we also we also suffered from the separation although we didn't we don't really think about it actually after martial law not af after martial law after dad was released when people would ask me about it i would always say like it 's just a part of my life really
