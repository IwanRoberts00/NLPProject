and i graduated mass com my dad asked me to work with him rather than to work for the government  because if you 're in broadcasting you work with the government you have no choice so i said sure for a while and i ended up working with him for something like fourteen years before he died  uhm  uh uhm uh so but i was also i was doing a lot of crazy things like i was teaching in u s t i was teaching in assumption i was not a very good teacher speaker a chuckles  i have no patience uh and i used to dub you know those japanese cartoons as in voltes five  uhm   oo  okay but i was not in voltes five

i was teaching in assumption no u s t i think break in the recording in assumption something like eighteen or twenty-one units and then i was uh dubbing and then i was working for my dad all at the same time  uh uhm  all at the same time this lasted for about a year and then after that i went full-time already with my dad so i used actually uhm i 'm now connected with flag at that time i was helping him out with flag uh but let me see i started out with my dad as the receptionist and then the clerk typist librarian uh bookkeeper accountant i went around 'till i became his secretary and then eventually i managed his firm uhm so i started from the bottom up yeah there break in recording; presumably she was asked what number she was in the family  number six number six yeah uh here uh number six okay i have a son i am not married uhm uh my son is now eleven years old he is uhm the one who looks i think the most like my dad and he was the favorite of my dad break in the recording  to think he was the only one who was who can  uh uhm  he 's the only one maya who says that she was the baby until her nephew came along that 's him this is the one yeah because she used to be the favorite until my son came along when my son came along there was no more favorite except my son he was the one who would accompany my dad everywhere he had a desk in my dad 's office which you know kind of wasn't allowed uh but he was the only one he would he he and dad were very close they were talagang unclear utterance by speaker a  now he is eleven so when your dad died he was only he wa dad died in eighty-seven uh uhm february and my son 's birthday is also february okay uh so ano he he took he really took it very badly because he viewed my father i would say uhm not so much as a lolo i mean both as a lolo because he was spoiled rotten really laughter  uh but also he but my dad was his father image that was his concept so when my dad died he he he he his studies were you know he just didn't wanna study anymore he he he was really of al i think 'no  uhm let me put it this way i could not grieve as much because i had to look after him because he was the one who really really really i mean  yeah  he took it badly he he really did he he took it badly word  he couldn't sleep he wouldn't eat you know that type  siya talaga 'yung naapektuhan so i was affected but i couldn't break in the recording because i had to attend to my son  yeah  well anyway so you remember your dad before he was into politics  do you remember that time   as a kid i used to work for him all the time you see my dad was more my boss he and i had a very good relationship but i would say that i knew him very well as a boss uhm because i worked for him  uhm  so what was his personality what what kind of a person   he was a perfectionist okay i yet i heard he always did things last minute yeah but he was a perfectionist in this sense ha   uh yeah  there 's a pleading uh he he does not like touch and go office supply used for erasing  at that time there were no computers so i could not submit anything to him that had an erasure because he didn't like it he was he was that much he was also what he demanded of himself he demanded of us uh so he demanded he had very very high standards in everything he did he felt that if you do something you do it well or you don't do it at all period and that was what he imposed on himself that 's what he imposed on us he also was uh i don't know a very responsible person uh in this sense 'no like for example we the staff i mean i would make him laugh with booboos but in front of the client he would protect us he he would you know but in front of when it was us he would bawl us out why did you do that you were so stupid ta tah ta tah ta tah i mean he had no compunctions about that uh what kind of a person was he he was also ano he loved books and huh he used to say ale mahal instead of ali mall that will that was our joke all the time okay he would go around with us break in the recording  several times i used to accompany him to his hearings he would forget that i was with him speaker a chuckles  he would leave me and it 's up to me to go home i don't even know where i am and it 's up to me to go home because he had so many things in his head  ah yeah ha   uhm  uh he 's always thinking so he yeah i thought yeah he was thinking uhm and sigh and then uhm no okay he loved crossword puzzles he he would do that a lot of times uh what else would we do  ano rin siya he was very uhm cari&ntilde;oso  uhm uh he would always make akbay he would always put his arm around you he was not uh he was not ano i mean at least with us 'no with us kids very cari&ntilde;oso  and then uhm i don't think he had much of a sense of humor but we would laugh all the time and he wouldn't find it funny i mean okay there were things he wouldn't find funny of course 'no  i mean uh but not my sense of humor he was more serious than most uh he what was his wha what else was he like you know basta he was a tough boss he he would he was a difficult person for me 'no  he was very challenging to work with but he was and the thing about okay there are a lot of things i like he accepted a lot of criticism for someone 'no who who writes as well and as intelligent as him for example he had a talk he would prepare his talk he would show it to me announcing you read it you read it tell me what you think he hated an answer like it 's okay it 's okay i he hated that uh he encouraged you to argue he encouraged you to criticize even him and his works and i remember doing that and he i remember telling him papa no i don't think it should be done this way uh i don't think this is correct i don't agree with you you know etcetera etcetera and he said and he argued with me and we really argued and then in the end he says okay and he changed it and then i   he was really open to very open and he also for his for a man of his stature his brains he was very intelligent he was also quite humble about himself in that sense because very few people will take their work their masterpiece being criticized he loved it he would show me all his papers what do you think what do you think about this uh he he always like for example for me i 've i was never a lawyer he trained uh with his father right  uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm   as a lawyer yeah he he took up two years of law that 's all if i remember and uh his father used to teach him this trick and he would do it to everybody all of us at us who worked with him his father would tell him read this he would read it and he would go back to his father and he 'd say i 'm through and his father would say okay read something else and he asked won't you ask me questions about what i read no you said you read it i trust you i imagine you understand it if you don't understand it you ask if you don't if you understand it then fine read something else it stuck with him uhm and the other thing that his father taught him was how to research so if i asked him any question he would say you have eyes you have a brain god gave them to you go to the library look for whatever it is you 're looking for read it look for it when we were really stuck then i 'd go to him like sorry can't find it etcetera etcetera  hay then he 'd sit down and explain it and i i never studied law i worked with him but towards i would say uh the eighties already we would sit down and discuss his cases and i would ask him papa can't you do it this way and he 'd say no you see because if you do it if you handle a case in this way this is what 's gonna happen but if we do it another way it 's fine so he didn't mind he never made me or any other person feel stupid uhm you could ask a lot of questions and he would take be patient enough to answer it at the same time he encourages you uh not always to think the way he wants he does not and he already he told us me anyway so many times you can't uhm don't believe what i believe because i believe it believe what you believe because you believe it i don't expect any of you to follow me or do exactly what i 'm doing or what or what or what you do it because it 's you because it 's what you want  uhm  uhm he really made us pushed us to be very independent thinkers uh uhm and uhm responsible thinkers i don't know how else before before that so i was i 'm one of the younger ones
