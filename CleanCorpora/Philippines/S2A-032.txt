good morning everybody
""
i 'm sorry i 'm late 
""
uhm my topic is on creative therapy  and uh when they told me about this topic  i had to think really hard because uh  sometimes when you practice for a while you don't any more uh you know reflect on what you 're doing
""
it 's sort of like it comes and sometimes i think to myself that when i face a particular patient  i 'm not really the one there you see i 'm just an instrument
""
so it more or less has a lot to do with uh being open  'no 
""
you open yourself to  to the patient and whatever it is that the patient says to you
""
so uh when you when you decide to do therapy with a patient unlike when i initially started as a therapist that i was very careful about referring to specific uh theoretical models
""
what happens is i don't know which comes first
""
is it the theoretical model
""
is it the experience that i have
""
is it me
""
is it the patient or is it uh  is it enlightenment from above you know
""
so i decided to really sit down and think about think about uh what it is that that a person does
""
i think that after a certain time all of you without knowing it you become creative   'no 
""
what stimulates the creativity primarily i think is the desperation that you sense from your patient and you don't really have very much time to reflect uh on it it 's like you respond automatically  'no  to the patient
""
so uhm  i i sort of look back into my  my notes and i said to myself uh maybe the best thing for me to do is really sit down and systematically show you  uhm the various things that that goes through that that goes through the process of of uh doing therapy with a patient
""
i 'm only speaking for for myself  'no 
""
and i think i have  sort of referred this to some of my colleagues  doktora  ruiz is one of them  'no  so i i don't know if you 'll agree  'no 
""
first of all i 'd like to define what the meaning of  therapist  is  for me
""
for me a therapist is a healer  specifically a therapist is a healer of the psyche  of the soul if you want to call it or of the spirit
""
and the spirit or the soul or the psyche has been wounded uh and the wounds come from human conditions 
""
and so uh by the very nature of the psychic wound  uh the therapist must explore the realm of the unseen  'no  of the abstract of the symbolic
""
so most of the time it 's intangible and uh  that 's the reason why  uh in my work in the hospital i work with psychiatry residents and these people these medical residents have spent twelve years of their lives working with the concrete
""
in other words they work on the human body
""
so they know all about the circulatory system all about the nervous system all about the digestive and the reproductive system
""
they know that very well and then suddenly they enter the world of psychiatry  where there is where you are required to make a dramatic shift from the concrete to the abstract 
""
needless to say it becomes a very difficult task for a medical student who has always been hands on on the physical to suddenly shift  'no  and go to the abstract process
""
so i think for me working with psychiatry residents the first year is the most difficult wherein there is a shift from the concrete to the abstract
""
the concrete is now just symptomatic because you are more concerned with the abstract process or what the unseen what you don't see really  'no 
""
i don't find that as difficult when i work with uh psychology uh students they seem to automatically shift  'no  into the abstract process  or let 's say the symbolic process or what is unseen by the naked eye
""
so that that that 's those are the two things that that that uh really strike me
""
it 's by the nature of your own training 
""
also i think  no matter what a person says or no matter what people say that you can become a therapist  i also think  that you cannot force yourself to be a therapist
""
you must already have been one  maybe unfinished or there must have been that must be your gift from the beginning  'no 
""
so some of you might have known from early childhood that you could see certain things that other people cannot see i 'm not talking  psychic   'no 
""
you can see uh you can sense that somebody is hurting  whereas perhaps your brother or your sister tells you oh you it 's all in your mind
""
you know what i mean
""
you can sense it
""
you can pick up sadness  'no 
""
you can pick up conflict
""
but you don't have those terms but you already have that gift
""
so coming into a more professional training what they try to do or what the institutions try to do is they just try to give you uh  systematic ways of figuring out how it is that you are sensing this  'no 
""
and sometimes i don't know if that 's good or bad
""
when you take a p h d as i 'm telling my class you end up pressured harassed and depressed  laughter  okay
""
so in other words you 're so pressured  kasi  to memorize all of these various theories
""
and you 're so harassed because you have these fifty thousand papers okay
""
and you 're so depressed because you 're not giving yourself enough time to reflect on what you 're doing and if you are a therapist you are a natural reflector  'no 
""
so sometimes you just want to sit down and say to yourself wait a minute what 's happening to me
""
and for me that is what a therapist is all about for as long as you 're working with someone else
""
it 's not only that someone else that you 're dealing with you 're also dealing with your own 
""
how am i reacting to this
""
am i interpreting this person 's issues because of my own issues or what  'no 
""
so there 's a constant interplay between you and your client
""
so you might have a person who is fantastically trained  in psychoanalysis  but that person is not anything for the client because that  per  that analyst never interacted never gave of himself  'no 
""
so more than that creative therapy i think is the ability to be able to touch the other person in a healing way  and at the same time allowing that person to touch you and to make you grow
""
needless to say i think what happens is  clears throat  somewhere along the way most therapists get burned out   'no 
""
i think anybody who 's in a helping profession gets burned out
""
why
""
because i think our tendency is always to look to the needs of others and forget our own needs 
""
so hopefully creative therapy will be a way  of  getting your psychic perks  'no  by in your interaction with your patient as well as providing your patient uh with psychic perks  'no 
""
so by the very nature of the wounds that your specific client has in other words we get a lot of those kinds of people in the hospital they come in and they have a thorough check up and they have all sorts of doctors looking at them and then the doctors will say there 's nothing wrong with you you can go home
""
and the clients and the patient says no i don't feel well  and then the doctor will come out and show all the results you see your blood is okay your x-ray is okay there 's nothing wrong with you
""
get out of that bed because we need it for somebody who 's really sick okay
""
but they don't know that this person is really sick
""
it is what you would call perhaps in the bible  sick in the spirit  or what you would call  experiencing the dark night of the soul 
""
and it is what perhaps what uhm what you would say not in the presence of if you are spiritual not in the presence of god 's grace or someone who has shut himself completely from any kind of uh  interaction
""
in other words that person has become stagnant inside  'no 
""
so how do you say that how do you put that in a chart
""
dear dr so-and-so thank you for your kind referral
""
my diagnostic impression of this patient is that he is experiencing the dark night of the soul  laughter 
""
okay now what would happen to you is they would confine you in the psychiatric unit beside the patient that they referred to you
""
so you don't say that although at the back of your mind you know you just know
""
why
""
because this person perhaps is manifesting certain kinds of behavior which even as a child you could already sense 
""
i don't think there 's any one person in this room  who has not had  that kind of  call it what you will intuition sensing or whatever
 even as a child they could feel the other person 's pain 
""
so  by the very nature of the wounds the therapist must consider several things
""
you have to have you can say oh i can feel you are in pain  nobody gives very much value to your feelings
""
so what they have tried to do i think uh as you go into higher education is they try to sort out manifestations of this pain
""
and so what is the main manifestation of of this particular pain in your patient or this particular conflict 
""
that is what you are studying now
""
that is what you would call the behavioral symptoms
""
so we are very attuned to behavioral symptoms
""
uh examples of behavioral symptoms would probably be constant ticks you know like that or uhm  signs of uh restlessness or disorientation forgetfulness okay use of language
""
how do they use their language
""
do they do they speak in uh  a a gentle tone or do the words come out  very rough  'no 
""
so these are symptoms
""
and other behavioral symptoms probably would be if you go a little further a person can no longer use his right hand  although neurologically and muscularly he can he 's supposed to  okay but he can't use it anymore
""
uhm  aches and pains that have no pattern  'no 
""
so a person has an ache here an ache here okay notice usually if there 's an ache it 's all on one side that 's supposed to be the pattern
""
but you have people who have aches and pains all over their body and if you suggest you have a pain here yes doctor there too  laughter 
""
okay so in other words whatever you suggest there 's pain
""
so you are able to pinpoint that sort of thing
""
also you have to pay behavioral symptoms pain symptoms language symptoms voice tone okay
""
you know that very well in neurolinguistic programming  'no 
""
is the person auditory visual kinesthetic
""
those things you take into consideration too  okay
""
what are all these symptoms uh 
 for  for the therapist these symptoms are nothing more but the expression of the patient 's conflicts anguish frustrations and anxieties okay which john of the cross summed up as  the dark night of the soul  okay
""
take for example a man  who all his life has always done the right thing upright 
""
i just had this kind of patient a couple of months ago
""
he has always done the right thing
""
he has always abided by the rules
""
he has always been the ideal husband and father 
""
then one day his wife 's mother died and so she had to go back to the province and she brought her children with her but he could not go because he had to work in manila
""
the man is forty-three years old  okay
""
two months later when his wife came back  he sat down and he told his wife i no longer love you and i don't want to live with you anymore
""
i want you and the children to pack up your bags and go back to the province
""
and so the wife said what did i do
""
i mean you know was i a bad wife
""
no you were not a bad wife 
""
then what is it
""
i just don't feel for you anymore 
""
and so the children of course reacted and what did they say what kind of a father are you
""
you 're not the person we know
""
our mother is so good
""
and so it became a family problem
""
but actually what was the problem was this man 
""
suddenly he had to confront aspects of his life which he thought he had overcome many many years ago by being very strict with himself  okay
""
so the wife said there must be another woman
""
and then he said no there 's no other woman
""
then there must be another man  laughter  okay
""
then he says he says no there 's no other man
""
so i i came across this man not because he was my patient the children the children were my patients because the wife was saying that the children were acting up
""
so they would manipulate ways and means of getting him to come
""
so finally when he came he said he just doesn't feel anything for anyone
""
he just wants to quit everything
""
he wants to quit his job
""
he wants to quit his family
""
he wants to quit everything okay
""
but the wife is such a formidable person that she said i am not going to quit  i am not going to give you up without a fight
""
and the husband said you can fight with your own shadow because i am not going to be there
""
