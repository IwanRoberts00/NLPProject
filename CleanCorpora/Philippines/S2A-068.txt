mr president distinguished colleagues  coughs  permit me to
read a letter dated may 12 addressed to me
""
dear senator guingona
""
in the wake of the senate debates concerning the visiting forces
agreement i recall that the lead department during its negotiation was the
department of foreign affairs
""
the department of national defense and the d o j lent support in
relation to their respective areas
""
i was a member of the ad hoc team of prosecutors and lawyers that
assisted you then in the study of the d o j position
""
from the inception of the discussion on the proposed v f a you were
resolute in finding an agreement that was just and equitable
""
for this reason you stressed to your d o j team and the cabinet and
at cabinet meetings the importance of resolving the recipre reciprocity issue
if the conclusion of the v f a was to be feasible meaning as a precondition
thereto
""
the united states should agree to implement a counterpart
reciprocal agreement in favor of the philippines
""
i did not have the chance to be a part of the team that negotiated
with the united states as i was appointed to the judiciary
""
the agreement was concluded much later when i which i heard
occurred in february nineteen ninety-eight when you and i had already left
the department of justice
""
i take this occasion to extend my best wishes
""
sincerely
""
teresita leonardo de castro
""
justice of the  sandiganbayan 
""
mr president may i request that this letter the original be uh
inserted along with my speech
""
permit me also to reiterate the statement of my friend secretary
siazon pursuant to uhrm the testimony during the public hearings on january
twenty-six nineteen ninety-nine and i quote your honor just to put the uh
issue in correct perse historical perspective the reason why we have a v f a
two is when we were negotiating or before we started negotiation negotiating
on v f a one because of the advice of the then secretary justice guingona
whose advice i respected and shared that we should have some similar
treatment for our boys and their families when they go to the united states
""
i made this as a condition to the americans
""
we would now start negotiating on v f a one but later to negotiate
on a similar or for some similar treatment v f a two close quote
""
permit me also mr president to read into the records the letter of
president ramos dated february uh may fourteen nineteen ninety-nine
""
dear senator guingona
""
tito in the midst of the ongoing debate on the visiting forces
agreement let me say that even during the negotiations for the same you
already held strong reservations because in your view you wanted a fair and
just agreement between the two nations
""
having recommended the scrapping of  balikatan 
exercises because you believed that no firm legal basis existed therefore
""
regarding the v f a you stood on full reciprocity as a condition
and the submission of the same to the senate for concurrence in accordance
with the constitution
""
i respect you for your convictions although your position on the v
f a may differ from mine
""
nevertheless i continue to hope that you will see the v f a in a
better light
""
with best wishes
""
fidel valdes ramos
""
may i ask mr president that this the original of this letter be
attached and uh be an integral part of my speech 
""
these documents mr president show my stand on the v f a even during
the period of negotiation
""
we stood for a just and fair agreement we stood for reciprocity we
stood for submission of the same to the senate for concurrence
""
but the outcome of the negotiations did not result in a just
agreement did not entail any reciprocity did not end up in a fair agreement
""
there was v f a two but no reciprocity
""
there was submission to the senate but none to the u s senate
""
i therefore stand more vigorously opposed to this visiting forces
agreement today
""
i vote  no  for historical reasons
""
a century ago emilio aguinaldo relied on the promise of united
states consul in hong kong to help gain filipino freedom
""
he virtually invited the first visiting forces of the united states
to come to the philippines
""
admiral dewey came
""
and look where it got us
""
we had to fight a war that until now the united states refers to in
a cavalier manner as a petty insurgency versus her manifest destiny
""
america gave us many good things
""
she gave us education she taught us the lessons of washington and
lincoln and jefferson and gave us back our independence in the wake of war in
nineteen forty-six
""
but she also imposed upon us foreign military bases
""
she imposed upon us the parity amendments she imposed upon us the
one-sided special economic relation that tied and dominated our economy and
military bases for almost fifty years until nineteen ninety-one when we said
 no  to the base agreement
""
today i cannot but say  no  again to a visiting
forces agreement that may repeat the sad lessons of history
""
i vote  no  because this agreement violates the
equality of persons and nations
""
the activities mentioned in the agreement articles three four five
six seven and eight make the united states personnel a special class of
persons treated much better than the filipinos in their own land no
reciprocity no equality of national and personal rights and therefore i vote
 no 
""
i vote  no  because this agreement was submitted
under a wrong provision article seven section twenty-one of the constitution
""
the framers of the nineteen eighty-seven constitution intended to
correct a wrong when the united states imposed military bases upon us
""
they virtually mandated the philippine senate to ratify not to
ratify without submitting the same to the united states senate
""
so article eighteen section twenty-five of the constitution
prohibits the presence of foreign military bases troops or facilities unless
an agreement is ratified by the philippine senate and equally recognized as a
treaty of the united states in accordance with her constitution
""
this was the intent this was the prohibition this was the remedy to
correct a slur  poised  upon us by the bases treaty
""
why should our senate concur and not the united states senate
""
why should we refrain from following the mandate of our
constitution and make the v f a part of the law of the land while the united
states considers the same as a mere executive agreement
""
why do we not rectify the wrongs of yesterday by reciprocity
""
there is reference that during our time we issued opinions that
temporary visits were not covered by treaties and international agreements
""
these opinions were merely routinary opinions responding to queries
by the department of national defense or the department of foreign affairs on
specific subjects and following precedents we did issue such opinions but
certainly not on an agreement such as the visiting forces agreement because
this would entail a temporary permanent permanent temporary agreement that
was not envisioned in any of those opinions
""
mr president i vote  no  because the v f a is
imprecise uncertain unclear
""
the agreement speaks of activities but there are no clear
definitions of what the activities are
""
do they include deployment of united states forces entries exits of
aircrafts repair and maintenance of facilities access arrangements commercial
contracts construction of rails and runways rest and recreation
establishments of relay stations telecommunications
""
no clear answers no clear definition no limits no certainties
""
it can only lead to disastrous implementation if approved and the
agreement does not spell out how many troops may come who where they may
visit when
""
it does not say how long military exercises may take
""
when we accept the visitor we usually welcome him into the
receiving room
""
but under this agreement the visiting forces may enter the living
rooms they may go into the kitchen they may go into the dens and enter every
nook and corner of this land and therefore i vote  no 
""
i vote  no  because of the uncertainties of the
approving authorities
""
the agreement itself says that the activities must have the
approval of the philippines of the philippine government but the same is
negated by the fact that there exists a mutual defense board pursuant to the
mutual defense treaty that would recommend the activities to carry out
security and defense arrangements
""
the framework of the m d t includes activities that carry out
effectively the objectives of the security and defense agreements to improve
and enhance common defense
""
therefore while the proponents of the v f a contend that the
activities will be approved by our government in truth and in fact such
claims may yield to the realities of the  mu  mutual defense board
where military activities are to be recommended for decision by the united
states and  philipp  philippine military men for decisions will
ultimately be forged by our secretary of foreign affairs and the united
states secretary of state
""
decisions mr president affecting the destiny of this nation in the
hands of a body infused with foreign counterparts
""
can the filipinos in that body say  no  when the
united states representatives demand can they resist the clout military
political economic that dominates such relations can the proposed oversight
committee prevent undue acquiescence
""
i vote  no  mr president because the v f a may
not attain the objectives that the sponsors tell us is necessary because it
will give life to the m d t it will help modernize our armed forces it will
train us with the latest technology all to ensure the safety and security of
the nation and the region against inter external attack
""
perhaps
""
but the creeping invasion referred to lies in the spratlys and the
united states herself does not recognize the political sovereignty of the
philippines over the kalayaans and they have time and again claimed
neutrality over the spratly dispute not only between us and china but also
amongst the five nations claiming the same
""
the m d t itself limits the united states response to
constitutional processes after an unarmed attack on metropolitan philippines
under any vessel in pap  stutters  in the pacific and the spratlys lie
outside metropolitan philippines and the pacific
""
this was done in nineteen fifty-one when the united states nor the
philippines dreamed of the spratlys talked about the spratlys
""
it was a time when japan gave up any sovereign claims over the
spratlys
""
and so therefore all of these considerations together with the
global consideration of the huge market of china etcetera make the claim that
the united states would go to war for us over the spratlys seem unlikely
""
modernize the armed forces
""
train us
""
teach us the latest technology
""
again perhaps
""
but we had joint military exercises with the united states forces
even before and after the world war second
""
we held exercises with them when the bases were here since nineteen
forty-seven to nineteen ninety-two
""
we held  balikatan  exercises with them even after
the bases were gone
""
we leave it to the people 's judgment whether or not our armed
forces have become modernized because of those exercises whether or not we
learned of the latest technologies because even the guns and the tanks and
the planes furnished us like the huey helicopters are admittedly hand-me-down
equipments destined to limit our progress and keep us attuned to mendicancy
""
mr president we can modernize within our means
""
there are lease purchase arrangements from other countries like
israel france russia
""
israel built an army from the ground up
""
many other nations started from poverty and rose because of
self-reliance
""
we can have a corps of highly trained professional soldiers
""
let us not be blinded by the fact that just because we are poor we
cannot have an efficient armed forces
""
we do not need quantity as much as quality good pilots seasoned
seamen trained troops on the ground because as the great dramatist said
 the fault dear brutus is not in the stars but in ourselves that we
are underlings 
""
let us cast aside this mendicant attitude that we need crutches all
the time
""
let us cast aside the perception and the belief that we do not have
confidence in ourselves
""
let us cast aside always leaning to mother america
""
we need self-reliance not a gilded cage
""
we need faith not blind adherence to a foreign power that dominated
our national life since the turn of the century
""
the united states desires presence in our land because her global
strategy is patterned after global presence
""
less bases but more v f a and status of forces agreements
""
less expense but more widespread involvement and her line of
containment in our region seems to lie between japan south korea to taiwan
""
we are excluded as a reserve pawn
""
but if china and jap and uh taiwan reunite the line of containment
may bring us to the fore and we may repeat the perils of nineteen forty-one
and the grim lessons of bataan and corregidor all over again
""
the united states mr president acts for her own interest
""
let us act for our own interest
""
tne united states desires presence in the philippines because she
desires to ensure free passage of the sea lanes in south china
""
this coincides with our national interest but the united states
desires presence as well because of economic interests in the spratlys for
gas and oil and other mineral marine resources which may conflict with our
own national interests because the united states herself does not officially
recognize our political sovereignty there
""
let us then act for our own not rely on a big brother whose main
concern is his own self-interest
""
let us go the diplomatic way
""
let us have our own strategy
""
let us go to the international court and the law of the sea if
necessary
""
let us formulate our own and relearn the lessons of history
""
i vote  no  mr president because of the
grievous harm the deaths the deformations the illnesses due to the infusion
of toxic wastes which contaminated our land and seas in the past due to the
presence of military bases
