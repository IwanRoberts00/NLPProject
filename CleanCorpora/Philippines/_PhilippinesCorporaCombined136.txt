i can't imagine them together laughter  it 's very odd it 's very odd it 's like it 's like mary poppins and i don't know gene simmons of kiss getting together uh mary poppins and marilyn manson laughter  yeah okay uh there 's this segment says dondon called asaran at tuksuhan containing light protest literature on the newly on the newly ousted newly ousted erap uh not yet i e not yet ousted president at w w w dot erap resign dot x r s dot net okay there 's lots of sites and uhm it 's good to see the potential of the internet for really free speech danger being some are too free that they make stuff up that 's true and also uhm the neo-nazis become entitled to the same protection right that we give to free free speech okay john travolta is doing battlefield earth two  uh uh yeah screams  you 're kidding right coming back for more uh uh yeah screams a huge flop generally dumped on by critics who call it the worst movie of the year causing me to be curious to watch it but uhm where is he going to get funds for this unless the scientologists give it to him maybe maybe they 're going to foot the bill uh uhm okay uh someone 's wondering how we find jeaneane garofalo uh hosting letterman  did she host letterman  i think when he was uh in a hospital i didn't see it i never saw it either i don't know i think she 'd be good yeah my favorite talk show host is john stuart uhm the daily show and uhm during the american presidential campaign the daily show really had some of the best political commentary you can go to their website uhm comedy central slash daily show i think or just look for the daily show and uhm they also have snippets about various strange world events and of course they had the philippines in there oh always because uh you know whenever you say strange the philippines comes to mind our middle name uh jordan is wondering if it 's true that julia roberts was in a sequence in interview with the vampire i don't i don't think so was she like an extra or something i doubt it i don't remember i 've seen the movie but i can't remember i 'm usually good at spotting these things yeah of course she she did go on to work with the director neil jordan they did michael collins right yeah no i can't remember if that 's true or not and what is the movie of julia and brad pitt uh being shot in mexico oh i 've heard about that i don't know who 's directing it though i heard about it but uhm i don't remember uh vicky 's asking us to recommend a film from mike nichols  the graduate  of course uh uh mike nichols i want to see that annette bening gary shandling movie the one about uhm gary shandling being an earth uh uh an alien coming down to earth what planet are you from is that it  oh yeah i think that 's the title uh that 's a mike nichols' movie i haven't seen it i haven't seen that yeah  heartburn you watched heartburn  that 's a mike nichols' movie excellent i was watching again american beauty just last night and you know i have to add i didn't pay attention to the role of annette bening but she really is good in that yeah uhm 'cause initially para bang god this is an annoying character yeah and she 's so shrill and on second viewing you realize hey okay uh more directors any news about roman polanski uhm oh i just saw the e news uh was it it wasn't mysteries and scandals  it was e news true hollywood stories which raked up his uhm statutory rape conviction in the states and so he fled to france right yeah i don't know if he has already set foot in the states if they have cut some kind of deal but he can't go back to the states 'cause they 'll imprison him yeah 'cause he has a standing conviction for statutory rape isn't there a statute of limitations on this i don't know but i think that since uhm in the years after that conviction he has behaved pretty well uhm they could probably cut a deal some kind of deal but uh let 's see i saw his last movie the ninth gate  boy was it bad but it was kind of a fun bad movie because there are bad movies that are just uh bad you know a complete waste of time but some movies are so bad they actually border on good 'cause they get to be fun and uhm i saw the ninth gate that was okay and i think the last really good movie roman polanski did was tess and that was shortly after he fled to europe nastassia kinski yeah   yes  and you know uhm so he was he was found guilty of having sex with a minor and immediately almost immediately after that he takes up with the teenage nastassia kinski laughter  who 's now married to quincy jones are they still are they still i 'm not sure i don't know   uhm quincy jones uh always marrying them white women  uh uh before nastassia kinski was peggy lipton i think from the mod squad uh uh  yeah from the mod squad   the mod squad that 's that 's a show i i yeah and and that 's a movie that flopped big time laughter  yeah uh the black guy there uh that played link  what 's his name clarence williams the third yeah i didn't make any connection i saw the general 's daughter and i didn't realize it was him yeah it 's him uh playing the aide of uh james cromwell  oh my god   uh uh  you know what i 'm told it 's a brilliant brilliant movie that you can catch on cable babe pig in the city  everybody tells me it 's a brilliant movie but i saw two minutes and it was just so intense and traumatic i said i think i 'll watch it when i catch it from the beginning 'cause uhm terrible things happen to these animals chuckle terrible things so 'no i think you should watch out for babe pig in the city  uhm okay i was watching this afternoon just just around twelve uh a movie with let me see aidan quinn uh ben kingsley donald sutherland   oh the assignment  that 's the assignment   yes i didn't get the title   that 's where uhm what 's his name aidan quinn looks exactly like carlos the jackal and so they hatch a plot to catch the jackal uh okay i 've never seen it before that caught my attention you know how they caught the real life jackal no  si carlos who is venezuelan they got him when he was sedated and awaiting liposuction laughter  uh huh vanity they got him at at the doctor 's office he was waiting for his liposuction operation boom  laughter okay uh recommendations for movies of david cronenberg uh existenz   existenz  was was dead ringers his yes dead ringers my favorite david cronenberg yeah no my favorite is scanners  oh yes i have a special fondness for that movie in which heads explode  yeah   brains fly  the first time i saw michael ironside was in that movie i love that guy yeah and di ba as as noel vicious pointed out you know david cronenberg always the decay of the human body as seen in scanners the fly dead ringers existenz  what else uhm  uhm yeah yeah   naked lunch was  naked lunch yes although well he also made m butterfly which was just embarrassing 'cause there was no way in hell that anyone would be convinced that john lone was a woman he 'd stubble speaker a laughs  okay uhm oh hold on what do you mean by an indie film an a film and a b film an indie is an independently financed movie it 's usually low budget because uhm you raise the funds yourself you don't go to a major hollywood studio a studio being some uh a production uh uh a studio like warner brothers or dreamworks or you know those things and then an a movie would be uhm i guess uh a mainstream quality type movie although jean claude van damme movies are considered a films right i don't know laughter  not necessarily and then b movies are just those think michael dudikoff yeah that 's it mr b movie uhm yeah what else i don't know and and then and there 's also these slight distinctions like david haselhoff no matter what he does will always look like a b movie actor laughter  no matter how much success he gets on t v he would always come off as b uh uh  okay yeah poor guy  uh uh at least you know at least he can laugh at his own image okay uhm uhm okay rushmore will be shown tonight on star  okay thanks for the tip watch it watch it it 's it 's wonderful one of my all time favorite movies star movies available in home  yeah we don't get that in sky

tom green one testicle mark wahlberg three nipples yeah you 're right they should get together odd numbers and forget why i 'm there yeah yes uh uh the shorter memory loss is just probably you know our old age uh i know that she said our  yes yeah that happens to me sometimes and and uhm i have no problem remembering things from twenty years ago yeah but two minutes ago is sometimes a problem snicker  or stuff that you would normally know like uh someone asks you the name of a movie you love and you can't seem to get the title in your head no matter how hard you try and you know you know
