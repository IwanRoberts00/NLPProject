uhm i think he should be a responsible man responsible enough to know uhm the needs of his family and he should prioritize his family first before his work uhm he should be concerned concerned with you with the with the relationship or  concer  uhm i think yes he should be concerned with with uhm the environment he should be environmental-friendly i mean  laughter environment laughter   because  yeah yeah yeah because i 'm not that environmental-friendly okay so i think i need someone who should teach me how you 're you 're saying like you want someone who 's not like who 's not you uh is that what you mean not really but i think i want a person who would teach me the things that i don't know and i still have to learn   know  okay and what else uhm of course i want laughter i want i want him to be physically attractive okay but if i can't get i expect i can't have it all then i 'll settle for someone who 's not that that good-looking looking yeah but his uhm his values are quite okay and uhm he 'll love me for who and what i am the way i should love him for who or what he is how about you with what you 've said earlier when you said someone who 's not that good-looking you know what for me yeah i don't   i think i want someone who 's presentable speaker a laughs you know like laughter when i go to parties or to any family gathering i can be proud of him he 's properly dressed yeah he talks really well yeah and he communicates well with other people i want someone smart smart yeah i can i can i can  talk to him no uh yeah i can talk to him any topic at all yeah and he can relate to other people uh yeah he knows what he 's saying and also i want someone who can love me more than i love him well that 's what most women speaker b giggles say okay uhm but how about education as much as possible i want him to be a college graduate or even he has a masteral degree oh my god sir our teacher is quite you know chuckle   well  well laughter uh-huh no comment anyway any yeah i want someone who 's extra cute i mean not not only that he graduated from from a particular university but i want him you know educated as in the real sense of the word yeah i think i can understand you because there are some educated people who really have the values and the character of a pig yeah yeah laughter  right yeah i also want someone who 's understanding uhm but i 'm a career woman and in the in the future i want to work i want to and not to stay at home yeah i think i think what you 're saying is that your husband or your ideal man will allow you to be yourself and to achieve what you want in life  yeah  yeah because that 's what i also think that 's what i think i want to be so what else what oh no it 's raining i know i know i know so anyway we have to continue with the conversation  anyway  uh uh again i want a guy who my family will love  there are some guys that your family they cannot they cannot they cannot   relate  yeah they cannot love him because they feel something bad or i said this to you before uhm i think one of my uh one of one of my teachers said or one of our teachers said thunder that you shouldn't thunder huh uhm laughter  marry you shouldn't marry at a at a young age at a young age yeah  kasi them a guy uhm at the age of like early twenties and mid-twenties they 're like quote unquote playful speaker a laughs   you know   uh yeah yeah i think yeah i think i remember that uhm what i have i have a friend who told me that you know i i i was shocked when i hear this because uhm he 's a guy and he told us girls that we should like you know  play around   collect and collect then select laughter   ah talaga  my god yeah i mean maybe not really play around but you know like if if you 're not rea if you 're not satisfied with this kind of relationship and with this kind of guy then get out of it of that relationship   yeah just get out of the relationship and then find another or if you 're still ready yeah right but not like two girls at the same i won't take it anymore  my god no  no of course not   i don't like those kind of guys do you think a guy can like you met this guy and you have no idea that you know he has this kind of attitude that he 's playful laughter and i want to use that word i like it  laughter i can see that laughter  you you met this guy and for for you he 's okay here 's this situation he 's he 's handsome you know at first glance he looks so ideal yeah but the attitu you there are hearsay na he 's he 's like he has this that attitude yeah are you still gonna go out with him or well or you 'll prove na people are wrong or you want to see it for yourself uhm i think i think i have to get to know the person first before i really really should judge him or in the first place i have no i have no uh i have not the right i don't have the right to judge that person because he i did i don't know him and he doesn't know me right but if ever i 'll get to know him and then maybe i can tell what kind of person he is   he is  but i don't have the right to judge him based on on what other people say i don't know if you can relate with what i 'm going to say but i like a guy who 's like my dad laughter  i think i think you know i think uhm   you can relate  yeah laughter yeah yeah yeah yeah do you agree with what i said yeah 'cause i want a guy who 's like my dad   your dad   i know   yeah  especially if you 're like attached to your dad yeah or or maybe uhm other girls or other women would like uh  words if you 're daddy 's girl what  like if you 're a daddy 's girl yeah you you like someone as your dad yeah because uhm you can see what your dad is doing what he 's doing for the family how hard he 's working and i like someone like that who can provide you with everything or like women who are who did not grow up with their fathers around laughter   okay  yeah and what else uhm my ideal man tall dark and handsome but of course really yeah but but you can't have it all so you know if someone   you go for tall dark and handsome guys yeah yeah i do okay laughter  my god i have this i have this okay let 's talk about that let 's talk about that ideal guy uhm based on his physical features yeah speaker a laughs  okay i 'll go first   you you you i like a guy who has nice eyes nice eyes yeah expressive eyes expressive eyes yeah you know  tantalizing eyes i want i want guys who who have these sleepy eyes you know tantalizing eyes you know like what what what does the what is the term for that mapungay  yeah  mapungay  i like those kinds of guy yeah and uhm charming i like uhm ano tsinito guy  tsinito  not all tsinito guys but i like  ano   tsini you know there are certain guys speaker a laughs who are who has these tsinito eyes but it 's not bagay  yeah and uh one one one more i don't like guys who smoke oh speaker a laughs i don't like guys who smoke yeah 'cause it irritates me when oh wel the smell of of cigarettes i don't like it uhm i 'm going to teach you one term what from the p m a what  scub  what 's that cigarette  scub  yeah and then does that refer to cigarette yeah from there yeah okay scub  so if you 're a smoker they 're gonna call you scubbard   yuck   and it 's really bad for the ears yeah smoker scubbard my gosh  and i don't want guys who are who have many vices yeah i mean i mean it 's okay to have occasional occasional drinks like that  occasional  but i don't want them to be a drunkard laughter  what 's that drunkard drunk drunk i guess laughter  guess okay what else  uhm i want a guy who is god god-fearing god-fearing yeah god-fearing or a person who has a godly devotion something like that both both i think both goes together yeah and also lastly i want a guy who has a sense of humor uh yeah   i don't want any dull moment when we 're together yeah laughter  there are just guys who who don't know what what to say and i want a guy who 's funny who 's funny yeah but not humorous okay  not  yeah laughter  i know the difference you know i think i know the difference  yeah  i like pero  uh okay uhm for me i think my ideal guy should be passionate  ay   you know yeah because because if he 's not passionate about something then how can he be passionate about me right passionate in the se  yeah right and and what 's the most important thing is that he should have love lots of love to give  yeah  because i mean love encompasses everything and yeah and if he 's like and he 's like not educated or if he 's not if he 's not uhm good or if he 's not any any bad any bad attitude uhm i think love is the catalyst that would make everybody change for the better right okay you 're right but for me even if such a even if a guy is educated he 's really good-looking and he he seems to be everything uh yeah a guy who doesn't love me for what and who i am is nothing  and don't you think uhm both our concepts of an ideal man is is in this one song which goes something like uhm starts singing you 've got to love me  yeah  the way i am for simply being me  let 's finish this speaker b chuckles   don't love me for what you intend the hope that i might be if you 're only using me to feed your fantasy you 're really not in love so let me go i must be free  it 's just so sad thinking that there 're only a few men left in this world who has all the qualities of an ideal man our ideal man uhm actually i don't think that all that qualities you 're looking for okay some laughter  okay okay okay yeah you know that 's true because times change people change and it 's clich&eacute; but it 's true you know like change is constant part of our lives but you know since change is a co change is a constant thing i think our concept of idealism or our concept of ideal man changes with the time or it just depends on the people you meet yeah yeah yeah yeah right and uh but sometimes since we can't have our ideal man we have to like not i 'm not going to say settle for what you have because because i think that 's really crap that 's crap that 's crap that 's uh it 's really crappy thing to say but don't you think if you 're if you 're like with this special someone uh uhm if it even if he has he does not have uh uhm the ideal qualities you you want in a guy uh uhm you just have i think you just have to recognize the qualities the best qualities that he has and you just thank thank god for it  god  yeah 'cause the mere fact that he loves you it 's something  of course of course i mean just uh just like what you said before i mean there 's good side and a bad side in everyone of us right and that i mean ideal ideal man or the the cause of ideal man really really depends on the person himself right
