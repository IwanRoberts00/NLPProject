""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
but  it 's been quite a while since we last saw him
""
""

""
""

""
""
super red lips   kissable  lips
""
""
 yeah  
""

""
""

""
""
you know sometimes i just want to stop thinking about
""
""
super silky smooth face
""
""
yeah  me too
""
you know what   i think  we shouldn't have absent ourselves    last  yeah
""
""
 i miss  
""
 last wednesday  
""
""
'cause  i guess if we were there it 's cool then we could have seen him for so many times
""
""
 sneeze  i hate my nose
""
it 's just a waste
""
""
anyway what are you putting on
""
""
crimson red crimson red
""
""
it 's not like that
""
""
how
""
""
here let me show you
""
you just have to dab  a small amount
""
""
i see
""
is there any difference
""
""
yes  can you see the difference like  your eyes are  uhm enveloped in this white spot and it just emphasizes your eyes
""
here  put some more
""
""
you know what  i i applied some last night and i think it looked great but you know  no one can see it
""
""
i think you should have applied some  last saturday
""
actually
""
""
actually i  ap  i applied some last saturday
""
""
you didn't  tol  tell me
""
  i would  have put some too 
""
""
 the  
""
""
wait
""
""
yeah i think  that 's why i think that 's why when i used the it last night there was this black spot
""
""
around the tip   so 
""
""
 and i   thought it was like dirt 
""
 which attached itself into the stick
""
""
so i thought  i maybe i used it
""
i must have put it on top of your eye shadow
""
so that 's why the colors stick up
""
it looks great
""
""
yeah
""
how much was this 
""
""
something like  uh one hundred  plus
""
  it 's 
""
""
 it 's not expensive  
""
""
yes it 's kind of cheap
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
compared to  uhm  consider in polish up  which costs three hundred pesos
""
""
yeah i think that 's a good bargain
""
""
of course  and it smells nice also
""
""
uhm  look  o  uh 
""
my gosh 
""
""
faye
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""

""
uh  how come i don't see an effect
""
""
uhm how is life different when you have a boyfriend
""
""
uhm a boyfriend
""
""
yes
""
""
well  you know that feeling you get  when you 're
""
i don't know if it 's love or what
""
but i don't think that 's  that deep  or what
""
but you know this  uhm  some kind of  strong intense feeling or excitement
""
""
what do you mean  intense feeling 
""
""
wait let me just read this  uhm 
""
marlon just paged me and is asking me to call him back
""

""
he asked me to page him now
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
 yeah  
""
  what were  what were you saying a while ago before i just read my  my message
""
""
uh  look  can you  p   elaborate on that  intense feeling 
""
""
i think you know what i 'm saying already
""
'cause  i  didn't you just told me that you already had a boyfriend i guess twice
""
""
uhm i guess i know but i  th  i think i forgot
""
""
so what did you felt
""
were you happy then   or 
""
""
 of course   i am   because  having a boyfriend is like finding your soulmate
""
""
 you see  
""
yeah and you know
""
""
your other half
""
""
they say that when you have a boyfriend you 're always you always look good 'cause there 's this uhm what do you call that  knock

""
it 's like he 's not real
""
""
you know the hopeless feeling because you don't know him and  and you see him every day and you you want to  to introduce yourself to him but you you
""
""
you just don't have the   guts 
""
""
 i   don't have the guts to do it
""
""
you know i was planning a while ago that maybe i could  the way uhm the i think the only way for me is talk to him is by you know asking him to buy some ticket from the y f c
""
""
yes
""
""
well
""
""
maybe maybe you we can do that or or approach his friends first and then   no 
""
""
 i think   his friends already knew us i think they knew that we have this sort of crush on m g
""
""
yes  what  uh and i i think you  i think it 's obvious
""
""
yeah   i think 
""
""
 that   they already noticed it
""

""
""
 because   whenever we follow them they always you know  uh look back or  take a a peek or a   glance  at us
""
""
 smirk  
""
""
yuck
""
""

""
""

""
""

""

""
""
uh
""
""
look  look what i 'm doing with them right here
""
""
  what 
""
""
 i 'm   doing that like that zigzag thing which i see in the magazine
""
""
 oo 
""
""
'cause you know it looks  you know hip 
""
""
hip
""
""
but it 's kind of hard to do 'cause you have to crisscross  someone interrupts and then a break in the recording 
""
let 's start all over again
""
so uhm  look what i did with my hair
""
""
what
""
""
look  o 
""
""
it doesn't look like a zigzag
""
""
what does it look like then
""
""
it looks like uh 
""
""
  what 
""
""
 it   doesn't look straight
""
that 's all  laughter 
""
it looks a crooked  it looks like a crooked line but it doesn't look like a zigzag
""
""
you know i 'm planning to have my hair cut    i want it much  shorter
""
""
 again  
""
""
  i mean a shorter  hair
""
""
 shorter   shorter
""
""
i don't want long hair anymore
""
""
it uh you know a shorter hair suits you more   suits you more  than a longer hair
""
""
 i i uh well  
""
i think so
""
""
because you look uhm
""
""
i look cuter
""
""
yeah  speaker a chuckles  cuter  as you put it 
""
""
well  and you know what i find shorter hair much more   you know attractive 
""
""
 elegant  
""
""
yeah elegant  'cause they look you know  innocent and all that
""
""
innocent  so you mean i look innocent
""
""
you look like  more of a  a kid    no 
""
""
 a kid   
""
yeah of course
""
""
i was just kidding
""
no i think you look great in your hair 
""
""
actually i really look like a kid
""
""
no i think you 'd look greater if you had your hair  s  relaxed or   straightened  out
""
""
 straight  
""
""
'cause you 're like  remember your picture your grad picture when you had your hair uhm blowered and all that
""
""
yes
""
""
you really looked different there
""
it 's like it 's not you
""
""

""
""
and seductive  chuckle 
""
""

""
""

""
""
seductive  that too uh-huh
""
""
so  i 'm having a bad hair day 
""

""
""
i think the only problem with your hair is it 's
""
""
it 's curly
""
""
yeah it 's too curly and wavy
""
""
and dry   it looks dry 
""
""
 why don't you   have uhm why don't you try uhm having a hot oil so you know to condition your hair and all that
""
""

""
""
i think you should try that
""
""
yes i think i 'll have a hot oil next saturday
""
""
next saturday
""
""
when you decide to cut your hair
""
""
what if i don't decide to cut my hair
""
""
then i 'll pursue  with my plan
""
""
you 'll just go on 
""
well  i don't know
""

""
""

""
i just i know i don't know i just  i just wish it was it would just go away 'cause it 's such you know it 's such it 's such it 's such a hassle
""
like remember when we were having this test in invesma  course code for mathematics of investment  and i really have to sniff and sniff all throughout the whole exam
""
and it was like very irritating and annoying it 's annoying sound in the class which is so quiet at that moment and it was kind of embarrassing for me 'cause i know that they could hear me sniffing and sniffing and all that and coughing
""
""
sniffing and barking  laughter  like a dog
""
""
i think so  but  you know i don't know i just  break in the recording 
""
""

""
""
have you tasted a phlegm before
""
""

""
""

""
why don't why didn't you just uhm spit it out like you should have run for  th  for the ladies ' room
""
""
it wouldn't get out of my throat
""
""
