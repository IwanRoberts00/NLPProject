""
but you know vic vic i love this weather
""
""
you like this weather
""
""
i like this weather
""
it 's not hot
""
and but i wish there were  there were something in the morning i could take so my my muscles would not ache so much
""
that 's old age of course  'no 
""
""
and what about i was listening to the closing remarks of a d a at  broadcasters bureau 
""
and she said happy weekend
""
it 's it 's only thursday a d a
""
""
for for some people it 's already weekend uh vic
""
""
yes it 's  laughter 
""
is it  laughter 
""
anyway folks uh environment-wise emily what attracted my attention this morning was still uh these friends of ours across the wall
""
""
the d e n r people
""
""
the d e n r people
""
""
yes
""
""
uh there is still the story about the nurses and the dentists uh appointed to take care of   of the pasig river 
""
""
 there 's only one explanation for that vic  
""
""
uh it looks like uh  the there are some people who have been feeding uh news bits
""
""
this is media frenzy now hey
""
""
to the reporters that not only are they are these supposedly uh these these appointees are supposedly not qualified i mean you know they 're dentists
""
what what are they doing for in a pasig river movement
""
""
hey dentists pull out something you know and they 're gonna pull out the debris
""
he he he  =sarcastic laughter 
""
you know
""
""
uh and uh the issue now is that all of these appointees have been uh uh given uh  ov  not i mean residences or they 've converted official cottages into residences right at the parks and wildlife bureau
""
""
really
""
""
area area just near where we are
""
""
and what is that supposed to be
""
i mean what are what is the purpose of those the   cottages 
""
""
 there   there are cottages there that are used for official functions
""
""
just official and not for uh lodging
""
""
not for residence
""
""
oh okay
""
""
uh it 's supposed to be sometimes
""
""
and how many of those
""
""
a halfway house
""
""
supposed to be
""
""
for provincial officials
""
""
uh okay
""
""
staying in manila
""
""
well it 's been it 's been functioning as a hotel also uh apparently
""
""
uh
""
""
occasionally
""
""
as overnight accommodations for for   official purposes 
""
""
 so how many people   are staying there now
""
""
uh no exact count but uh this batch appointed by the d e n r secretary uh is over twenty
""
so that 's about two dozen people
""
and uh what is what i find significant is that for two days now this has been appearing in media in print in broadcast and there has been no reaction from the office of the secretary
""
for one we know that secretary cerilles is in the netherlands oh   signing signing  a document uh on behalf of the philippine government
""
""
 no wonder no wonder  
""
oh well that explains it
""
""
but the public affairs people have no reaction either
""
""
because it was the secretary apparently who uh appointed these people so what can they say
""
""
and so they have to they have to wait for the secretary
""
""
of course
""
""
to come back
""
although some other officials are are issuing justifications that uh these these appointments are uh there 's nothing illegal about the appointments
""
they are contractual and so on and so forth
""
but i i sense that uh there is a group within the bureaucracy within the old-timers possibly who are who might be jealous because maybe the salaries are bigger or whatever
""
""
there 's only one explanation as i said
""
these people probably need jobs
""
""
we need uh a reaction from the secretary we 'll try to get that when he comes back
""
in the interest of you know good journalism we get the other side when we can
""
""
of course  music 
""
""
of course we 'd like to remind you you are tuned in to d w b r one o four point three
""
the program is   kalikasan vigilante  
""
this is vic milan with emily marcelo
""
""
friends as usual please uh beep us your suggestion comments
""
my beeper number is one five two five zero zero six eight eight
""
""
our
""
""
vic 's office is nine two zero
""
""
nine nine one five
""
""
nine nine one five
""
or the   office 
""
""
 our studio phone   is nine two zero eight nine two eight 
""
we still haven't heard from fe hidalgo
""
she 's probably very busy now with her new responsibilities at the department of education culture and sports if my recollection is correct about an item i read in the newspapers about fe hidalgo being appointed to some important position in the department which i 'm sure she deserves
""
a great lady like like fe hidalgo
""
emily i was telling you while we were playing that musical  bee is a bug 
""
uh i 've been thinking a lot about howie severino 's piece that i saw in the  probe team 
""
this feature on  muro ami  in uh palawan
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
we can discuss  muro ami  uh on another uh plane
""
but right now i 'm i 'm thinking more of uh this uh in terms of from from the journalistic point of view
""
""
as a backgrounder howie severino was interviewed by us yesterday   yesterday morning 
""
""
 yesterday morning   uh
""
""
regarding his uh
""
""
the segment that he produced for the  probe uh team  
""
and uh the way how he put it he went to northern palawan in search of  muro ami  because there were they got tips that  muro ami  a banned fishing method was still being used by certain influential businessmen in in that area
""
and uh it turns out as how he himself said  they went there pretending to be scuba diving tourists
""
and uh the question that came to my mind is is a journalist obligated to tell uh someone he is interviewing that he may be using this for a television broadcast
""
""
that 's the   american way 
""
""
 what what   do you think
""
""
that 's the american way
""
i don't think that is uh uh practiced in the philippines  because otherwise they will they will clam up you know these interviewees will uh clam up
""
""
and so
""
""
and so you have to use pretences or you have to pretend that you are somebody else when you 're not 
""
 hindi ba 
""
""
well uh
""
""
and i 'm sure as you said
""
""
you are you are sure of that in the u s
""
""
of course you have of course even if even while you are talking on the phone   and you want  to tape the conversation   you have to  tell the person the other person you 're talking with that you you 're taping the conversation
""
""
 but how about  
""
 you have to tell him  
""
hold it
""
""
i don't think that happened here
""
""
but hold it
""
i have seen television documentaries where uh the commentator himself said this was taken by hidden camera  and if it was a hidden camera it means the the subjects did not know they were being filmed
""
""
they were not allowed to but and uh of course they the subjects did not allow it i i mean the subjects did not know it at all
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
probably and possibly they were not allowed in uh to be interviewed in the first place
""
""
and so they the footage was taken   anyway  and it was aired anyway
""
""
 and they have to squeeze  
""
and they have to squeeze uh something from
""
""
and uh uhm the television station was not taken into court
""
""
uh uhm yeah that 's true
""
""
oh   anyway 
""
""
 but   i don't think that 's the the problem is i don't think that that will be used uh in a court of law
""
you must get a lawyer for this you know
""
""
 laughter  okay anyone out there with uh
""
""
  comments 
""
""
 with an  ope      with an opinion 
""
""
 who 's a lawyer  
""
""
and with uh relevant uh to what we are discussing here uhm i am interested because sometimes we go out to the field   and we do interviews and 
""
""
 so what what you 're saying is uh   howie should have identified himself
""
""
 should should 
""
is the journalist is the reporter  uh required to tell the interviewee that it is going it may be used
""
""
 siguro  come to think of it  siguro  in this case a hidden camera is uh is is good enough  kasi walang ano e walang  uh i don't think the the this uh  word  this uh
""
how do you call it these companies would want their executives to be uh interviewed on camera  kaya  howie had to resort to that
""
""
no but uh howie did not use a hidden camera
""
the the camera was not   hidden at all 
""
""
 because   he was supposed to be   a scuba-diver 
""
""
 he just  
""
he just used uh what you might call false pretenses  chuckle 
""
another musical break please boy  music 
""
actually howie severino  his topic was on  muro ami 
""
uh i
""
""
what about  muro ami  specifically this fishing part
""
""
i had i had uh  two two people asked me what really is  muro ami 
""
and i think emilia is also asking what what really is  muro ami  all about
""
""
yes what really is  muro ami  vic
""
""
uh this is the way i i i got it from way way back we were fighting the  muro ami  uh thing in in media and in all fronts until it was finally banned
""
  muro ami   is actually a japanese term
""
""
meaning
""
""
you know you know  dalagang bukid   the the species of fish
""
anyway it 's it 's coral coral reef dwellers
""
""
uhm
""
""
they come in large numbers and you 've you 've seen television footages underwater
""
""
oh yes
""
""
you you imagine a coral reef plenty of fish and at the edge of the reef you drop a long long huge net
""
but how do you get the fish to go into the net  so that they get entangled in the net
""
you drive them into the net
""
""
bodily
""
""
but in  muro ami  they use children  to drive
""
""
so they submerge children
""
""
no you see the children are actually  fly  uh swimming on on the surface of the water
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but they are holding what they call  scare lines 
""
""
scare lines
""
""
goads
""
""
uh huh
""
""
but at the end of the scare line are heavy things like steel or rocks or lead
""
and they pull   this  up and down
""
""
 and down   to scare the
""
""
so that it hits   it hits  the corals
""
""
 uh huh  
""
""
and sound is magnified many times when it 's under water
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
it reverberates
""
so you can imagine how scared this   this fish  are they they scamper in all directions but there there is no escape
""
""
  dalagang bukid   
""
because the net is there already
""
""
because this is this is a long line of children abreast
""
""
huh
""
""
moving towards the net
""
am i giving you a   good enough  a good enough picture
""
""
 oh sure   yeah clear as mud
""
""
but in the process the corals are broken and uh
""
""
but the end result is what they want    the  dalagang bukid  
""
""
 the end result   is they   get a lot of fish  okay
""
""
 they get the  dalagang bukid    yeah
""
""
uh fast track a little bit
""
sometime in the mid eighties we succeeded in having uh the the this method banned in the philippines
""
but the operators of  muro ami  and one of the names very closely associated with  muro ami  was a congressman-politican from cebu
""
""
whose name is
""
""
whose name is  amante 
""
and what made this controversial was that uh most of the  muro ami  ships were employing children as young as ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen years old
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and uh if a kid suddenly got entangled in a net because sometimes the net gets entangled and kids had to dive to untangle the net  and if they
""
""
that that gets entangled in the coral
""
""
yes and if and if the current suddenly changes in the direction of the diving kid he can get he himself can get entangled in the net
""
""
and there have been instances like this
""
""
 ay  there were plenty of deaths
""
and uh in that segment and in that segment of uh howie severino there were graves the graves of the kids were shown
""
