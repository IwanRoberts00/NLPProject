kids now engaging in pre-marital sex yuck i think kids are getting into it really early these days as in as in like how early you know of someone who did it at age ten eleven well i know uh well these are second-hand stories like people getting into it you know when they 're in high school like in their teenage thirteen fourteen so what makes them wanna go into it wanna go into it is it really just human nature or it 's pre-meditated nah i think it 's well there 's that human factor human nature thing but it 's more of the environment they 're in  ikaw uhm is it peer pressure or family  whi which background are you talking about or environment are you talking about everything you have the media you have the family   media as in like the movies sex movies yeah pornographic materials like abante o o tiktik names of tabloids  yeah the subliminal pornographic materials subliminal because they 're not so up front like uh that teeny-bopper movies you see now when they have this first kiss and all they start really young i mean during our time it was like maricel soriano dina bonnevie but they were past thirteen fourteen  uh uhm   you know  you know how i 'll compare this i 'll compare this to cellular phones kids now at a young age they get cellular phones who who give them their phone  and now  their parents their parents so who like initiate it or encourage them i can't blame their parents who encourage them to go into uh pre-marital sex well majority would still be their friends but it 's all the influence of the media i can't say parents condone it of course parents will condone it will not condone it will not will not why will they condone pre-marital sex  chuckle yeah you 're right i misunderstood you what do you mean nothing anyway so cough uh so what why do kids go into it just for the fun of it uh they wanna explore they wanna experiment driven by curiosity   or is it really the libido that 's acting up or i don't know i never had it when i was their age yeah but let 's try to look into i really think it 's the media uh i think it 's the environment 'cause when we were when we were in our teenage years we didn't have this kind yeah that 's true how old are you anyway twenty-nine that 's kinda old i 'm only twenty-five yeah right nah i 'm twenty-seven so basically we come from the same generation   same generation  yeah i agree with you but if we become parents hopefully we 'll we will be yeah and i think we will be 'cause i 'm gonna marry you in two years right can't we make that earlier uh that 's a different topic okay okay so cough if i become uh a parent i know what is right and i know what is wrong so i would really instill in my children 's in my kids' mind that sex is really not a bad thing what do you mean sex is not a bad thing sex is not a bad thing within the context of something yeah to have sex is good really good after marriage after marriage yes   yeah that 's how you should explain to your children yeah but you see it 's not naman the parents' fault yeah  i mean i can't say that  but if if the background if if the persuasive uh ability tama ba  persuasive ability of what of the parents okay if it 's good then the kids will not be will not buckle under pressure 'cause they 'll not give in they 'll not give in from peer pressure so it really comes it boils down to or it comes down to still the basic unit of the community okay you mean the family   which is the family does it mean that if a teenager engages in sex then i will directly assume that the parents are terrible then there there must be a lack of uh uh you know exp explaining guidance guidance or you know there should be uh like a one-on-one talk or a man or do you think you 're gonna have a father-to-son talk or a mother-to-daughters talk mother-to-daughter talk or mother-to-son talk and vice versa so i think   do you think you 're gonna actually talk to your own kid about sex uh i would did your dad i will did your dad talk to you about sex uh yeah he did when he saw me uh what  ano ba 'yon 'cause i can't i was like twelve years old when he looked at my uh drawer and he saw some pornographic materials inside then he said hey this is this is really not what it 's uh uh meant to be or meant for it 's not what it 's meant for what do you mean 'cause the acts shown in that material are disgusting in a way it 's not supposed to be that what made you buy them uh friends gave it to me you 're not gonna admit you bought them i don't have that kind of money uh back then back then  i don't have that kind of money to buy maybe my friends got it from their brothers or cousins or i don't know so we had that little talk and it kinda you know it kinda stuck in my mind that what that it 's sex is really with responsibility  you know i 'm so confused about pre-marital sex actually why my views are changing well before my best friends and i it it was like a no no thing until people close to us started confiding about actually doing it and it 's like how can we hate her we know her too well and she 's not that kind of person or how can we judge her when we know who she is i mean her character doesn't change just because she engaged in it  so all of a sudden when when people near you close to you start really doing it you 're forced to change your outlook and also forces you to look deep down and make you question your own values  okay  you have to question your your uh your strength also 'cause if you 're really strong inside you  will resist the temptation from your friends well yeah pre-marital sex is still a sticky issue as far as i 'm concerned sticky and sensitive  sticky that 's it e  so if the foundation is good about sex my the families of my friends are like well-respected families but you don't know what 's what goes inside the fam the the house the home maybe   uh i 've been with these people since grade school maybe inside the house they 're not   dysfunctional  yeah they 're not they 're not the ideal family  we went to the same school well anyways basta it 's just a sensitive issue and it makes me really look down deep inside what is really my stand regarding pre-marital sex so what 's your stand my stand is it 's still wrong it 's still a sin against god okay nothing can make it right okay i have this question wait nothing can make it right but having love in it will probably make it a little less wrong not right uh it 'll just lessen the guilt okay what if you 're uh in this situation uh you had a few drinks few laughs listen to music and then then you stumble into doing it how would you feel as in i 'm drunk if if at that point i 'm tipsy i 'm drunk uhm you like the guy not love you just you like him you you love him okay let 's put it that way you love him but you stumbled into doing it how would you how would you react i mean right after doing it i 'd probably cry why i didn't imagine it to be that way but the two of you i mean you love each other you know that you 're gonna end up with him who knows that for sure okay let 's let 's change the the the what 's this the scene or the situation what if you 're gonna get married tomorrow okay and suddenly the guy knocks at your door and says hey chinks it 's just like you know just a formality why don't we get down and dirty let 's do it tonight instead of tomorrow the wedding day will you do it probably not why because you 're tired i 'm tired after preparing for for the wedding wedding i 'd wanna look good  i wanna get a beauty sleep beauty rest  but you know  but you know even if you 're tired it only takes a minute to do it laughter  i wouldn't imagine my first time to take a minute speaker a laughs  i 'd wanna go through all the motions and all the preparations but if you did it the day before your wedding is it wrong  hard to answer i don't know so what 's wrong with doing it the week before a week before a year before uh two years before  i don't know but you see my point i see your point so i 've never been asked that question yeah but it makes sense 'no  it makes sense but i still think it 's not right i don't know if can we say there 's a degree in wrong-ness level of wrong-ness or probably not wrong-ness degree of guilt degree of guilt i don't know i 'm not sure   i like that degree of guilt what 's the nicest thing you imagine you 'd do to a girl i mean i 'm not talking about physical context do to a girl in terms of uh what you can do for her make her happy instead of having sex oh no not within the context of sex oh what nothing what makes a girl happy you know sex is not the only thing that can make a girl happy buy her shoes oh yeah buy her shoes that would make me very happy buy her shoes buy her jewelry when are you gonna give me my engagement ring uh it 's a surprise i wanna be surprised now that 's not anymore a surprise honestly when it 's a surprise nga e if i tell you when then it 's not a surprise anymore when will your parents know that we 're engaged as soon as i give you so they don't know that we 're engaged now no but you know the formality so what do they know now that we 're gonna get married soon uhm that i 've decided already that you 're the one i want you 're my love i feel like having mongolian barbecue tonight buffet i don't like why not i 'm in a budget that 's why no it 's my treat  it 's my turn  no  actually mongolian barbecue is not for me why not can't finish it oh you make your own bowl nah it 's okay i i i 'm really hungry i 'm hungry  di let 's eat downstairs we just missed dinner i like home-cooked food we just missed dinner  talaga  i thought we were going out tonight but we have to do this we have to talk remember after we 're done talking uh all i can think of right now is food all i can think of now is you or sex no it 's you yeah right no yeah well i had a bad day today a real bad day yeah why well for one uhm i looked at the bulletin board of the m b a program uh uhm and i did not recognize a single name in the dean 's list and i realized most of my batchmates have graduated while i am still half-way through and i shifted to a different masteral program i 'm not even sure if i 'll finish it so you feel like you were left behind yeah by your batchmates yeah but you changed uh programs right which i 'm having difficulty finishing because of all the travel schedules because of my work which brings me to any point in the philippines at any given time but your problem is a fun problem right because you 're enjoying your course your program yeah but i 'm having difficulty i 'm getting insecure whether i 'll finish it or not so you mean you you 're not enjoying your course i am enjoying my course i 'm worried i might not be able to finish it like so if if you 're i dropped my m b a didn't i if you 're enjoying it there 's no you shouldn't think that you will not finish it no my problem is not whether i enjoy it or not my problem is the time  my problem is whether term after term i 'll be able to enroll  oh  it 's just a matter of uh proper scheduling and proper planning i feel like i 'm driving my body crazy and you know the sad part is i 'm enjoying my course so much as in well i never thought english could be so difficult i 'm really enjoying it because i 'm really learning but my problem is i might not be maximizing the opportunities for learning because i don't have enough time to devote
