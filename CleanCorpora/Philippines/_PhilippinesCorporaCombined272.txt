 not beginning of speech it is this experience which gives our gathering and this particular day special meaning for today twenty-five years ago martial law was imposed on this country many would much rather forget that dark period of our nation 's history but should we ever forget we would only expose ourselves and our children and our children 's children anew to its indignity and horror  several sentences in filipino  martial law can we ever forget the megalomaniac regime which plundered our nation can we ever forget the strong-arm meddling in the conduct of business and industry the fawning of cronies and the wannabe cronies the shameless ostentation in malaca&ntilde;ang as the poor mired in misery can we ever forget the terrifying face of our own military turned against us as enemy under military rule there was no freedom of movement those who were critical of the regime were considered subversive they were arrested for preliminary investigation and released a half year later only to be kept on constant surveillance later to be arrested again the people learned to fear their own sisters brothers and friends they feared their own walls their own shadows their own whispered rejection of a regime so ignominious do we not remember trinidad herrera she protested against the inhumane demolition of squatters'  homes in the city she was arrested she was tortured she was but one of the thousands broken by cigarette burns ear-popping water treatment beating strangulation scalding mid-air suspension sexual assault and electric shock do we not remember the routine hamletting the rude zoning the murderous salvaging do we not remember ninoy aquino incarcerated and exiled for his opposition to this regime he was killed in the tarmac that now bears his name he was killed by self-absolutizing power gone paranoid desperate to preserve itself in power you prayed you acted several sentences in filipino  together we pray in our prayer in our recollection of recent history in our recollection of ominous events and confusing public statements we bishops and faithful catholics and protestants believers in god and humanity discovered our common position we were convinced that charter change at this time would be immoral it would be self-serving and benefit primarily those who desired to stay in power beyond constitutional limits it would divide the nation and distract from other pressing national concerns it would expose the constitution to total change without sufficient time for national deliberation convinced of its immorality we bonded in common purpose and common action several sentences in filipino  we are firm in our applause we are firm in our common position we reject an immoral change of charter at this time we reject any and all martial and military options to perpetuate any politician in power we say yes to clean and honest elections  yes to the supremacy of civilian authority over military power  yes to the imperative stability of constitutional order for this gladly we risked our lives for this gladly we would lay down our lives we prayed we acted in the darkness of confusing official statements and contradictory official actions we feared the president of the philippines was not with us we feared he was sadly 1 word from the spirit which bonded us at edsa and unified us in the ratification of the nineteen eighty-seven constitution we feared we have been betrayed in our trust several sentences in filipino interspersed with applause  the president has declared that there will be elections in nineteen ninety-eight applause  he has declared he is not running in nineteen ninety-eight  applause  he has directed his party mates to shelve legislative moves for a constituent assembly applause  he has acknowledged that the people prefer a constitutional convention after the nineteen ninety-eight elections applause   for your information this statement of mine was made eight times laughter because i was watching his changes of mind  laughter hooting applause  this is his last statement i hope he does not change any longer applause  he has declared he wills to do what must be done to ensure that the elections in nineteen ninety-eight be peaceful and honest come june nineteen ninety-eight he will turn over power peacefully to his elected successor  that is why the church is involved in this because if the election is not clean and we touched the basic laws of our constitution there will be animosity in our country and the bishops would not like this to happen therefore we are trying to solve the problems of the country  in the meantime as our president he will provide the leadership necessary to help this nation face the manifold problems which confront it today through our new-found unity and only through our new-found unity he will not be a lame-duck president in thanksgiving we now pray for national reconciliation if in the heat of our passionate love for our country and for our democracy words have been exchanged which have caused undue personal hurt we humbly ask the lord and each affected person including the president for forgiveness applause  we have not campaigned in hate and have not wished to demonize any person but we have acted with burning concern for our freedom convinced that the enemy of humanity the enemy of truth and right is wont to tempt mislead delude and possess fellow human beings into his ends in profound injury of our humanity it is this enemy we have renounced and shall continue to denounce in our sacred duty as pastor let us pray first for our president  i am praying for him almost every day i do not even pray for my mother laughter  let us pray for him sincerely that he as president now feel our respect our love and gratitude for all he has done well for our nation as president we pray that as he now addresses the urgent problems of our suddenly downward economy restores the confidence of our people and friends in our political stability and economic vigor tackles the challenge of the forthcoming el ni&ntilde;o leads us towards clean and honest elections and continues to address the alleviation of poverty that he experience behind him the united strength and energy of the filipino people  several sentences in filipino interspersed with applause  we pray my sisters and brothers for each other that we all be helped to exercise power as christ did the night before he died got up from table removed his garments and taking a towel wrapped it around his waist then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet that was christ 's power let us pray for humility in our service strength in our weakness endurance in our vigilance against all that might harm our country and unity in the shared task we have ahead of us as we have today been willing to risk our lives for freedom and democracy should the common good demand us to sacrifice more of our time our treasure our personal energy or even our lives to preserve the just order and serve the common good we pray and pray intensely that we not be found wanting ... your excellency vice-president gloria macapagal-arroyo mrs corazon

be your pastor fighting for freedom to the en last breath of my life up to the last drop of my blood up to the last twinge  of energy in my body applause  our strength is from the lord christ is our peace remembering edsa in the year of jubilee that is what we are asked to do here this afternoon fourteen years have gone by since the hundreds of thousands filled the streets around us how quickly time has gone by how do we remember edsa this year let us and let me reflect on the year of jubilee and draw a few lines from it into our present moment the book of leviticus has described a full jubilee year in these terms during this year of the lord 's favor all fields lie fallow  family members have the right to freedom to freedom family land to redeem family land that had been sold when the family was in dire need all debts are remitted all slaves are set free  the jubilee year calls for a redirection of priorities in favor of the poor christian churches and other bible-based groups have drawn up the agenda for this year summarized for us in the five rs return of the land and other means of production to their original or rightful owners recall of debts unjustly imposed on the poor the release of prisoners those of course who no longer pose a genuine threat to society release too of all those in contemporary sla slave-like conditions rest for the earth and conservation of the natural environment and the restoration of harmony among women and men best in their  rep respective roles rights and equal dignity as pope john paul the second has told us the overall meaning of the jubilee year was to call on the entire community to bring back the original harmony which god gave to his creation a harmony which human sinfulness human greed human blindness had damaged the jubilee year reminds us that we are merely stewards of god 's planning the one world the one single haven we share is not ours it is a gift of god 's love so during the jubilee year we must lift the burdens we have placed on the backs of the poor the oppressed the excluded the weakest and most powerf powerless members of society the jubilee year is meant to be a year of fostering hope so that everyone can share the hope of a new beginning of harmony within humanity and with all of creation a new hope that the grand design of god is still possible of fulfillment within history edsa nineteen eighty-six was in fact a jubilee experience it was a freeing of a nation long shackled by the ruinous dictatorship it was setting the downtrodden free it was giving broken ones new hope the blind new sight it was resurrection for the poor who had been abused tortured salvaged raped plundered slain it was truly good news to the poor it was god answering our prayers our pleas our cries and our tears no one who was here for the jubilation of the night of february twenty-fifth will ever forget the lord has restored our land to us as he had promised we need that experience of jubilee again edsa should not be reduced to an event in history when a people toppled a dictator it is rather a story of one entire nation winning the pursuit of peace through peaceful means edsa gave us hope unfortunately when we the so-called heroes of edsa were already in power we we sort of enjoyed the power and played blind to the abuses of the post-edsa years edsa changed the personalities in nineteen eighty-six but this corrupt system did not change when the victims of the dictatorship took on positions of power in government we started to keep quiet in the face of abuses because we were now the beneficiaries of the political favors the poor of nineteen eighty-six are still poor  natapos na kayo kami naman  it makes us and it makes me very sad to say this but humbly we accept that it is true edsa is about change but not simply a change of persons but a change within each person so that society can change we do not want remembering edsa this year to be an empty ceremony just show and speak the jubilee year reminds us that god 's plan for human society calls for us to try to construct here in our country some true anticipation of the world of freedom and justice solidarity and peace which is god 's kingdom for us at bottom that is what edsa was about that is what edsa must be about now to us all jesus addresses his mission statement to bring good news to the poor in an extraordinary way in this year of jubilee our present government was elected on the strength of that promise it would work for the poor let the resolve we bring home thus this edsa assembly this year of jubilee be that it will be a year when our priority above all else will be to bring good news to the poor the preferential option for the poor in our land must be the first of imperatives for all in this jubilee year so that this year will truly be the year of the lord 's favor this is our resolve as we gather here in edsa two thousand this is our task as we go back to work to bring the spirit of edsa to life and live once more it is a task for everyone this is what the jubilee year demands of us all god is with us let us go forward with him amen god bless you all  salamat po
