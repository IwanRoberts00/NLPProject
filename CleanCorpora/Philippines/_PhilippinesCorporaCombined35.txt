quiet i said my rosary i talked to him  oo b laughs  and then we had a very nice dinner at katre yeah was it good was it good it was good it was very very well presented  the presentation was so good but then i noticed whatever you order it looks the same it 's everything practically looks the same so that 's the one     oo uh oh   the styling the styling of the food oo oo  but the food was good  oo the styling  yes but the servings you know the servings were small were small uh so the prices are not reasonable the price is reasonable maybe that 's the reason the the   oh i almost forgot we have to pick up telly no what yeah she told me because she arrived early   directed at the driver naku carlito punta muna tayo kay telly   okay where is she now   sa bahay niya  uh alright i didn't know you know i went to my parlor to have my blow-dry and i said okay let me see what they can do to my hair the lady went to the bathroom and took a bath and so i was waiting there chatting with one of my friends  and then i said oh my gosh i 'll be late so i said give give me a little sh sh sh spraying sound; a laughs and then i ran out because i said i don't want to be late  oo oo oo oo  yeah she called she called and said that uh she 's done so she 's going  did you know she went to china december twenty-six to january two   uh huh i know that   yes a week  was that with friends or was that official  with with no no no uh with friends the guy is a chinese filipino and he teaches the nuns   the nuns  ahh yes oo  it must have been very cold 'no  very cold you sh yeah i hope did you tell her to bring the pictures no no no she should bring the pictures 'cause you can hardly i said who 's this and it 's she laughs  'cause she 's all loaded   she 's all bundled up  and then the funny thing is she has that scarf across her face like that because it was so cold  oh my god because of the wind chill and i said wow all of you all of you   where did they go in china  ay it was a beautiful trip according to her she said there were ice sculptures and the ice sculptures were huge oh i see i hope she brings the pictures because she brought the pictures and showed them to me   and i said okay oh why i would have wanted to go with her but it was very very sudden and bubut was in town  oo oo okay okay the guy remember i refused to continue with the  nuns' group the guy agreed i think to continue with the group  he he meets them three times a week  yeah   uh okay  that 's a lot of work laughs  it 's a lot of work three times a week three hours but you know the thing is it 's easier for him than for me 'cause he does the written phase so when they write he can sit down and rest i you ask telly how she felt when she was listening to me laughs she said  uhm   rest oo oo   oo nga  she was more tired than you she was definitely more tired than i because i was you know my adrenaline was pumping because here is this group of seven nice nuns and i wanted to find out how much i can do really   but it 's too much  yeah   uh hum  i thought annabelle lee would have handled the class she has  no patience   telly didn't i don't know telly said if she handles it then i will have to worry about it  and so she wanted me to handle it first  i said telly you know i tried ha i 've been a very good girl  i tried and she she almost faints siguro almost fainted laughs   ay telly let her tell you  uh huh okay   oo   oo oo   ay gosh but the thing is when when the guy showed me the written work it was so good yes it 's almost poetic the language is almost poetic   uh really ha   so it 's really just practice they need practice it 's the mouth and the ears  oo  so that means they are reading a lot i guess in china  it 's the oral phase  i think so yes yes yes and they are reading but when you talk to them they can hardly understand you you have to speak very slowly and even then they cannot understand you so you have to write go to the board i have to write every word almost every word i would say oh my gosh  oo  i said okay let 's talk about opposites  opposite opposite  then they would check their dictionaries each one had a dictionary you know computerized ahh i see laughs   oo oo  computerized dic so in their compu ano  they had laptops with them that small thing uhh i think they were equipped so that in case they have to ask questions i haven't said good-bye to them i said o telly i haven't said good-bye to them and because i want to tell the reason why i cannot continue with them is i don't know laughs i have to think of a nice reason  yeah   laughs it 's too much work uh i don't know so telly reports every day no no no three times m w f   talking to driver we will pick her up at her house carlito ha not here ha telly gruenberg you know the house okay  and then she 's traveling again  she 'll be visiting her sister and her brothers  she 's traveling and then i think  bandang june she 'll go to europe  oo   ay how nice that 's really the way to spend your sabbatical   oo i don't know how i don't know how and is she going back to la salle she won't anymore i don't know i haven't pinned her down  you know why should she not go back  oo  well if this one is so close and uh it 's less stress  but how much would they pay her here how much she doesn't need the money everybody needs the money a laughs don't tell me no she doesn't need the money she needs a quiet life we 'll ask her but uh this is too quiet for her uh it 's too quiet for her i would think so no no no and intellectual  intellectual what intellectual stimulation   ohh no excitement no no adrenaline  the challenge is not there  oo is not there because my my children were asking me o mommy how is st mary 's as compared to la salle oh there 's no comparison it 's a provincial place  it 's very cute because the children you see the children running around but it 's quiet that 's it  hmhhh oo oo  no excitement the your excitement is how to contain twelve freshman students sit don't slouch laughs  so you 're teaching you 're a you 're a finishing school yes i am because i told them you cannot be skittish like high school would they know what skittish means and i said every word that i say you should look it up in the dictionary   talks to driver uh just busina ka lang daw carlito lalabas na siya  and add it to your vocabulary and then i mentioned agog we were agog agog  break in recording   pumunta kami doon to watch the ice sculpture so we went to four places harbin and beijing and two other places  al you know all snow oh my god you had winter clothes with you yes

one was made of all ice with with lights inside  iba yon 'no that was different and then the other uh one was a competition of snow carvings snow naman yon but that was a different place uh oo oo  my

of them so china is finished u s next month and then europe will be by july uh summer summer i want to go to vietnam  they say it 's beautiful ho chi minh  hmmph   oo nga oo   benjie says benjie rebullida says i want to marry vietnam what vietnam laughs figurative language marry i want to marry vietnam figurative language  talaga ha   uy where is benjie now i don't know i hope i don't see him   is he the one with a problem you know i hope i don't meet him anymore  why   why  because i called him when the rumors were circulating i called him benjie what is this rumor i 'm hearing about you and then he says hindi ko nga ho alam ba't ginaganito nila ako e  i don't know why they 're doing this to me  you mean there 's no truth to that rumor  wala sabi niya  so i 'll go there on november and follow up my papers personally and find out why they 're giving me a problem with my papers so  oh my god  oh my god when did you call him about a month words   before november  when did you start hearing the rumor probably august   did somebody check bother to check yeah lita wrote stanford university but you know the the funny thing is wyona yon hindi ba  before the dean uh works on the papers before the appointment is done and 2 words committee the v p a clears the papers  di ba tapos noon go on and hire so we assumed that wyona did all the background checking otherwise she would not have told us okay go on and hire benjie rebullida  so we hired him and i we we gave him associate four which is only for p h d holders  tapos ni- recommend ko pa na  professorial chair holder  it was cleared  yes he was so promising so bright very bright  oo oo  and then so i was told that somebody from abroad came and mentioned that to the international studies people but i didn't believe because i called benjie and he denied not having a p h d and did he show anything no so we went over his papers and uh they you know the people from stanford didn't say he does not have a p h d  ha   oo that 's why wyona gave him they cleared his name but they didn't mention that he has no p h d so we i i wyona must have assumed that okay and then lita wrote  strange 'no  didn't stanford say he 's a graduate or  something like that   no no no basta they cleared name niya but not the degree what do you mean by cleared  that he has no problems but what you are interested in is his degree   it was a character reference it was a character reference yeah a character reference i don't know what wyona asked but that was the paper that i saw  and so lita finally wrote and was told he has no p h d  oh my  that he does not have categorically he does not have a p h d  wala  a p h d break in recording  was he working on his dissertation did he have an academic i think he had a problem with his adviser that was what all of these usually it comes out it was speculation already  oo all of these were rumors rumors  oo   o where is he now he 's still with la salle paying back everything so hindi ba we paid him uh the rate of the associate four  ha  what 's he paying back  e di sobra yung ano he was his rank was changed now so he was made associate siya 'no  now he was made assistant prof and so he 's paying now the difference between assistant and   the chair also four thousand five hundred  associate   and the chair  oh my gosh it 's a wonder that he still sticks around  sabi ko i hope i don't meet him all laugh ba't naman pati yung i called him 'no  and said this is very confidential will you please tell me he said he has a p h d oh my gosh you know i it was manolo who recommended him  hindi ba manolo went abroad so then he brings this benjie rebullida and he says o he has a p h d tatata tatata make sure we don't lose him tatata tatata so ako naman i worked fast and we hired him at lyceum i always told do not take any word of any man or woman who claims to have a p h d if there is no paper attached  kasi i 've learned that early enough in my career as a dean i think you know wyona i have a feeling that wyona considers  manolo 's word parang the guarantee uh no no no  ayan ayan  this is not the first time that it happened in de la salle  di ba  in liberal arts i don't know several cases i guess but i cannot cannot remember a case i usually would tell uh uh paulino i already told you be very very careful as it has strung me once and i will never forget that  and you 'll recall that was only one person that said she graduated as an honor student at u p  oo oo   oo oo  but you know benjie i think didn't apply it was manolo who encouraged him to join la salle all you need is  hindi ba when i applied at de la salle  kumpleto ang papers pati transcript ko  plus the diploma  hay naku i really don't like to see  benjie anymore because i called him i called him  hindi ba si santos also remember that santos guy the one who sang with the chorale french computer ba computer ahh carlo   carlo oo nga  he didn't have a p h d also he did not defend his dissertation or something and yet when people called him doctor he didn't correct them and he was dean so the latest is brother andrew uh is giving him i don't know how true this is 'no up to the end of uh this school year to finish to finish his p h d  to pay   aba where i don't kn stanford  go back ganoon  but has he defended his dissertation and all he needs is to revise you know that 's what i don't know i i don't know we don't know kasi ba't ganoon walang klaro  funny naman stanford  i didn't see the letter of stanford to lita but that was what lita told me wala siyang p h d that 's why he 's paying back
