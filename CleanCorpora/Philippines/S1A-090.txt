""
""
yeah we were talking about your passion for books
""
you you know you bought so many cicero and now even that very humble
uh book you 're still interested uh
""
how come
""
""
yeah i think uhm it 's the it 's about my desire to learn a lot
of things 
""
""
you got it from your your parents and your uncles are 
ano  teachers  'no 
""
""
yeah my my grandfather is a retired supervisor too
""
""
wow
""
""
and
""
""
 supervisors  mean uh means 
supervisor  means he 's in charge of
""
""
uh of a of a   large 
""
""
 overlooking   different groups
""
""
i think several districts
""
""
a supervisor is higher than a principal
""
""
supervisor is higher than a principal
""
  it 's a 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
it 's a step lower than the superintendent
""
""
superintendent
""
 superintendent  meaning
""
""
it 's   superintendent  is i think one
or two steps higher  a superintendent oversees a division
""
""
a region
""
""
a division
""
okay like what is
""
""
what is higher than a superintendent
""
""
uh it 's already the department or division
""
""
 words  decs  acronym for department of
education, culture, and sports  chairman okay
""
""
yeah
""
""
decs  acronym for department of education, culture, and
sports  chairman superintendent and supervisor
""
supervisor
""
""
there are different supervisors
""
there are uh supervisors for like english math and different
subjects
""
""
uh
""
""
yeah
""
""
of a certain province
""
""
of a certain yeah of a certain province
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
so you
""
""
so they 're not he 's not in charge of the school
""
he 's in charge of a department in the school like the english
department
""
""
no actually he 's in charge of several schools in the province
""
""
uh-hmmmh okay
""
""
uh i don't know what the division he is right now but
basically a supervisor depends on the size of the province sometimes oversees
two provinces or even three
""
""
and you 're talking about maybe fifty schools
""
""
maybe more than fifty schools
""
""
wow
""
""
so if you 're a supervisor not a subject supervisor you 're an
administrative supervisor you don't you don't only oversee like the the
specific subject that you 're in charge but you 're administering 
words 
""
""
so he 's he 's an administrative supervisor
""
""
yes he 's actually supervisor two because there 's also a
supervisor one
""
""
what 's that
""
""
uh a little bit lower in designation but it 's  consider
""
""
""
does it pay well
""
""
uh now i think it pays well it pays well
""
but before of course with the the salary scheme in the public in
the public education in the philippines it 's really it 's really i don't
think it pays well
""
but as of this time i think the pay is good
""
""
and that is the father of your   father 
""
""
 yeah   the father of my father
""
yeah my father is an engineer but my the family of where my father
came from are actually teachers
""
the sister the youngest sister of my grandfather is a retired
master teacher
""
""
what 's a master teacher
""
""
uh a master teacher is  actually in relation to salary he
's he or she is equivalent to a principal but uh he or she decided not to
hold administrative position but rather stay in the classroom and teach
""
ok so uh in salary they 're almost the same uh as the principal but
doesn't have administrative role
""
""
master teacher
""
""
master teacher yeah
""
""
but is that category still being used today
""
""
yeah  yeah
""
""
so what what will qualify someone to become uh a master
teacher
""
""
a master teacher actually achieves that position after a long
time
""
you really could not become a master teacher without without really
uh having that experience in the classroom for a long time because that means
you have to earn the respect of the other teachers
""
then you have to respect also the the you earn the respect also of
the the parents of the children that you that you have taught
""
so you it only it only means that you have been in teaching and you
have mastered you have mastered teaching
""
that you are an effective teacher for a long time
""
so there there are  act  it 's actually one of the rankings
that uh every teacher in the public school in in visaya you know
""
so they can after a long time of teaching maybe they can they can
apply for it
""
""
master teacher
""
""
yeah because in the public school there are rankings like you
're you 're an elementary teaching you 're elementary teacher one elementary
teacher two
""
""
  so 
""
""
 elementary   teacher three
""
""
when our graduates passed the the board exam   they 
""
""
 they    words  to the public
schools
""
""
the first the base category is
""
""
yes sir it 's basically just an elementary teacher or  
school  teacher
""
""
 one  
""
""
maybe  one 
""
it depends
""
""
  elementary teacher one 
""
""
 it depends on where   they 're assigned also
because you 're like you are a uh uh grade one teacher or grade two teacher
or grade three teacher but there are still ranking there are still rankings
uh on those levels because you have to also i think you also have to earn
those rankings because the what do you call this the the division office or
the supervisor 's office
""
oh i don't know if they have they have to undergo testing but i
think they have testing and it will also depend on the different evaluations
that the division office or the district office will receive and they will
rank the teachers
""
and your salary also depends on those rankings
""
""
so what is the lowest uhm teacher one
""
""
i think teacher one
""
""
and then teacher two
""
""
teacher two depending on the grade level
""
there are also grade levels  e 
""
so if you 're uh you 're uh an upper grade level teacher one way or
the other and you have a you have a higher ranking you will also receive 
 a higher  salary
""
""
 so   uh one who teaches high school gets a higher
salary compared to one who teaches grade one
""
""
no   no  there are rankings in different uh year
levels
""
""
 uh  
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
so you also will be ranked
""
okay
""
so if you 're ranked the lowest you 'll get you 'll get the lowest
salary
""
""
 talaga 
""
""
i think the problem the problem right now uh with public
schools is that sometimes even in getting a higher rank or getting a
promotion for that matter is usually dependent on whom you know in the office
and sometimes even with evaluation that 's why other people get higher
rankings is because the evaluation are also at times manipulated
""
""
by the students
""
""
no by the by the principal by the by the other people
administering the rank
""
""
so let 's go through the ranking
""
teacher one teacher   two teacher three 
""
""
 teacher two   teacher three yeah
""
""
teacher four
""
""
and different
""
""
is it is it only until teacher three
""
""
uh i don't know right now because it has changed  e
pero   in the past  kasi  like if you are a grade
one teacher uh if
""
for example there are like uh one hundred teachers in a division
or in a district for example okay you might be an elementary teacher one
elementary uh grade one grade one teacher
""
""
 word 
""
""
you 're a grade six teacher but based on the rankings and in
uh together with all the other teachers in the district you 're ranked like
if you are one hundred and you 're ranked one hundred that means you have the
lowest  rank  ranking so that means your salary will be given uh you
will be given i mean the lowest salary based on the scale because they have
several scales  e 
""
""
several   scales 
""
""
 yeah   so you will be ranked uh with all the
other teachers in the in the district and then in your school you will also
be ranked uh
""
""
really
""
""
with all the other teachers in the school
""
""
is that true
""
""
yeah
""
""
even right now
""
""
even right now
""
""
so if there are twenty teachers
""
""
you will you will be ranked where are you in
""
""
my gosh
""
even in private schools
""
""
no  private schools they don't have that
""
""
only public schools
""
""
only public schools
""
i think it is because of the issue of salary and promotions
""
""
oh
""
""
because if you go uh if you go higher in the ranking system
in the end you you will realize that you 're already like you can already be
promoted to principal or assistant principal or maybe if you don't want to be
a principal you can    words   in retiring as a
master teacher
""
""
 a master teacher  
""
tsk tsk tsk
""
""
the the youngest sister of my grandfather is a master teacher
""
my the eldest sister of my father she 's already a school
principal
""
she 's also uh i think a master teacher also
""
""
wow
""
""
my auntie one of my auntie right now
""
""
the sister of your brother
""
""
my the younger sister the sister next to my father is a is i
think she 's a grade six teacher
""
""
she 's also a master teacher
""
""
uh not yet
""
uh the brother uh the brother of my father the one before him
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
was when she 's also he 's also dead now
""
""
huh
""
""
yeah he 's already
""
""
older than your  bro  father
""
""
older than my father
""
uh the brother the brother before my father
""
uh he was i think elementary grade  teach   elemen 
uh grade six elementary teacher
""
so we 're they 're basically they 're all teachers
""
so my desire for books maybe i have i got that from from from the
   words   my father 's family
""
""
 the teaching clan   no
""
i notice several people from bicol
""
it 's either they are teachers or priests
""
""
or military men
""
""
military
""
 talaga 
""
""
well, one brother of my father is a is a constabulary trainor
in camp crame before
""
now another brother was a major in the army and like several
cousins of my father are are actually in the police force
""
so it 's either military or religious leaders priests nuns or
teachers
""
and i think in bicol that 's common because basically bicol is a
religious is a religious region
""
""
oh yeah
""
why is it religious
""
""
oh maybe because of the strong influence of catholicism in
the province
""
my grandfather for example is a
""
""
priest
""
""
uh no
""
he is uh he 's called an he 's he 's a board member of the parish
""
and during holy week he would usually act as one of the disciples
""
remember during holy week they you would see like men uh like uh
asking for donations
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
they 're in like in costumes like they 're apostles the
disciples during the time of jesus
""
so they would usually do that as the part of the work of the
parish
""
they would usually act as disciples or apostles during the holy
week and ask for donations
""
they walk from uh they walk from the parish to the different
 barangays 
""
""
 words 
""
""
no they 're in sandals
""
""
but dressed in
""
""
dressed in like the apostles like they put long clothes and
""
""
who are the people who usually do that
""
""
they are the parish board
""
most of them are members of the board of the parish
""
""
are they respectable men and women   respectable 
""
""
 they 're usually   considered also as respectable
religious leaders
""
""
like the elders of the land     similar to that
""
""
 yeah  
""
they 're not they 're not uh priests they 're uh laymen
""
but they also act as lay ministers  cough 
""
so they can also like they can also like give communions they can
also give uh they can also officiate mass they can also uh
""
""
is there a priest in the family
""
""
with us in among the distant relatives there are priests in
fact parish priests and i don't know if we have a bishop already among the
the uh
""
""
the  pura 
""
""
yeah
""
""
the surname  pura  uh it did did the did
your relatives originally uh did they originate uh from bicol
""
 pura 
""
""
actually
""
""
the pura clan
""
""
our clan came from uh they said it originally came from
iloilo uh but later on migrated to the bicol region  migrated to the bicol
region
""
they 're businessmen and later on became teachers and other
leaders but i don't know
""
uh because most of us came from there most of most of those that i
know with that family name came from that province
""
""
from iloilo
""
""
from iloilo
""
""
 interruption 
""
so the  pura   ha 
""
""
yeah but i think the desire for books is can be traced can be
traced uh can be traced to my father 's family
""
uh my grandfather has maintained   his own library 
""
""
 what is your   what is your  ay 
really
""
the father of your father
""
""
the father of my father has maintained his own
""
""
how many volumes does he own
""
""
uh when i was younger i think it 's a lot
""
there he had about uh maybe three big shelves
""
""
something bigger than this
""
""
well maybe something as big as this but it 's maybe five
layers
""
""
wow
""
""
and he had three of those when he was alive
