""
""
 really  
""
""
yeah
""
""
come on don't lie to me
""
you 've been out almost every day of the week 
""
""

""
""
gimmick as in malls only
""
is that   what you 're saying 
""
""
 yeah   just go to malls just go to starbucks or you know just have coffee and chat with friends but
""
""
yeah that 's not the   kind of gimmick  e  
""
""
 not the kind of gimmick   that you go to bars you get to meet people you get to dance
""
""
boys especially
""
  are you trying to tell  me that
""
""
 yeah  
""
that 's what i 'm pointing out boys 
""
i love boys
""
i miss boys
""
""

""
""
of course
""
""
of course i don't have to miss boys or else my husband is gonna kill me  break in the recording 
""
hey you 've been out of a relationship in almost a year so don't you miss it you know
""
what do you miss most about it
""
""
well
""
""
somebody being there for you
""
""
yeah
""
""
what else
""
""
it kind of bites me once in a while
""
""
the loneliness
""
""
yeah but it 's a good thing that i have my friends
""
""
we 're back again to friends yeah  chuckle 
""
""
yeah 'cause uh they 've done a lot of things for me since i split up with my ex
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 3 words   i 'm just taking care of someone worrying for someone
""
""
can't you do can't you just do that to your friends
""
""
yeah but  you know it 's different
""
""
nah i   understand i understand 
""
""
 the way you care for your friends   is different from the way you care   for  a boyfriend
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
like the way you care for your mom or your dad
""
""
and my baby   definitely 
""
""
 yeah  
""
so i guess  hopefully i 'll  someone would come along  sooner or later  speaker a laughs  hopefully sooner
""
""
well   good luck 
""
""
 like    this saturday
""
""
 laughter  what are you doing about it
""
""
nothing
""
""
i mean   do you go  to bars and go   look for  guys
""
""
 i mean  
""
 yeah  
""
no i don't look for it 'cause i don't believe that you should look for it
""
it just
""
""
yeah
""
""
it just comes along i i do believe in destiny you know
""
""
love is not forced
""
""
yeah
""
""
it just grows 
""
can't force someone to love you
""
""
i 'm just waiting for the this magical thing that i feel like the way i felt with my past relationships
""
""
what is it to that magic thing
""
people always tell me that you have to feel the magic well definitely i 've felt it with my husband but why  speaker b laughs  why why do people place too much importance on that
""
can't they see that when you get married and the routine gets to you it 's not gonna be that magical anymore
""
""
yeah   but 
""
""
 don't you   realize that  it 's gonna be a routinary thing
""
""
i wouldn't know that 'cause i 'm not yet married
""
""
well i 'm telling you you know
""
""
that 's why i 'm still into the magical thing you know
""
""
well it 's so good to be like that
""
""
well i mean experience is the best teacher so i haven't experienced getting married i mean i 'm not yet married so   i wouldn't know 
""
""
 yeah i know    break in the recording 
""
well enough of that magical thingy
""
so what do you fear most in life
""
""
fear  well  what i fear most is death
""
""
why
""
""
i don't   know 
""
""
 everybody   will   die someday 
""
""
 yeah i know   but just the thought of  losing
""
""
someone you   love 
""
""
 yeah   yeah someone i love and i mean not seeing that person every day
""
""
not being able to   talk to that person anymore yeah 
""
""
 not being able to talk to that person or touch that person   it it really gets into me   and also 
""
""
 well  
""
what
""
""
also  one of my fears is also fears is also being lonely
""
""
being lonely
""
""
yeah i just don't want to be alone 
""
""
it 's hard being alone definitely
""
like they said  no man is an island 
""
""
yeah that 's right
""
""
as for me i i fear snakes
""
i hate them
""
i despise them for besides that i would i fear what i fear the most is not being able to be a good mother or wife 
""
it 's not like there are books you could follow or you know   uhm 
""
""
 yeah   unlike in cookbooks you just
""
""
follow the   instructions 
""
""
 yeah   follow the instructions get the ingredients and
""
""
yeah
""
""
voila it 's there 
""
life is really like that
""
""
you just have to do what  you have to do
""
""
yeah
""
do what you think is right
""
do things that you think will make you happy
""
""
make do with what you have
""
""
yeah
""
""
hey i have a question for you
""
""
what
""
""
uh what do you think about teenagers nowadays
""
were you that wild back then
""
""
no
""
""
i know i wasn't
""
""
yeah no  i mean  teenagers nowadays are very extreme  like 
""
""
at thirteen at twelve years old they get to have a boyfriend smoke drink do drugs have sex
""
""
yeah although i did those things
""
""
but not that early
""
""
yeah not that early
""
at the age around seventeen after high school
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
but definitely not grade school  break in the recording 
""
""
what about getting married
""
so when do you plan to get married
""
""
well uhm around twenty-four to twenty-six   i mean 
""
""
 why   so late
""
""
well nowadays it 's really hard to make a living and
""
""
yeah   i know 
""
""
 i think   you have to be financially stable emotionally stable at the same   time  to get into such things   so 
""
""
 definitely  
""
 yes  
""
you have to be mature   in order to  be married to somebody not mature
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah 'cause that 's hard
""
it takes a lot of responsibility to get into one
""
it 's a very serious thing
""
it 's a lifetime thing so
""
""
it 's a lifetime   commitment actually 
""
""
 yeah so you really   have to think about it uhm
""
""
what else is holding you back 
""
finding uh the right kind of guy  laughter 
""
""
yeah same thing same thing as before
""
it 's finding the right person i mean it 's easy to look no it 's easy to look for the the person but looking for the right person the person   who 
""
""
 you   believe in such things the right   person the right man the right one 
""
""
 yeah as i mentioned earlier   i still believe in those things
""
i still believe that there is such thing as as i i mentioned before the magic thing
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and uh you know you just feel it
""
once it 's there it 's there
""
i don't know
""
i 'm not sure 
""
""
how about soul mates
""
""
well i do believe in soul mates but for me soul mates comes in different   aspects 
""
""
 forms  
""
""
yeah yeah different kinds of relationships also like
""
""
uh uhm friendships
""
""
yeah
""
your soul mate can be your mom it can be your brother or even a friend
""
""
yeah
""
""
it 's just someone who you feel close to
""
""
somebody you can connect with
""
""
yeah
 so  how 's your married life
""
""
it 's okay it 's not that it 's not what i expected it would be but it 's definitely great having someone beside you and everything
""
and having a kid to light up your life  ang  corny  laughter 
""
anyway but it 's true you know
""
""
yeah it 's true
""
""
even if you 're tired and everything when you get home you see that smile in your kid  well  it erases all the tiredness away  ye  and
""
""
i can see that
""
i can see how how hard it is to take care of a kid and a husband at the same time
""
but at the same time i  also see the brighter side of it   you know 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
it makes you glow it gives you more uhm sort of inspiration to do things
""
""
yeah definitely   that 's one  of the things that you should remember when getting married
""
""
 that 's why  
""
""
don't just focus on the bad side but you know try try to focus on the good side not dwell on the bad
""
""
yeah
""
""
in order for you to have a good marriage
""
""
uh that i 'd know in time
""
i think i have to look for the person first before i begin to think about those other things
""
""
but sometimes it 's better to be ready for those things
""
like me it wasn't planned right
""
so i was  it was uhm on the spur of the moment  chuckle 
""
""
yeah but i think it 's more  it 's more of a case to case basis like
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
for you it came earlier
""
""
oh right yeah
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
like when i was younger i was expecting that i 'd get married at the age of twenty-two
""
""
but then your dad   says  laughter  
""
""
 but then   now i 'm twenty-two years old
""
""
  and not yet  married
""
""
 it 's like  
""
yeah
""
""
and you don't have a boyfriend yet
""
""
  it 's now  i realize that i 'm not ready
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
that i have   so many things 
""
""
 you still have a   lot to   experience 
""
""
 yeah   so i guess it 's really it 's what you call uhm right time and right place
""
""
uh uhm you have to uhm assess all of the possibilities first before you get married 'cause it 's one of uh it 's one hell of a job to be married and to take care of a kid
""
