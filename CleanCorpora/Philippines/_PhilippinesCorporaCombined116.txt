that becomes our background against which we can discuss uh judge the different theories that we will uh encounter when we do a review of the history of grammatical theory but without a measuring rod you won't know how to evaluate 'no  so that 's why we have to do also a little bit of linguistic analysis but this is not a course on linguistic analysis it 's a it 's a course on uh on grammatical theory so it 's actually a consideration of the various uh grammatical theories that were worked out by man in in the effort to understand the structure of language and how to describe language as efficiently as possible so uh we have the first uh the c here we are now on c because we finished a and b and so we uh we 'll talk about linguistic analysis and uh we find out that in our modern approach to language uh description we identify the different linguistic units in terms of their composition their distribution and their uh various functions okay uh okay now we say for instance p is a phoneme and it has aspirated p in english in initial position followed by a vowel before a vowel then it is uh in after an initial uh consonant it is p without aspiration these are the different distributions in initial position when it is followed by a vowel it is aspirated when it is uh after a uh consonant like spit spit it 's not uh before consonant uh it is not uh aspirated so there 's non no aspiration we can actually put that writes on board but that 's very narrow transcription then in final position we we did say that it is always released a big difference between that and english uh eh in tagalog in tagalog you say takip  we don't release the p ha takip uh uh halip ganon   ulap   halip   ha   ulap   ulap  you see p is not released so fina in final position in final position okay so this is just distribution 'no  now the phoneme p is in contrast with the voiced counterpart which is b  now how do we how do we uh identify the p the phoneme p  because it is bilabial we will we 're going to go into the details of this then it is stop stop then it is voiceless you see how you breathe and then aspirate it here aspirated plus aspiration in uh initial position uh and in final position uh released as as opposed to tagalog which is unreleased 'no  so now what are we doing when we say it is a stop and it 's bilabial it 's voiceless what what are we do students answer briefly but inaudible  this is the composition yeah these are the various features that compose the phoneme p  so first by composition and then we do it by distribution cough   distribution  and then by function because it has a contrastive function in other words uh p and b in english are they are they 're signals uh minimum signals of distinction they are not themselves meaningful but they distinguish meaning pit and bit pit and bit in english would distinguish so there is differential differential uh uh meaning that that they signal the difference between pit and bit 'no  but in themselves phonemes do not have meanings okay but now cough they can also have referential meaning in that they refer to pit and not to bit  in other words bit is a different kind of experience that they refer to as different from pit which is a difference in meaning okay so now i have given you we i find that we have to do some articulatory phonetics if only to so page three of the handout uh if only to make you uh aware that this was the result of a lot of work by panini he he was panini he he was a hindu scholar who tried to uh uh his name is panini  no pa pa that nasal pa pangini the the eh dot under here this means the nasal nasal vowel uh a nasal uh word panini nini nini oo  he he he did he actually uh analyzed the vocal organs speech organs very accurately 'no and you see what happens is the diaphragm from the air hits the uh the lungs and then we ex exhale uh some air 'no  now what happens is like an instrument like a flute 'no  we we can modify the vocal tract so the pharynx and it goes to the oral cavity normally when it 's done then the uvula uh blocks the nasal cavity okay so the vocal cords are the ones that uh vibrate they are the ones that are very oo they produce vibration 'no and and from the shape of the uh vocal cords you can have whispering when when you whisper the vocal cords are fixed and there is a little outlet at the bottom 'no because the vocal cords have a two uh what do you call these caritoids  those are two bones that uh are more or less triangular in shape and when they do like this uh you you have what is called whispering  and in and there is a a little bit of air that that escapes and that is word harsh sound speaker breathes to demonstrate his point ha ha ha  yeah that the position of the vocal cords is like that but normally the vocal cords are open and that 's the one that vibrates and that causes vibrations in the air   air  and that 's the one that gives you high frequency or low frequency depending on how how often yeah the pitch varies depending on how how often the the vibrations occur if it 's very high sound the vibrations are very fast if it 's very low sound the vibrations are slow are slow  slow  okay uh then there from the stream of air coming up from the diaphragm and the lungs ha  then you you have some what is happening is like that something like this 'no like uh like the saxophone but in the saxophone the air this thing is coming from there not and not this one is the opposite the air is coming from inside 'no going out then this this uh oral cavity becomes a resonating chamber and there is a velum here that that the velar velum is that middle bell-shaped organ that if you look at the mirror and look at you open your mouth you will see we call it tonsils a student chuckles   uvula   students answer in chorus uvula  the uvula in french that uvula can be made to vibrate speaker demonstrates the vibration oh that 's so the speaker demonstrates the vibration the r in in a in in french is made by making the uvula vibrate o red o red o yes o red oo  but otherwise the function of the uvula is to close the nasal cavity so that you have a clear oral passage 'no  okay so there is what uh you have 'no  now what happens is that there is a series of occlusions and uh and partial occlusions so that you produce the different sounds of speech but the main thing is there is an instrument for making noise 'no  that that 's what 's called uh the speech organs 'no  they are the ones that are really responsible for articulating language and because these speech organs have to move uh ther there is the tongue blade there is the teeth and so on so the the speech organs have to move from one position to the other in order to produce the sounds that 's what causes linearity in what we hear because there is a sequencing of before and after because the movements of the speech organs uh also shift from one position to the other to produce uh these various sounds okay now you you look at it 'no the look at the uh consonant chart now here is a consonant chart uh and then we will look at our uh our sagittal diagram it 's called sagittal diagram  that 's it 's called sagittal because sagitta in in in uh latin means the arrow it 's the side diagram  sagittarius yeah sagittarius yes from that that same uh root see if you uh halve the uh if you divide the uh face of man or the head of a man can you get the sagittal uh diagram of here 'no but you see uh if you look at this again i 'll come back to the consonants the the very first type of sound tha that is produced is bilabial sound so what what is involved in the production of bilabial sound  upper lip and lower lip   the two lips upper and lower lips okay there you see at the on your diagram okay the two lips okay now if it is uh de dent uh  dental sound no labiodental   students answer in chorus labiodental  no the lower lip  lower lip and the upper teeth  fa fa fa   f fricative or the fricative f that becomes labiodental 'no now interdental  teeth upper no the tongue the the uh thing for instance when you say thing thing oh  upper and lower teeth tip of the tongue the tip of your tongue is between the two teeth the upper and lower teeth 'no laughter   and lower teeth  yeah okay then uh after that uh you have uh  alveolar so that when you uh make thin then and fat and that and then pit and bit then you come to alveolar the alveolar means that your tongue the front blade of the tongue is touching this alveolar ridge there is a ridge at the back of your teeth the gums the gums on the top at the back of the teeth are this is called the alveolar ridge  and in english you say cat ten ten but not in tagalog in tagalog we say ten ten  it 's dental  dental oo   ten ten tao tao we we hit the t   maraming tao  no laughter we laugh when we do that because that 's what the americans say tao mga anak tao   maraming tao   maraming tao because they are used to putting the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge   students answer in chorus alveolar ridge  okay that 's what produces that uh what do you call the uh sound of english t and d uh it 's alveolar then alveo-palatal sh and dz  what happens is the the middle part of the tongue is put up against the roof of the mouth 'no  uh sh you hear this the shin shin and chin chin and chin uh in chin there is an element of stop but this one is friction yes friction chin or uh vision vision   vision   vision ther there is a d and then the k and the g the back part of the tongue is against the  velum against the velum oh the velum is that part of the section of the back part of the mouth that is soft that 's called velum 'no  when we were students when we were students we had to to use a uh a mirror and look and fix it  mirror  but you are not actually going to be phoneticians so you will have no exercises in phonetics because we had hours and hours of it transcribing what we hear sounds of different languages and we had to be very particular now uh there is such a thing as narrow transcription and broad transcription   narrow transcription is what we call phonetics 'no  everything we hear we symbolize but in phonemics 'no we are concerned with the phoneme and we are concerned with classes of sounds here you look at this class of sound p has this different variants 'no these different variants p aspirated uh p non-aspirated and p released in final position these are only variants of the same uh p the class of p and you know english speakers do not distinguish between p aspirated and p non-aspirated they cannot hear that they they still consider that p but strange strange because they would they 're expecting that explosion to be there in in the initial position if you they don't hear it they think it 's a b that is pronounced because b is not aspirated yeah  aspirated
