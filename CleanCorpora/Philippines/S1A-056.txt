""
what 's pornography  next question
""
""
no honestly
""
""
is that something you can give a definitive answer to
""
""
or personal choice personal perspective
""
""
wouldn't yeah it 's subjective
""
""
subjective
""
oh what would you consider as pornographic
""
""

""
""
 kasi  we we were discussing  ekis
""
""
""

""
""

""

""
""
theater   or cable 
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
uh good shots
""
i missed my old school
""
""
why
""
""
it was shot at normal
""
""
uh okay
""
""
so i was so busy identifying the places  laughter  i
didn't get to catch whatever story it has
""
""
if it had a story
""
""
yes
""
""
in the first place
""
""
i don't think so
""
""
hypothetically if you find the  laughter  the
cr&eacute;me  laughter  stuff
""
""
what
""
""
speak up pam  laughter 
""
""
so what 's pornographic
""
""
i 'm eating
""
""
if it 's graphically described
""
""
yeah oh
""
""
and it 's  baboy   laughter 
""
""
  wouldn't be 
""
""
 i 'm so    ano e  i 'm prude when
it comes to those things
""
""
   pero  
""
""
 is it easier   to identify pornography in
""
""
movies
""
""
in something
""
""
movies
""
""
in movies or
""
""
visuals
""
""
  visuals 
""
""
 visuals  
""
""
yes
""
""
naked woman
""
""
not really
""
""
  it would depend 
""
""
 but what about something printed  
""
""
uh  e   xerex   column
in a tabloid 
""
""
uh
""
""
pornographic
""
i think in a sense yes because its intention is to make an impact
""
""
i have to abstain
""
i have not seen a single  xerex  material
""
""
yeah sure
""
""
but you know  xerex  personally 
laughter 
""
""
pam stop eating  naman 
""
""
you 're stuffing your   face with food 
""
""
 no   
""
if  ano  uhm it has something to do with intention
""
""
the purpose if there 's a purpose is that pornographic
""
""
so it should intentionally uh
""
""
  if you portray 
""
""
 perform  
""
""
this is what you were talking about earlier
""
""
yeah
""
""
 eating in 
""
""
can we recite the poem for them  laughter 
""
 genitalia  con   pulot
 
""
""
no because this is the first time that i i asked them the
question
""
is it pornographic
""
""
uhm
""
""
what did they say
""
""
uhm actually i have the answers here
""
""
the girls would probably say it is
""
""
  no 
""
""
 no in fact  
""
""
no ironically it would be the guys telling me
""
""
 talaga 
""
""
is this pornographic
""
they go miss no it 's not pornographic
""
okay answer
""
""
uhm
""
""
is it pornographic
""
it is not pornographic
""
it is metaphoric
""
the comparison of women and food is the art itself
""
okay
""
""
simile metaphor
""
""
 speaker turns pages of paper  next uh the woman
""
no wait
""
the woman is portrayed as a commodity not necessarily with a value
but an item which any man can treat at his own disposal be it for lust or
love
""
the group thus agrees of its pornographic nature due to the
inhuman treatment of the woman
""
""
inhuman
""
""
inhuman
""
""
inhuman
""
""
 parang iba naman yata 'yan 
""
""
 cough  no it 's not pornographic
""
""
  emphatic 
""
""
 see   there is only one guy here out of what five
girls one guy
""
it was the guy who told me the author is trying to present a woman
as a man 's answer to his sexual fantasies   by using  food as an
object of comparison and description
""
for the girls they they trivialize sex
""
he trivialized sex but he feels it 's not pornographic
""
""
 who  
""
""
uhm
""
""
and last no it 's just it is just suggestive and it is not
graphic
""
so the basis would be if it is very graphic     it 's
pornographic
""
it was not written in an offensive way
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
because one of them claimed that he suddenly thought of food
""
""
  uh uhm 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
which are biological needs
""
""
yeah
""
""
 di ba 
""
""
actually one of them just realized later on that it is all
about a woman  speaker a coughs 
""
so which is which
""
""
because i was thinking since he portrayed the woman as an
object which is something like sex object object of his desire
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
would that count as pornographic when you trivialize women
""
""
was he
""
""
example only
""
""
uh uh
""
""
treating her as an object comparing her to food
""
would that already be in the context of object of desire
""
""
but if it were but if he intended it to mean that he needs uh
the woman as much as he needs food
""
in that sense basic need
""
""
uhm
""
""
would that make it pornographic
""
do you find that in the in the poem
""
""
no it 's uh
""
""
it 's not
""
""
comparing the woman to special recipes
""
""
it 's just comparison
""
""
from different regions right
""
but
""
""
let me see the crispy  pata  of her
""
""
 oo 
""
""
and eating in
""
""
and
""
""
and devour
""
where 's the book
""
""
and uh how did he describe the breasts of a woman
""
""
uhm
""
""
 nata 
""
""
yeah
""
""
or something
""
""
charette you read  speaker a chuckles 
""
 laughter  you 're stuffing yourself again charette
""
""
you found it
""
where did you find it
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
no i found this thing  speaker c laughs 
""
""
chuchi
""
""
she stole it
""
we 'll help her find the book so that she could treat us or else
she 's going to pay
""
""
yeah imagine
""
that 's a thousand bucks
""
""
essentially clear
""
""
wouldn't that be such a
""
""
waste of money
""
""
yeah
""
""
  when you could 
""
""
 i promise  
""
""
feed us every day
""
""

""
""
at least we 're happy
""

myself
""
""
