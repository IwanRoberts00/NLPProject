good morning lulu good morning li uh lito how are you today well i 'm fine thank you but the rains are quite bad uh did you experience any traffic problems on the way to the office apparently there are less people traveling now because of the weather uh i heard in the news that uh this morning the elementary and high school uh students uh are are excused to go to the school right now but in certain areas i think only not not in the entire uh n c r = national capital region but in certain areas like manila malabon navotas marikina but i think in para&ntilde;aque there is still school quezon city also has school well last night the weather the the rain was so hard and uh it caused a lot of flood our street was flooded again i think this is basically because of the typhoon that got stuck in uh the balintang channel it hasn't moved and it has been uh triggering the monsoon in manila even though we are not covered by typhoon signal number one but this weather disturbance uh uh is quite quite uh much better compared to last year 'no  i think last year we experienced much much worse uh uh rainfall 'no when we had a lot of big floods but i think this one is also a major disaster because so many towns in bulacan are under water up to now and many believe that the water will stay there for some time it has not receded well in uh pampanga also i think there is again uh a report about a problem on road road uh uh prob uh you know the the water is uh the bridges are you know are almost being overflowed overflowed uh  all the roads are flooded  washed away yeah  lahar has been washed away again  any problems on your uh what about your farm lits it 's under water  laughter well uh in zambales i think it 's a high high area do you do we experience uh flooding in that area well my area is in the mountains so there 's no flooding but uh if the rains continue the la you know the land becomes very soaked in water and we could say it 's water-logged and some of the it 's not stable anymore some of the loose soil uh slide down in the slope too much water will destroy your crops you mean to say that there are a lot of cut trees also in your area no actually we are planting trees we are allocating one hectare just for the forest we are reforesting the place and uh it will be a very it will be high density uh we are putting hardwood trees in that uh particular hectare but uh is it difficult to reach your area when it 's uh rainy season or well there 's a road you can reach the area but it 's difficult to walk in the farm because of the it 's a slope so you could slide but the problem is uh you have to pass pampanga in order to reach zambales  uh  we go via pangasinan pangasinan but it 's a long way e  uh you add one and a half hours to the trip just to reach your place yes but uh during this time i don't think the fruits uh prices are down because of uh of this weather many crops will be damaged so i assume uh you have to pay a high price for your vegetables i think even fishponds uh have problems right now overflowing  overf yeah so many many of the neighbors will be very happy because they can get fish for free ha  uhm did you see uh mr the the president uh looking at the uh manila bay area  there is so much garbage ha   yeah yeah  yeah that 's right well uh a year ago they had this advertisement saying that if you throw your garbage it 's gonna come back to you   come back  it will come back to you so today uh that has become a reality and the garbage has come back to us  it 's gonna come back to you  i didn't know that uh some of the uh garbage guys are disposing their garbage in the sea ha  people along the squatter area they just dispose their garbage basically the main problem is the attitude this they want to keep themselves clean but they don't take the responsibility of cleaning their environment the i think it 's very typical of filipinos they are very clean with themselves but outside around them they don't maintain it clean you mean they clean themselves without cleaning their surroundings lits it follows sometimes that they don't care whether it reflects your personality once you keep yourself clean you also keep your surroundings clean not really uh they will throw their garbage at their neighbor 's place it is because they live in a surrounding which is not really that clean so naturally it comes you know laughter in the way they live but filipinos normally are clean with themselves they know how to take a bath every day even though they are in the squatter area uh-huh but where they dispose their garbage god knows because the garbage problem is not really a problem that you keep to yourself it 's an it 's an economic and social problem it 's a problem of the the city di ba  how how you dispose of your garbage that 's one reason  talking of  speaking of uh disposing of garbage i think they have opened again the uh this garbage dump in tondo  landfill  smokey smokey mountain smokey mountain yeah  they 're dumping again   because i think uh the the current uh dumping ground in payatas i think is scheduled to be closed so  yes   the one that 's in uh the one that is located in uh near antipolo uhm it 's going to be closed by the end of the year and i think uh the metro manila authority has not found a suitable replacement up to this point in time they were thinking of cavite but uh the i think the local government people there does not allow this to happen because it will cause a lot of environmental problems i think no one nobody likes garbage likes garbage how could they do it in other countries do you do you know of any of the systems that is being done in the other countries well most uh countries they do they have a recycling program where bottles or plastics are stored in or thrown in a special uh disposal area let 's say all bottles are consolidated uh all papers are also consolidated in one area and then these are all recycled and then let 's say organic garbage such as uh kitchen refuse normally it goes to their sewage system because they have what we call uhm digester in their sinks well in the philippines our sewage system exists only in manila and especially in the old part of manila and the rest they don't have the sewage system and the system in manila is an old system way way back pre-war years i think yes it 's pre-war years and that 's why in certain uh houses in malate ermita they don't have uhm septic tanks because it 's all disposed in the sewage system separate the rest of us the rest of the areas make use of the septic tank another thing that uh the problem of manila is the transportation ano  they could not organize themselves in such a way that uh it will be advantageous to the people you know like for example in in other countries they have this uh well organized uh mass transport system mass transport of course we have already started the m t r should be m r t which stands for metro rail transit the l r t light railway transit but uh we need to have more hopefully i think we need to have more i think we have to have good links with this uh rail system when after the people are going down in their station they have connections yeah you know jun how i wish they they had you know built a train along along the south super highway rather than built that skyway because it will be more advantageous if they ever did the train thing yeah but they then i won't be able to bring my car to makati anymore   no need to bring yeah but the other thing i heard that uh ayala is uh thinking of that  yeah  supposed to be that uh that that that pro project yeah supposed to be but i 'd i hope ayala will not change its mind especially now that uh the the oil prices are uncontrollable ha   its mind  yes you know it 's so expensive it 's not easy to bring your i think the the more they raise it the more our economy will be affected uh negatively because it might cause some recession  your car every day  and uh you you can also notice our economy our economic situation right now is not in at its best you can see that the philippine peso has gone down to yes forty-four to one again one u s dollar is in fact uh some of them are projecting that this will go up up to forty-six pesos and this will affect the cost of fuel 'no  yeah because first the cost of money and then the cost also of the oil it 's quite the oil has increased in cost although saudi arabia is trying to produce more to bring down the cost of the oil this will be a domino effect again now when we increase the oil prices prices of goods will go up and then uh the workers will demand then people will demand for more wages right and then what will be the result we will not be competitive in the world market anymore i think we no longer are competitive we 're only good for expensive items or specialty items that can be only produced here but if they cannot be produced here normally the other countries like thailand china indonesia and especially maybe the former communist countries like burma and maybe in the near future north korea will be uh benefiting from the the world market because of the they have lower prices because in the year two zero zero four it 's going to be a global uh world market uh there will be no more import restrictions  whoever can produce th the cheapest and high quality uh will will be able to be the successful one  no more quotas  but i think that 's a very myopic view from the point of view of the of the rich countries what do you mean myopic why because they only look from their own point of view actually the ones who benefit are the rich countries do you mean do you mean   poor countries will become poorer do you mean to say that we should still impose uh import restrictions i believe so  in a way   to protect the local industries in a way that will help us that 's a commitment  what do you mean commitment  commitment if there are quotas i am committed to share this much  uh yes of course because there are still restrictions restraints quantitative limits but if there are no res it 's a global market so everybody is fighting for for his own product who buys the best who buys the cheapest that 's true and uh you can see the development in the uh in the i t ha in the information technology a lot of people are using now the what is called the e commerce the electronic commerce and it 's very popular that uh a lot of companies are putting up their own web websites or web browsers or something like that  uh what do you think do you think even our company i think is uh going to come up with this kind of uh operations wherein the we will put up a web website and then interlink it with our uh business partners like uh like our suppliers like our suppliers and then accessory suppliers you know they can put these goods suppliers they can put input there the latest uh prices   products that they have prices and then the suppliers can uh immediately come up with their own uh selling prices based on those things so you can actually do your shopping using the internet yeah shopping i think is now now more feasible in by using the internet is that what they call on-line shopping  yeah that 's on-line shopping   and it 's cheaper
