 music there is something about the araneta coliseum rainy days in july the blaring sounds of bass drums and snare drums the blaring trumpets and it makes you say it smells like school spirit all over again welcome everyone we 're back for more for season sixty-four of the u double a p first stop u p fighting maroons going up against the adamson falcons and in our second game the u s t growling tigers going up against our mighty host the far eastern university tamaraws we 're coming to you live from the araneta coliseum in the heart of quezon city i 'm mico halili with professor randy sacdalan by my side to welcome you to u a a p sixty-four uh partner it doesn't get 'no it doesn't get any any better than this one you know you can feel the excitement  basketball vacation is over it 's time to roll out the ball and you know play some good basketball and what a game to start things off u p fighting maroons against adamson falcons boy it 's gonna be one big start for sixty-four okay we had a great time bringing you season sixty-three last year and we expect this season to be uh to give us more fun more excitement first game u p versus adamson two teams uh which carried the losing record last year but uh a lot of promise for the two teams involved and the two coaches as well well of course u p went through some uh soul-searching 'no  they got four wins last year but why could they not have come out stronger they have some new recruits for uh the fighting maroons they look for a better year this year they 're looking to get into the final four for coach ryan gregorio it 's something that he has waited for more than ten months and he wants to get back uh here in the u a a p while for luigi trillo well it was his birthday yesterday 'no and i think he wants a fitting tribute to the start of the season he wants to get to the winning track for the adamson falcons okay before we get to the two teams the two combatants this afternoon let 's explain the battlefield for u a a p sixty-four well all the teams would have to play two games for each team total of fourteen so the u p fighting maroons will get to play adamson falcons twice until the eighteenth words and the top four will go to the uh semi-finals wherein the top two teams one and two will play three and four with a twice-to-beat advantage for the first two teams and of course the winners will fight it out for the best-of-three championship for uh u a a p sixty-four well a lot of people can't wait for the u a a p final four this year but uh we 'll go through the individual wars and battles for these teams after talking about the format let 's go through the officiating we have a lot of rule changes uh this year friend well of course the asian basketball academy chose now to uh help the u a a p and take over things in terms of officiating well the first one the four ten-minute period is no longer played in half so the teams just have to make this adjustment a lot of them have prepared for this the eight-second back court rule similar to our m b a so it 's gonna be a faster movement from the back court to the front court and of course the three referees is an innovation in amateur basketball in the u a a p wherein you know they 've even uh invited darrel garretson to to help us out in the three referees i think that 's gonna change a lot of the rules and the way things are played in the u a a p mico hey one thing to watch out for when you look at the referees this year is how they will position themselves that was the biggest lesson they learned from veteran n b a referee darrel garretson when he visited and when he trained our u a a p referees so watch out how they position themselves on the court and how they make the calls again a pleasant pleasant saturday afternoon from the big dome  let 's talk about the u p fighting maroons one of our combatants this afternoon u p finishing with a four and ten record good for sixth place last year but but people may not know it 's a fact that they had close games last year well the point that you 're raising mico is the six to ten losses there were four four points in 1 word but the biggest deficit that they yielded was ten points 'no  for a team to go out on a losing record with that kind of a a margin you know you can't help but feel you know it 's okay it 's okay 'no  you gave it your all there were no blown-out games for them and they got into three overtime games and look they the sixty-eight point eight points per game is you know is something that uh 2 words  it 's not the way that u p played the game that yielded most number of points to the opponents but it 's how really how they played the game and how they lost by a very little margin through the sixty-third u a a p okay we 're about to talk about two young men who made strong impressions last year we 're talking about uh michael bravo and robson bornancin the u p community calls them the killer bees bravo a former san beda red cap bornancin coming out of the brent basketball system impressive numbers for bornancin most especially as a rookie uh yes he almost made it as rookie of the year for rob bornancin and for michael bravo it was really a coming out year he was able to get the confidence of uh uh ryan grego gregorio and the rest of uh the team but you know the trouble with bornancin he 's very young with his third worst three point six errors but that could be forgiven now you 're looking at a tougher rob bornancin a more intelligent player and michael bravo i think very very confident this young man 'no he has established himself as the shootingest of the maroons and an heir to uh paulo mendoza for the u p fighting maroons okay so those are the dependables for uh coach ryan gregorio let 's talk about uh players we did not see last year but could have a big impact for the maroons this year patrick madarang was part of u p before uh he left after uh he left for a year and then we 're about to meet kenneth robin uhm this find of uh of the u p coaching staff from cebu these are two players who just might be the difference between a losing record and a slot in the final four well patrick madarang words this is his last year in the u a a p no more edric ferrer they could be looking for leadership from patrick madarang 'no  he brings about the seniority and stability in the line-up for kenneth robin of course i can see him from this distance as 'no uh we were told a lot of uh baby fat still surrounding his uh elbows well he shows a lot of promise and u p went into a runner-up finish uh last in the last philippine youth basketball league that should make it very exciting for this young ball club from u p diliman  laughter e a lot of observers have said that u p was just a big 1 word in the court last year of making a better uh impression or getting a better record after season sixty-three so that 's for u p a lot of promise for this team it 's a bigger team a more experienced team so a lot to watch out for for the u p fighting maroons let 's switch over to the other side the adamson falcons led by the youthful head coach luigi trillo they learned as a team they had they learned a lot of lessons from last year 's debacle so too much a pain to handle for from last year going uh winless in one season and the last win coming in august nineteen nineteen ninety-nine at uh over uh f e u but you know look at that uh team things for for adamson 'no they 're so much down at the basement 'no there 's no other direction for them but up the losing margin thirteen point eight is the biggest margin they were last in this very important statistical department and you know they 're really looking forward into this uh season they wanna get back to they had several close ball games last year i remember one overtime game against u s t it was there but they missed out on the three free throws could not extend it to the second overtime and uh who knows this might be the game to start things right for the falcons it could be a break-out season for them very young uh squad for the adamson coach luigi trillo will rely on the leadership of melvin mamaclay uh you 're about to see his numbers mamaclay had nine point two points per game four point six rebounds per outing uh he is one one of the dependable holdovers for coach trillo well he won't be uh well so many guys have graduated the likes of bruce lee uh no more eu uh cris eusebio no longer in the team but mamaclay well he was in the line-up of welcoat who was 1 word the last champions in the last p b l so that should put some stability into his ball game melvin mamaclay plus you know the rookies would be looking for uh mamaclay 's leadership on the floor 'no  he he could not afford to do mistakes as you take a look at uh the good players for adamson when we talked with coach luigi trillo during the free season he was so excited about his youngsters mark abadia steve rolan and ramil tagupa when i look at rolan now i could remember him him in the junior p b l he 's a stocky guy who could do things  that 's melvin mamaclay for you  so mark abadia who plays number two is one exciting guy that they got from uh cebu mico i think we 'll have the numbers of uh we have the numbers of uh mark abadia later on and then tagupa plays the one for the adamson falcons 'no  it 's a new team they went into the 3 words in preparation for this u a a p i think they 're gonna go better they 're gonna go still on the triangle offense on the part of luigi trillo 's uh philosophy for the adamson falcons okay we 'll talk more about this first game of season sixty-four between the adamson falcons and the u p fighting maroons when the u a a p returns here on studio twenty-three  music friends welcome back to the big dome the araneta coliseum and the return of the u a a p here on studio twenty-three we have with us to complete our team our student laughter courtside reporters of course the u p community will be represented ably by mr jorell legaspi and then adamson will be represented by aileen sabiaga two new faces that you 'll get used to throughout the duration of u a a p sixty-four we 'll start with this gentext report on the u p fighting maroons courtesy of jorell jorell good afternoon jorell reports  absolutely perfect report from jorell uh legaspi uh and now uh let 's go turn over to the reporter from adamson uh ms aileen sabiaga good afternoon aileen music  okay it appears we 'll have to wait for a second for that talking about u p uh again a lot of promise for uh for this young team a lot of close losses last year but uh three key big key additions big man wise for coach ryan gregorio that 's right 'no robin will put bornancin in a more familiar position for him that will be three and four so he won't be tendering much of the boards but looking really to score his numbers 'no and i think that 's one big advantage for u p okay let 's go quickly to ms aileen sabiaga from the adamson side aileen aileen reports  i think that is one thing these two young coaches will do a lot of this year and that is to communicate with their players uh coach ryan gregorio and coach luigi trillo two of the most vocal most emotional coaches we have in the u a a p i think they 're very good at that you know considering that they 're also broadcasters themselves 'no speaker a laughs  the power of communication is very much inside them and i think it 's the chemistry of the new players blending with the veterans that 's gonna put that '' be given premium at least for this game 'no the adamson with five holdovers the rest new players boy that 's gonna need a lot of chemistry to happen if they want to pull one over u p this afternoon it 's a new year it 's a new season for these two teams hoping to redeem themselves from disappointing season last year mike bravo he will be in charge of providing the scoring sock for the fighting maroons oh yes and uh u p starters mainly are the holdovers bravo jomaleza celo bornancin and santos you know they wanna make sure that no many not too many mistakes to start things for uh coach ryan gregorio while for uh adamson well that you 're looking at coach ryan gregorio i think he 's more subdued at the start of the season for now   yeah   he he has more time to prepare that 's the difference right right from last year he mentioned that he was really too weak to be able to prepare his team now no no reason for them to uh start things cold while for adamson it 's really a very young team two rookies or actually three rookies in the first five of coach luigi trillo in tagupa rolan and abadia so only yong and mangulabnan we don't even have a mamaclay in the first five of adamson
