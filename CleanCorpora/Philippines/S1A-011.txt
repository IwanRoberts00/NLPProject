""
""
yeah  did you get my point now  cough 
""
""
i don't think convenient purposive sampling is a delimitation
""
i think it 's part of the scope
""
  why would we  delimit the study
""
""
 you think so  
""
okay so put it in the scope  no problem
""
""
okay
""
""
okay so what else
""
well for the others  just think it over and try to find out what are the other possible uhm scope or delimitations which you might encounter or we might encounter during the  study itself
""
anyway uhm just to be sure bobby told us  na  not to not to stress on this part yet because we 're not yet sure on what we 're going to focus it on
""
so just add the note there that this uh this scope and limitation is not yet permanent
""
it 's not it 's only temporary because we 're not yet sure if we 're really going to encounter these limitations
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay
""
so is that clear
""
""
yes it is
""
""
okay so the significance is clear and the scope is clear
""
now let 's go to the things that bobby told me or was discussed okay
""
""
  do i  need to take down notes
""
""
 so  
""
it 's up to you if you 'd like to okay
""
so uhm the first thing we talked about was about the review of lit  = literature  since it was that one that we really referred to or you were supposed to talk about during the meeting okay
""
now in the discussion of the review of lit he told us the review of lit was okay
""
in fact the the the funny part  nga  however was uhm when he gave the when he gave these little pieces of review of lit not the actually the review of lit
""
he was so happy because he found out that he was not going to have a hard time with us
""
it seems our mind was loose and indirect and was flow was flowingly good when we gave out or we handed out the real review of lit his mind began to get boggled up yeah there was so many uhm
""
""
it became complicated
""
""
it became complicated
""
from the easy thing it became so complicated
""
so  that 's why he told us to uh limit down or cut down on some of the things that we have in our study or in our review of  lit 
""
so uh first and foremost the so  it 's okay the parts
""
uh we have to talk about something about uh poverty  something about uh about uh  aspirations and uh but we have to include another factor and the uhm and that is supposed to be uhm more on the coping patterns and the uh what are the usual resources uh usually encountered during the process
""
and at the same time  he also made mention since we have this is the thing that we have to submit for monday  e  which tess forgot that we should do
""
anyway i 'll just call him just call her up and i 'll tell her maybe we 'll just make it up  na lang  on monday afternoon before we we attend bobby 's  ano tapos  to formulate so that when we submit it it 's okay  na 
""
now that part  kasi  we have to figure out what are the questions or the questions that were  kasi  bobby told us to formulate fifteen questions and these fifteen questions are supposed to be geared in finding out the things we want to learn
""
so for uh one question in finding out uh what are their goals  tapos  how did they reach their goals the problems reaching their goals and how do they cope in reaching their goals
""
 tapos  another problem which is uhm uh uhm assigned or which was uh related to this was also in knowing uhm what will be the uh bracket of the people that we will be studying
""
will it be by family or or by age
""
uh tess and i told bobby that we 'll be studying by age groups so
""
""
age groups
""
""
yeah so adults you know adolescents uh elderly
""
now uh when it comes to that we have to figure out or we 'll have to add into our review of related literature  the developmental stages
""
""
  uhm 
""
""
 yes   so we don't know who 's going to do that yet
""
that 's why  it 's imperative that next week we start revising our review of lit because we 're going to be starting to work on our chapter two and at the same time revising our review of lit because if we don't start already which is supposed to be today  nga  if we weren't able to meet as a whole today we start it next week
""
and midterms next week so many tests we have to find a date and really start it and work it out 'cause if we don't do it we 're not going to finish on time
""
we 're not going to make the best out of our thesis  okay
""
so those are the things he told about the review of lit
""
now  when it goes  naman  to the review of lit again he said  na  uh it was it 's proper  daw kasi  we gave data okay
""
uh the proper format will be to give the data then after giving the data is to to try to relate that data with our study
""
 tapos  uh if and that could be related by either uhm formulating a question or formulating previous studies which are associated with uh what we are studying which could be related to that
""
so what i mean is when when we have like for example for the poverty or the poor you 've gathered the data so now that we know how many people are poor in the country how would we associate that to uh our study
""
what 's the importance of that to our study
""
so we could uh stress  daw  in question form like uh uhm if there are so many people who are poor in a country uhm what impact would this have on their  ano  on their aspirations in life
""
so something to associate it with because our output was okay in the sense that it had content
""
the problem was it lacked a little bit in direction
""
so we have to direct it
""
so we have to really we have really to smooth some of the edges which are a little bit rough and i think it there are lots of rough edges
""
for the indigenous method uh tess will be the one to handle that
""
anyway uh it 's quite easy  naman  what bobby wants to do for that
""
then uh i think that 's all
""
so i already discussed to you about the scope and delimitation and together with the significance of the study  the frame of his mind
""
so if i were you i 'd look for a book related to uh  adler
""
""
or jung
""
""
or jung or why is it important
""
uh maybe you would like to talk some more and especially in english
""
i 'm the one who 's talking and talking and this tape is running
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
why so short my goodness  b laughs 
""
i 've been talking so long in english and you 're not saying anything
""
""
so that 's it  na 
 are we through
""
""
well i think so  unless you have some more questions
""
""
i have a question
""
""
yes
""
""
but it 's not related to our thesis
""
""
okay
""
""
it 's about psycho two  the translation
""
""

""
""

""

""
""

""
""

""

""
""
 pero  wait  ha    we really have to meet 
""
""
  oo  yeah   it 's okay
""
  no problem  with me
""
""
 and next time  
""
when we meet next week i  wo  please let 's have it serious because because we 're not going anywhere
""
even right now my mind isn't fixed yet on our real target for this thesis okay
""
so  i 'm just telling you that in advance okay
""
now where were we
""
""
psycho two
""
""
yeah what about psycho two uh yeah the process of the translations and   stuff 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well you see  translation  cough   break in the recording   starts enunciating very clearly, exaggeratedly, mimicking a teacher 
""
well you see  uh in the translation there are so many methods that we might use
""
yeah  ha 
""
paper
""
no oh there are so many methods of translations that we might use
""
now uhm in those methods of translations for example in our case we would be using the bilingual form of translation
""
in essence what would happen here would be we have uh the  tran  we will get the uh copy of uh of the words that we were supposed to translate and we 're going to get the copy of that which is in uh in tagalog or filipino
""
and we 're going to ask a bilingual to translate that into english     okay so for example there 's other words in uh in filipino and then i ask you ma'am may you please translate this in english you 're going to translate this in english
""
now once you have translated it in english we would i would then try to compare how are you able to translate it
""
but
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
compared to the original
""
""
yeah with the original
""
then after doing so i would ask a monolingual not any more a bilingual a monolingual is someone who is really an expert in the in the in vocabulary or in words
""
you got me
""
yes  okay now this monolingual will countercheck
""
""
monolingual in what in in expert in english or   in tagalog 
""
""
 yeah yeah   yeah
""
""
in english
""
 yes yes yes you got it very good
""
now this monolingual will then check the translation that you made okay together with the translation uh  uh together with the english form and try to find out if they are matching okay
""
now whatever the monolingual finds out and whatever you found out from the bilingual will then be uh written down in a form of synthesis
""
""
ahh
""
""
to inform how were you able to check it out and at the same time it is also essential to know uh if uh if the way it was translated was in the proper way or not
""
you got my point
""
""
yes
""
""
  okay 
""
""
 i   see your point
""
it 's very big help  the point
""
""

""
