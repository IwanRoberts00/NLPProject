bullshit that 's 1 word to say no it 's just it is just an expression of mine though i know it 's not right so it is not proper for me ever since we transfer here in metrica i 've learned to mention

life now i 'm not happy with my life  yes i can say that i am contented with my life but i 'm not that happy with my life you know what i mean  there 's still an emptiness within me which i cannot see what it is  words i 'm still searching  but in your condition of course you know what you want as of now i 'm not so sure i 'm not so sure of the future i 'm not so sure of my plans especially especially of all those things that happened with me these past few months you know i envy those people especially my classmates who already have plans after they graduate from college what are their plans what are their plans as usual go into mass media but isn't it such a bore to to plan your life ahead anyway it is good to have definite plans but that will be so dull if you simply if you simply fo follow the pattern of your life of your life that you want it to be then you won't have to   it is much more thrilling but then you went you won't have to get to be worried for the   worried about what  about the future yes if you plan ahead for me it is quite a bore i don't know it 's just that i take life as as it is you know although i have plans for the future it 's just that i don't want those plans to run my my present life because it will ruin me
