sign their attendance and all that when when it 's pay day my boss will come here and ask me to give the pay envelope to the professors things like that and when it 's and when it is isn't it boring well i don't know sometimes i get bored because i stay here whole day and my boss doesn't stay here the whole day he just drops by   so you 're just alone   yeah   in this office   so sometimes   well your office is conducive very cozy and at the same time well thank you i arranged this very good good arrangement i arranged this  what about   courtesy of jing-jing  what about if there are phone calls and then suddenly your boyfriend is there and my boss is behind me   yeah speaker b laughs  would you entertain your boyfriend no i drop the call este i will say like you call me some hours hours uh no call me back after an hour  why   like that  because i cannot talk to him the way the wa the way i want to you don't wanna get intimate with your boyfriend while your boss is listening

doing   uhm  i want to direct plays i want to be in the production uh uhm and uh i think it 's one way of expressing myself yeah that 's why your masteral 's in relation to that well yeah sort of but uh you know i really want to pursue a kind of uh further studies in theater arts theater arts and i think that would be who 'd be your characters what kind of play by the way is that   well it 's uh a typical augustinian presentation uh well you do that every year yeah this is for for three years already for three years same play no different plays of course uh different play because the the play should suit the characters and at the same time it should really touch a kind of issue it should discuss an issue about for example our issue this year is about friendship and community life yeah i 've read it telephone rings   that 's very augustinian  wait oh there 's a telephone call you better answer that hello good morning  who 's on the line break in the recording  she 's looking for whom for my boss fr secio who 's that sister tina sister tina of caloocan uh a teacher here or  no   or just a friend  i don't know okay  it 's the first time   so yeah this coming august twenty-eight we 'll have a presentation i think you have to invite some of your friends also so you 'll not feel bored i won't sharon is here so why would i be bored   yeah sharon also is coming together with her friends i think that becomes a tradition already that uh every time we celebrate the feast of saint augustine we invite our friends from different schools and from dif from other seminaries and we and it 's a kind of socialization you know ve augustinians very friendly yeah like you  am i   you really belong here am i you are laughter  oh thank you do you still notice i have colds yeah actually i 've noticed that two weeks ago laughter  yeah well forget the colds i ju i am very very happy that i am here although i 'm not feeling well i just wanna see you because uh because yesterday i wasn't able to to join you for lunch yeah where have you been where were you yeah i was just very busy doing uh a very important work uh in my room then suddenly i slept i rested for a while then when i woke up it 's already three o'clock you skipped lunch yeah it 's time for prayer when i woke up   you always do that  well sometimes i forget to to take lunch because i 'm too busy but anyway i 'm too fat i 'm big speaker b laughs  and i don't think no that 's not enough reason your size is not enough reason for you to skip lunch you know in an augustinian community we really we really value meal time we should be together we should be eating uh together in the in the refectory and every time i skip dinner lunch or breakfast my brothers would always ask me where have you been why did you not take your uh your dinner why did you not take your lunch i feel so guilty  yeah   yeah   and as i observe ha  when you don't join them for lunch  yeah  but sometimes i can't help it but uh just to sleep just to take a rest kasi  but e every time i do that i ask for an apology especially to my brothers who who kept on asking me about that well that 's part of life  uh-huh  yeah like when you were when you didn't join us for lunch i when i see you in the afternoon i asked you why didn't you join us for lunch well every friday and saturday i 'm out for school and they understand that i have i have to take my lunch outside   yeah   i understand   outside   e la salle is too far from san agustin center of studies so uh i take my lunch outside but mondays through uh wednesday i see to it that uh i   you take your lunch here well laughter i try i always try but you know my work sometimes you fail most of the time and as i observe that as i was saying as i observe when someone is not there for a lunch they look for that 's because you know it 's part of our training that we should go together we should be together that 's very augustinian you know community life we value community life and when somebody is absent of course the fathers always look for the lost sheep   lost sheep uhm yeah you know as the bible says he 's looking for the lost sheep  and so after that father master would always ask the leader oh where is willy oh where is dante where where is uh uh so and so so because break in the recording belong to the community and every time we take our lunch we take our dinner here yeah we talk we discuss anything we discuss issues yeah the things that happened to you the whole day   the whole day yeah fray will i can i ask you a question yeah what did you really want to become when you were a kid when i was you wanted to become a priest well when i was still in the elementary my one of my teachers asked me what my dream as i reme as far as i remember i really wanted to be an economist i don't know why   you love numbers not really numbers i don't know why it sounds so good economist  uhm but later on i realized that i cannot really i couldn't be an economist then later on during my high school days uh i wanted to be a doctor uh yeah laughter  but i 'm but i 'm not good in science uh-huh then uh i also hate numbers so i don't wanna be an engineer but later on i realized that i want to teach i want to be with people then after high school i   what course did you finish by the way bachelor of education i graduated from the philippine normal university  uh that 's good   then i taught for three years after before entering the seminary i taught for three years where in montessori de manila in para&ntilde;aque uh-huh then i really enjoyed teaching then it was the time that i met my co-teachers who were seminarians before then they invited me for a retreat for seminars symposia about religious life then seminarians of saint augustine no uh s v ds they were my former my former co-teachers in montessori oh then they left the seminary and then it was the time that they invited me to to join the same congregation  to join  uh-huh then after that i felt that there was really a calling then the rest is history yeah it seems that you 're interested about my my my vocation  yeah i am i am well i am interested it started there uh i felt that uh god is calling me for a very special purpose then i enjoyed uh attending seminars about religious life i started reading the bible and started uh examining myself i involved myself with contemplation then after that i left my work i asked my superior i wanna enter the seminary then the rest is history as i said yeah so you you entered seminary three years after you graduated from college yes i worked for three years in montessori de manila it was so compensating i really enjoyed my work i was able to meet different kinds of people and up to now they still uh we still have an open communication with my former co-teachers and administrators and words of me but of course god has greater plans for me that 's why yeah that 's why i opted to be a priest well it 's not an option but a kind of calling it 's a kind of vocation that i can't really resist there was one time that you told me you missed kids like that 's why every time my my formators ask me oh willy would you like to teach yeah i always see to it that i accept the offer because i really miss kids one time we were at bi&ntilde;an yeah yeah yeah that was what i was about to say  uh yeah  every time i see these kids running i miss my work i miss my job as a classroom teacher and i wanna go back
