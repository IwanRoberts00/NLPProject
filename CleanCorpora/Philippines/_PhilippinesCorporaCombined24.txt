pala  are you serious yeah so you passed i don't know speaker a yawns  yuck why  oh shall you go i gotta go ris tara  bye bye ris did you see the buzz last sunday uhm not much chuckles   not much  uhm did you see carlos agassi crying  what about it  yeah i saw carlos crying what did you think about his acting he 's so like a boy chuckles   chuckles like a boy you know the problem with him is that he really can't act that 's why the tabloid says uhm that he 's like a rapper when he acts and that 's one big criticism against him i think that 's his field you know to sing to rap but not to   not to act yeah and then they found out that onemig is a best friend of his  and then the reports are saying that he 's going to be replaced by onemig he 's going to be killed in the episode and that 's why i think he 's so pissed about that because he didn't  wha what episode uhm the episode he 's got uh sa dulo ng walang hanggang you know this uh with with uh with claudine barretto   barretto oo with barretto and i think it will be uh it would make a great impact on his finances if he stops in that show you know how much naman they earn yeah sure but why did he cry in the first place well i don't know the problem is there was a question of onemig replacing him but then when boy abunda started questioning him the conversation centered on his past uh yeah i remember about his father the iranian father yeah who used to beat him up daw quote unquote and then he even showed his scar laughs and then the conversation   scar where on his face uh yeah  o di ba on his cheek  oo  and then he he was saying like uh he grew up with the maid and it was an accident but then he wants his father to recognize his abilities and and and the sad the funny thing about it is because the show uh the the interview started with boy abunda asking him so how are you now how are you now chuckles   words he 's ready to cry my god you can see the tears at the corner of his eyes but the one thing that i like in the buzz you know the last time i saw the buzz  what what was that when boy abunda was interviewing pops fernandez uh yeah yeah that was that was nice two two sat two sundays ago yeah when whe when pops fernandez cried yeah i with that interview that was the first time that i empathized sympathized with uh pops yeah because before when he when she ans when she is interviewed i hate her why i uh i cannot see sincerity in her   uh is that right okay   but during that interview with boy abunda the last time just recently i saw that he she was sincere i can understand her now
