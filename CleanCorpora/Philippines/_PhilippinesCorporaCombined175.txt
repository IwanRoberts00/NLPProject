so nadia nadia basically this is uh just an informal interview because the lasallian ambassador group is a big group composed of about sixty plus or about seventy so in based on my uhm three years experience being the coordinator for the ambassadors uhm what happens is they just come and go and sometimes i really don't get to know them personally i only get to know uhm about a handful of them about siguro  uh about half half of the ambassador group personally for the whole year before they leave so what i want to do is uh have better relationship with them quality relationship with them therefore i 'm meeting you uh all personally one by one okay so uhm before we go on with several of my questions could you please introduce yourself to me a little background  god  uhm well i 'm nadia tolentino duque uh right now i 'm a first year b s a student uh i actually come come from liberal arts so it 's c l a then i shifted to accounting uh-uhm so my previous course was ano communication arts business management  then you know with all the requirements for shifting and all of that i was so glad that i was able to pass   and while i was doing the process for shifting i was also applying for lasallian ambassadors that time  so i was so glad  oo   uh-uhm   uh-huh   uh-huh   laughs so many paper work ha  yeah so many paper work then there was the midterms   those stuff and everything  i was glad that first i learned the results from the shifting   that i was able to shift  uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  like we were only four shiftees from uh external shiftees to accounting then only three of us made it to shift to the course  uh-uhm  uh-uhm why why why did you want to shift it 's my interest it 's like during the l-pep during the l-pep i was asking the lasallian ambassador uh how how do you do shifting  that 's what that 's that that was my first question because  uh-huh  was that was that your first choice your first choice yeah it was my first choice but then la salle wasn't my first choice then for a school ahh i see what was your first choice it was u p u p what happened at u p laughs  like everyone so i didn't get in i didn't laughs  okay okay chances are if i passed i 'd probably get 1 word  floating technology there or something so i 'm glad i didn't and right now i 'm here in la salle with ambassadors and everything uh-uhm so then what happened next was that i i was then i shift i was able to shift and then i learned the results from the internet   that i passed then that 's it right now i 'm an irreg = irregular student   i get to meet different people then i 'm glad that i 'm with the ambassadors because once in a while i could say hi to people and  say hi hello   uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  what are your other involvements in school other organizations uh actually i also joined j pia so i was the only communication arts student who was in j pia laughs  in j pia laughs  i really wanted accounting so during the we had this   general assembly  uh-huh  assembly then what happened was that uh people like uh uh introduce yourself so hello i 'm ganyan ganyan b s a i 'm like this b s a then i 'm like i 'm communication arts business management   so parang uh okay so that 's it so i 'm glad i 'm b s a also so i could mingle with them so  laughs so you 're you 're just a plain member in j pia yeah plain member din for tapat  but i 'm inactive inactive why did you join tapat  uh principles i guess i don't know it 's like it 's do you find yourself uh further involved in tapat  's activities hopefully but then i don't know where to start  like right now i my priorities are more in school with the requirements and everything  uh-uhm   uh-uhm secretary interrupts  just let her wait so that 's it i guess laughs  what activities would you like to be involved in tapat  tapat  uh-uhm what what found the what did you find interesting in  tapat  it 's their view of being quite leaning on the left side uh-uhm i don't know i think they have this thing and then during the neat activity they also made this presentation which there were points given that i quite agree on it  uh-uhm  uh-uhm like stude student things like that and   then and sometimes i guess maybe in second year and the third  uh-uhm  uh-uhm and what was your reason for joining the ambassador group the reason why i joined actually for it 's just that i wanted to do something and during my stay in la salle the fact that i was i was already here  then i saw the uhm application dates then actually i wasn't able to pass during the regular time it 's like they extended  that was the time i was able to pass it actually i didn't i didn't quite expect to make it with all the difficult interviews  you know i mean i was so glad that i was able but the reason why i joined because i like to meet people i like to meet uh like ano other students and then what i like what i wrote in my essay i said that i like to give back what i learned or what i experienced during my l pe l-pep which was  uh-uhm   uh-huh   uh-huh   requirements laughs   uh-huh  why what did you experience laughs  it was nice because i got the chance to bond with other people  and then there was then i saw the lasallian ambassadors like fun people because during the last part isn't it there 's a culminating activity for all the ambassadors they were like dancing paikot laughs   so parang wow galing tapos parang  you get to be a teacher for two days  so be the big guy i don't know that 's why i wanted to join  uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  do you think you 'd be good in teaching no laughs  i have a phobia phobia for ano   no laughs  phobia for what because i 'm a student myself and i know like for example  mina barok there 's this teacher who 's from visayas who who has an accent so chances are people would mimic it parang ganon  will try to ano  basically it 's the student relation i don't know if i could ano manage it  uh-uhm uh-uhm  but that 's part of the requirement for bring an ambassador   to have the facility   yeah yeah i know that 's what i want to get over in i mean to learn to learn the uh-uhm and then what else what else are you looking for in an organization probably one of the reasons why you chose the ambassador group something that 's active that that does something   unlike for you know for some professional orgs = organizations  like there you give you just pay the ano for being   a membership fee you have this party then that 's it for the whole year that 's the activity  uh-huh   membership fee  uh-uhm uh-uhm unlike here you get to go to the s p s then you have your own  tambayan those i guess would that 's nice  ano   uh-uhm  how how do you find the ambassador group so far fun we keep on laughing laughs then although  fun uh-huh  have you been with us during our past activities the  salu-salo   yeah words  have you attended some of the campus tours orientation uh there was a campus tour yesterday but my first class was one o'clock so i just  yes   missing words the catanduanes group didn't you you weren't able to join that what 's that we also had a campus tour for a group of students   from the state college in catanduanes  uh i was  uh no not yet so this is the first activity that you were able to join was the  salu-salo sa 2 words  yeah then the turn-over  yes and the turn-over so aside from them being fun they 're ano confident  imagine to handle all those people  they 're confident  people who you don't know yeah and then it 's only you it 's only you then those stuff parang it tak takes a lot of guts i mean parang the ambassadors itself it 's hard with all the interviews the things you have to do and then you have to act you have to do this i remember there was this question during the interview   ba't bilog ang manhole   parang they asked me that chuckles   ha i don't know and then there was also another question like how come the sheep in baa baa black sheep is ano black   parang bakit black ang sheep  sa baa baa black sheep   parang kasi it 's for kids so kids usually use uh  ano same letters sings baa baa black sheep so it 's supposed to be all letter b or they make all sorts of suggestions what if there was never a lamb parang there was there was never a sheep throughout history what would be the animal like  parang  you know the reason for that what was the reason for asking those questions no they just wanted ano get you a card  and then they asked that in between several serious questions   right  right so  so they they were just trying you on whether you and i kept on answering   you kept on answering laughs  the first thing that comes to my mind i answer it because it 's but they also made me shout in on the top of a chair  screaming darna pretending that there was fire how how did you find the screening it was hard before the screening i was actually planning to not take it anymore because i 've i 've heard from the other people who 've done it their their term was katay  uh-huh   uh-huh  what  katay   katay what do you mean by  katay   parang you have to go through  talagang super hirap because for other for other i think organizations just like ones the ones the ambassadors is like one of the hardest i don't know for for them  oo oo   uh i see  because we want to get the best laughs   yeah of course  oo we only get the best and the most confident because if you don't have the basic skills to start off with   we 'll be having a difficult time  training you   yeah   yeah   training them di ba  yes at least we have to have the basics the foregrounder which we could work on like what what are like we we we would like to have people at least a certain level of confidence already because if from the very start they 're already shy we 'll be having a difficult time training them we only have a short time to train them before l-pep  well actually on the way uh you 'll be more enhanced in terms of uh being confident and having the skills  but we want to have at least something to work on  so with the people we have right now at least we 're confident that we got uh that well the cream of the crop laughs the best    so you 're one of the best all right uh we see that all of you have potential uh   how however uh we would like to make you better so therefore we 'll be requiring you to attend all the trainings right now you 've been accepted as an ambassador   however you have to earn the title  you have to earn the title of being an ambassador for completing all the requirements meaning the trainings the meetings because uhm in our experience there have been several students who applied and then  but after that they weren't able to attend several   training sessions which is unfair because some of them uhm well almost all of them went through with all the training sessions and i think it 's very important that for you to be able to be a good ambassador you 'll have to have the skills and to be knowledgeable of whatever things that we 're supposed to do  uh which are   shy   yeah   uh-huh   uh for the   thank you that 's nice  thank you   so   but then   trainings  uh so what 's the training all about uh it 's all about the skills that you have to give for being an ambassador how to be diplomatic  ahh game setting  uh aside from that how to be diplomatic how to facilitate  effective presentation skills how to be more confident what is the proper way of dealing with guests uh the do 's and don'ts of being with guests uhm what else events management is also part of it because i also delegate projects to ambassadors for them to handle and then i what i do is just supervise because this is a preparation for uhm what do you call this your profession after you graduate you 'll be asked to handle projects you 'll be asked to uh talk in front of people you 'll be asked to uh what do you call this speak in front of a big group so i think that 's what uh we value in terms of skill more on public relations so we hope we could what do you call this we could create more confident public relations people for the university uhm with the ambassadors  uh   uh yeah   uh words   pero it 's nice that we 're called ambassadors  compared to before orientors  yes  orientors because the orientors only just work for l-pep  during the freshmen during the freshman orientation  for l-pep   pero it 's tedious during before the l-pep yes chuckles it 's tedious before and during l-pep and a little after probably especially for the logistics group
