 magandang hapon din sa inyo
""
alam n'yo naman kaming mga pulitiko gusto namin ang ini-introduce kami
""
tuwang-tuwa kami diyan
""
pero mabuti na lang maikli ang introduction ni ano 
""
let me tell you however the story of the best introduction ever made of me anywhere in the world
""
i was introduced by gary lising the comedian
""
and this is how he introduced me in rotary
""
he said ladies and gentlemen please i 'm very pleased to welcome the best congressman congressman  pa ako noon  the best congressman in the philippines today
""
he is probably the best congressman in asia and maybe he is the best congressman in the whole world
""
and then he said someday he will be president of the philippines probably president of asia and maybe of the whole world  laughter 
""
and then gary lising said ladies and gentlemen please welcome congressman bagatsing  laughter 
""
so  'nung tumindig po ako sabi ko naman sa kanila  on behalf of congressman bagatsing i regret to inform you that he cannot come today
""
but he asked me to give his best regards his highest esteem and admiration to the best comedian in the philippines
""
he is probably the best comedian in asia and maybe the whole world  mr joey de leon  laughter   clapping 
""
i want to thank you for the opportunity of explaining the issue on death penalty
""
and talking of opportunities it reminds me of one of the brothers of de la salle
""
you know a long time ago i attended a conference in one of these big hotels and the theme of the conference was written in the wall and it said there are no problems there are only opportunities
""
but one of the de la salle brothers came down complaining and he was saying  he was saying to the reception girl i have a problem with my room
""
and the girl pointed to the big sign there are no problems there are only opportunities
""
and the brother said i don't care what you call it but there is a woman in my room and i don't know whether it is a problem or an opportunity  laughter 
""
anyway about the death penalty  maybe towards the end of our discussion you should give me your feedback on what you think should be done about the death penalty
""
the discussion you see on death penalty is one of those debates where every side is correct
""
it is a debate where you can argue like in the middle ages where they were arguing how many angels can stand on the head of a pin
""
in this debate in my view everybody is correct
""
it becomes therefore a policy choice
""
and that is where judgment and presumably wisdom is called for
""
the debate you may be familiar with is basically of two sides
""
you see we lawyers are very familiar with two sides because that 's what we do for a living presenting one side of case
""
we all know that there are always two sides to the question and the third side is probably correct
""
and that is the determination of the judge
""
but in the policy debate on the death penalty the two dies are presented basically in this manner
""
one and this is supported by the catholic church argues that life is sacred
""
and therefore there is nothing that can be done to take our you must not encourage the taking away of life
""
we must preserve life and protect life because it is unique
""
it is the best creation of the lord and therefore there is no compelling reason for now to take away the life even of criminals
""
this is one position and it is correct it is correct
""
there is nothing more sacred than human life
""
all through eternity every single man and woman in this room was created uniquely
""
there will be nobody else fortunately or unfortunately like you
""
and therefore whatever uniqueness you may have whatever qualities and combinations of talents you may have must be preserved and must be made to bloom
""
there seems to be no compelling reason to take away to snuff out that life
""
assume that there is a criminal
""
assume that the crime committed was heinous by whatever definition of the of the constitution
""
assume it was something that was unconscionable
""
is there good reason to take away human life
""
the side that protects human life insists no because it does not deter
""
there is no reason you must always have hope that that human life will improve itself that that person will improve his spirituality and that person can still contribute something to the rest of humanity
""
the arguments of course in favor of death says it will deter it is a deterrent to crime
""
in other words right now with so many kidnappings with so much crime in the streets with so much killing even by men in uniform there is good reason to put the fear of the lord into the hearts of criminals
""
and therefore we must re-impose the death penalty 
""
in the constitutional commission when they were discussing this it was now congressman teodulo  teo  uhm natividad who argued for the protection of human life
""
and he said that there is nothing even death does not deter crime
""
and he used the example that has been written about in fact in several articles recently of the middle ages when hanging was the penalty for a crime of pickpockets
""
if you were a pickpocket and you got you got caught and you got convicted then you would be given hanging as the sentence
""
you would be hanged to death
""
during the hangings however it attracted many many people because people like the gruesome people like the spectacle of seeing these persons hanging by the neck and uh moving about until they die
""
and when there were people the pickpockets were very busy picking pockets  'no 
""
and that was the argument he said
""
you see death was the penalty for the crime of picking pockets
""
when the crime was being imposed the pickpockets were very busy
""
and therefore the penalty of death did not deter the pickpockets
""
that argument in many different forms has been uh presented by different people 
""
the senators who believe for instance in fighting uh or using all the resources of government to fight the drug menace insist however that the fear of death will deter
""
and maybe uh that expectation can be reasonably based
""
we do see a lot of disrespect for law
""
we don't see fear of the enforcement of the law and therefore one can argue that if we make the penalty more stringent then the fear that can be instilled in the hearts of the people who are potential criminals may deter them from committing crime
""
fundamentally that is the debate
""
in the senate the report of the committee of joey lina and it was also reported out by the committee on justice which i chair recommended actually death penalty or  reclusion perpetua  as the penalty for various crimes
""
you may be familiar with why the senate has to or why congress has to come up with a recommendation on penalties for certain crimes
""
the constitution abolished death penalty
""
the philippine constitution of nineteen eighty-seven removed death penalty from the statute books
""
and in lieu thereof said something like  except when for compelling reasons congress shall impose death penalty on heinous crimes 
""
the issue therefore became what are the heinous crimes
""
and that is why the solution of both the house of representatives and the senate is to mention the following which shall be considered heinous crimes and therefore they should be subjected to capital punishment
""
except that the definition of the committee on revision of laws of capital punishment only amounts to  reclusion perpetua 
""
for those among you who may have some uh nodding acquaintance with penal law  reclusion perpetua  means thirty years imprisonment
""
there are those who argue that that is a harder penalty and that should be a more fearsome penalty than death because death for whatever it is worth solves all your problems
""
according to rizal death at least gives you rest
""
so maybe death is the excuse uh for some people uh involuntarily terminating their human existence
""
the report of the committee recommends  reclusion perpetua  or  uh life imprisonment up to thirty years
""
you see there is really no life imprisonment
""
even in some instances you may remember having read the graft and corruption cases in the  sandiganbayan  and they convict uhm only the small ones
""
this guy stole  seven  seventeen thousand twelve thousand four thousand from the public works
""
so he was convicted with nine hundred years imprisonment because there was three years for seventeen thousand ten years for so many so he had all of nine hundred years on the theory that it 's the first one hundred years that is difficult
""
so nine hundred years but never they never really impose or they never serve nine hundred years
""
there is in the first place the physical limitation of being unable to last for nine hundred years
""
but all these long and lengthy sentences only amount really to thirty years imprisonment
""
the lina report says it is thirty years non-commutable and cannot be shortened
""
and that is the option that the lina committee is recommending
""
the herrera position however and this is shared by many in the senate suggests that we should impose death especially for drug pushers  especially for those who commit the heinous crimes of rape with murder and and  sev  fourteen other crimes that are enumerated
""
in the house of representatives they have enumerated eighteen crimes that can be subjected to death as a penalty
""
the tragedy there is that in the original penal law there were only twelve crimes subjected to death penalty
""
now we are going overboard
""
we are going to the other extreme and we want to impose death practically even on traffic violations
""
and that is wrong
""
during the time of the late lamented president marcos there was a time he raised all the penalties to death 
""
he issued varying degrees in fact uh decrees in the these were the decrees that we brought to the supreme court and we questioned whether they could be issued even by the lawmaker who had no limits to his power
""
we argued that lawmaking has limitations of reason
""
lawmaking has limitations built on nature uh on the law of nature
""
but he issued decrees like eighteen thirty-six and eighteen thirty-seven
""
and one of these decrees increased all the penalties of crimes against public order to death
""
and what were these crimes
""
never mind the great disorder  chum  uh uhm demonstrations  etcetera 
""
but one of the crimes was if you were singing at night in a disorderly fashion that is a crime against public order
""
that is what they called  charivari 
""
and under the decrees of marcos charivari would have been subjected to death   'no 
""
i mentioned that because some of you may be fond of singing at night  laughter  on the belief that you know how to sing
""
and you should appreciate then how fortunate you are that you live under these conditions when the presidential decrees no longer apply
""
now those are the two extremes of the debate
""
in the house of representatives i voted against the imposition of the death penalty precisely because of the belief in human rights and in the value of human life
""
once though in la salle greenhills there was a conference of eight hundred street children
""
these were aged twelve to sixteen street children from cubao street children from quezon city
""
the street children you see is one of the sorriest episodes in the life of the filipino
""
you see the young by nature are protected by their parents or by their ascendants
""
the young have always been protected even the puppies are protected by the bitch
""
there there is no other word for it
""
the kittens are protected by the cats
""
the birds the the chicks of the birds they are protected by their mother bird
""
i don't know what you call them  'no  but the young
""
but in the philippines today in cubao alone there are three hundred thousand homeless children
""
their parents are not protecting them
""
if you ever are in the circle theater near the circle theater there is a pizza parlor in one of the corners if you eat in the pizza parlor and you look at the tunnel through which the uh water passes you will see at night probably forty kids age twelve maybe lower sleeping in that small tunnel
""
and it is what they call their home
""
it is therefore against almost uh the law of nature that we have homeless who are so young and have made the street have appropriated the street as their home
""
what was the  plea of the children
""
in that conference in la salle greenhills they broke up the eight hundred or so children into i think ten workshops
""
and they invited uh five congressmen in the generic sense there were two congressmen and three senators invited to listen to their reports
""
and every single workshop requested for one thing among others they also asked for schools they asked for homes  etcetera 
""
but there was unanimity in the request of one
""
they said could you please impose the death penalty on men in uniform who use us
""
