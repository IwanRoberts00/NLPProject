you girls actually read this stuff i mean look at this the boyfriend clinic what 's with it i don't know i mean looking at the 1 word   i 've been going out with this guy for four weeks but he barely acts like my boyfriend  like we say in the parlance of the industry this is so much tsu-tsu  i mean laughter i mean look at this i mean what 's the basis for this stuff yeah actually yeah like this one i love my boyfriend but i can't stop thinking about this other guy laughter  why it 's common occurrence nowadays really laughter  yeah it 's because you 're not i 'm not human no not that it 's because you 're a guy  rea you know that is one reason why there is so much strife in the world when people start thinking of us like oh you 're a guy you won't understand i mean hello that 's true it 's basically true no no no no no there may be differences between people but when people communicate and they try to have this mind set that they can understand each other that will at least solve the problem even if the person can't exactly i mean i don't have to be i don't have to have gone through the holocaust to know how it feels to be what inside the pans and burners  no pans and burners uh i mean you haven't been put inside one of those burners right the ones in auschwitz uh uhm but you have an idea how it feels how it would feel   uh uhm uh uhm  precisely my point uh okay you don't have to be i mean instead of looking at these things i think girls and guys should just talk talk more i don't know like talk more relate more like like this is she your type speaker a laughs  what what 's wrong with it you know that 's what i meant by in saying that it 's probably the reason why most girls have such a skewed perception of me i mean where is the basis for this stuff what 's the where 's personal experiences where 's the but that 's anecdote have you seen an actual research an actual research  in actual research there are two types of evidence there 's one where you can actually cross reference it through studies like like when you put up a bibliography of stuff like the books you read that you actually do a research with all of those protocols and things and there 's anecdotal evidence this is anecdotal evidence it 's pretty subjective which means it 's subjective it 's not an objective data like if you say something like i don't know i guess i just hate it when people try to box you like this one i mean but sometimes it depends on the person reading uh too much plato on my part laughter  no not really because sometimes women just want to read about stuff like this yeah to read stuff like that but aside from that to have in to have an inter-connection with another woman uh uhm to relate per personal situations uh uhm to someone whom she thinks will understand her so this is a girl thing yeah i mean basically a girl thing i mean the nearest male counterpart of this is playboy laughter  uh no  laughter what there are guy magazines like this  no  no well f h m is one but not seventeen it 's for teens no no no i mean di ba i mean this is what seventeen magazine i 'm speaking as a com major i would know the rationale behind this magazine the title itself speaks the rationale it 's seventeen it 's for teeners   it 's for the teeners  look at look at the topics get kikay hair and make-up word sex and body laughter   oo nga 'no  i forgot what 's with it i mean what 's with it i don't know no no no i 'm just thinking along the lines of one of it 's my catholic upbringing i 'm so sorry laughter  of course i 'm  you don't like that mag and try that one uhm it 's cosmopolitan i think it 's worse laughter  worse it 's not worse it only shows you the latest fashion trends the the latest make-up trends six daring moves for single girls it 's just the title if you 'll browse and read it sex for virgins  that 's that 's yes those wet those starved sexy flying secret well yes no i 'm talking   well  i 'm talking like i don't understand this stuff but i actually do i mean i wanna be chief analyst of the words  but you 're just being human am i forgetting that i 'm not human laughter  no it 's not that it 's just that it 's just that the topics they tackle in those magazines are very very what   normal  yeah in a way but not all and maybe i don't know i guess i 'm still coming from the gestalt i have in reading the republic i mean in the republic in the have you read the republic plato 's republic  some part not all in plato 's republic plato actually chastises homer plato or socrates or plato he chastises homer it 's about saying that homer teaches the wrong stuff to the greeks and that 's why they have a sucky state it 's just like saying why our people are afraid of dying it 's because homer and some of his contemporaries portrayed death as something bad like when you die you go to hades and all this shit happens to you so if i was a warrior if it was my job to defend the republic the state so why would i throw my life away if dying would be so bad where 's the hon stutter look at it 'cause for some there 's glory in dying for your country but that that 's plato 's point that 's not common because the one that they 're exposed to sensitizes their mind for that particular gestalt   in their minds dying is bad meaning it 's not it 's not even if you die a glorious death battle this is remember we 're talking about the greeks we 're not talking about  uh uhm  okay the norse we 're not even talking about christians  okay  we 're talking about a gestalt in which when you die you go to hell or rather to hades and when you 're there nothing 's fun there  uh uhm  i mean look at greek the greek cosmology am i correct with that one yeah the greek but why do they portray hades as a place wherein there are two divisions well that 's according to the hercules movies the starworld movies  homer   don't don't base it on that well well according to that well according to that there 's these two divisions one is if you die a normal cause or if you did something good in your life you 'll be in in a place like paradise this is hercules duri  hercules journey the disney hercules no hercules the series starworld asia of course they 're going to show that it 's called mass media appeal no that 's what that 's the problem nowadays in mass media like this one i guess the reason why i said plato 's republic and all others it 's more like this i mean or maybe i 'm just too much the guardian but anyway like like i said a while ago life is more than just sex it 's more than just getting an orgy chuckle more than just well i agree with that yes but life is more than sex life is more than life is more than life itself but gail you are one of the leaders you 're conditioned for doing stuff that 's more than this  yes you may   yeah but still i 'm a female and i well yes but what i 'm saying is but you see this is a we live in a machoist society speaker a laughs  there are speakin' there are spoken rules regulation on our society that females should abide to  uh uhm  uh uhm right uh uhm i mean why do women wear high stiletto heels do you have to abide by them  well if you were if you 're a flight stewardess you 're expected to be beautiful to be glamorous to wear red lipsticks and brown eyeshadows peach blush-ons and everything the whole stuff uhm the way that women weren't were expected to not vote and not hold say positions such as lawyers politicians and  uhm i guess what i 'm just trying to say is uh the reason why i can understand stuff like this like cosmopolitan magazine heck they they provide jobs don't they yeah they do i don't know i guess   they 'll also show you where where the best where you can buy things at the lowest price i guess that was just something like   and  i mean i guess if it was just about a question of trends i mean this is good i mean stuff like this it probably chalk it up to dialectics where when thesis and anti-thesis meet in order to come up with a synthesis where i don't know maybe i 'm just too much ivory tower coming from where i came from laughter  you know how the atenean thinks sometimes what about if atenean girls read the same things hahaha laughter i think   uh uhm   right   yeah some even read what y m  i guess  i guess i get your point about the thing don't tell me you haven't read the male magazines no i haven't oh come on i 'm a catholic youth leader how dare you   hello  yes i haven't really yeah i find them repugnant   ows okay i mean have you seen any of those male magazines uh no no no we 're not talking about playboy we 're talking about the male variant what f y m   are we talking about  everything playboy the   if we 're talking about playboy those other stuffs they   the f y m the what i find them repugnant have you seen any of the pictures in those magazines i 've seen the pictures and they no not suck suck suck is such a bad term to use right now in that context laughter  oh i 'm not ignorant laughter  oh okay yes if you could insert kissing sounds here laughter  yeah right yeah right yes gail why are you going the other way laughter  gail don't go there laughter  anyway uhm i guess i 'm just angry at th at the thought that most people sometimes you tend to believe what the leftists say about current society because of the stuff you see like the media and even the church tries to keep people 's minds down so they don't rise up against the bourgeois laughter  like what the traditional politicians say right now not exactly mo like the trapos traditional politicians more like well like this instead of teaching people to reach beyond mere animal stuff it 's actually trying to emphasize you 're sleepy no not you 're just tired uhm the baby is tired no i 'm not hello i 'm not a baby anymore  laughter  yes you 're twenty-one anyway where were we yeah something like that it 's i don't know i guess it 's my upbringing i mean my upbringing was more like teaching me that i 'm this that i 'm i can be more than what most people are chuckle  yeah i was brought up to believe in that and in the inherent good within humanity in the potential for humanity so i guess seeing stuff like this trying to keep you in the animal level it 's just like it 's just sad uhm uh uhm that 's what plato was trying to say in his republic  it 's that 's part of what he was trying to say like it should be that education education should be about trying to teach people to reach their highest potential not just give them all the shit of data and that 's it or just trying to make them run through a system wherein they 're just trying to develop people in order to perpetuate the system we call them shicogen in among sci-fi buffs  shicogens salary men uh uhm wage slaves uh uhm people who are slaves of the bundy putring imitating sound of bundy clock  uh okay okay   i mean how many graduates can honestly chart their own course i mean i i guess i 'm lucky i 'm an atenean i mean heck i haven't i sometimes i have the right to choose my own job chuckle  but how many people can do that i mean how many people when they graduate just have to take this job because it 's the one being offered why is it like that why is the educational system like that if you graduate from a reputable and known school you easily you can easily get jobs
