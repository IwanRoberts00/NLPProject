 beginning of speech not captured because speaker did not
use the microphone  and the regular polymer that you see around okay
""
why you can look at it you can feel it you can touch it but don't
turn it  laughter  
""
now there was a bit of uneasy concern on my part when i was
requested to give a talk about the role of polymers in the environment
""
but after hearing some of the speeches and reading articles on
polymers i thought that this talk would be timely enough so as to clear a lot
of biases that most people have about polymers in general and plastic in
particular
""
now as a polymer  now as a scientist we usually measure progress
in terms of technology and the amount of innovation we introduce
""
and on the other hand as an environmentalist we would like to use
these innovations and technology in order to better  if not maintain a
balance between polymers and the environment
""
now the main concern or one of the main questions we would like to
answer at the end of this talk is have we maintained a balance between
polymer technology and  environment
""
or are we tilting the scale way towards technology
""
if so are we trying to do something in order to bring back the
balance between polymers technology and innovation and the environment
""
so hopefully at the end of the talk you 'll be enlightened enough
and you can answer that question 
""
now as i 've mentioned before polymers at present has affected our
day-to-day activities
""
most of the conveniences that we enjoy now are due to polymers
""
if we refer back to this century as the atomic age then the next
generation can aptly be called as the polymer generation since by that time
each and every facet of our lives will be influenced by polymers
""
now it is a sad fact though that students get out of the university
with having the barest knowledge of polymers
""
now this same indifference can be seen even during the early
beginnings of polymers
""
it was in eighteen thirty-nine when the goodyear  bo 
brothers charles and nelson transformed natural rubber and vulcanized it and
formed as a formed a more thermoset material that we use now
""
and one of the products that is being used uh that came out of this
innovation is the  eno  ebonite which is used as bowling balls
""
now we have tires automobile tires
""
and after goodyear 's inventions and even before world war first
polymers were considered more of an art and an empirical formula rather than
a science
""
so in the field of polymer science art precedes more than or
precedes that of the science
""
for almost a century polymers had been used and commercialized but
it was only after forty years when polymers were taken seriously and
developed as a science
""
it was also  do  during those last forty years that polymers
experienced a tremendous growth in science and technology
""
one of the  one of the forebears of polymers science is
staudinger
""
now  sto  staudinger laid the groundwork towards an
groundwork of polymer as a science and at the time that he was working on on
the concept of science he was advised by his colleague and i quote 
dear colleague leave the concept of large molecules well alone there can be
no such thing as a molecule as a macro molecule 
""
now getting this kind of of letter or advice from your peers is a
big turndown especially in the field of science
""
but in the year nineteen twenty staudinger was able to demonstrate
that natural and synthetic polymers are not aggregates like colloids or
cyclic compounds like cyclohexane but are long chain-like molecules with
characteristic and groups
""
now staudinger went on to win a nobel prize
""
now what are polymers then and what makes them different and unique
from regular compounds
""
now i brought some visual aids in here 
""
now according to composition we can classify polymers either as
addition polymers   okay 
""
now i pick a necklace bead in here and addition polymers okay are
made up of the same kind of beads same sizes all throughout
""
now polymers can range in length it could be short  like this or
it can be real long 
""
now you can  you can form longer monomer polymers if you want
by connecting one specific  polymer to another polymer as what i 'm doing
right now 
""
okay 
""
so you can have one polymer chain and mix it this one up with
another polymer chain and form longer and longer polymer chain
""
now you can make a lot of structures out of this
""
in fact one of the common inventions that are being done right now
or what we call the structural polymers you can make stars out of them 
 laughter 
""
okay
""
now you can make ladder polymers out of them
""
it looks like a ladder 
""
okay
""
here we go it 's not perfect but it looks like a ladder
""
and you can make comb-like polymers out of them
""
you can make all the structures you want to make out of polymers
""
now there 's another kind of polymer which you can observe
""
take a look at this
""
now you have different sizes of the bead
""
we have small sizes this is the big one  words 
""
now this kind of polymers can also be made
""
now here 's a more uniform kind of polymer
""
we have an alternating small big and small beads in here
""
and this is another kind of addition polymers
""
now condensation polymers are those polymers you prepare using two
different kinds of monomers
""
so if i have this purple one and i mix it with the yellow one then
we end up with what you call condensation polymers
""
now what is the importance of using addition and condensation
polymers
""
now it depends upon the end use
""
so polymers in general are prepared in order to satisfy the
consumers
""
now according to structure okay according to structure we can
classify polymers into three different kinds
""
we can have the elastomers or rubber okay
""
this is what came out from natural rubber
""
it 's it 's not so sturdy you can break it you stretch it a little
bit and you break it
""
what goodyear did was vulcanize this and form a little bit more
strong rubber
""
now another one  now some of the examples of  polymers we
 okay 
""
i mentioned earlier elastomers and the natural rubber for the
chemist
""
they are otherwise known as the  word 
""
now we have neoprene which is polychlorophene they are used for
automobile parts
""
now we have  word  in rubber or known as
 word  s and  word  s is the one that
you use for automobile tires
""
now we have polydimethoxyethylene that 's our silicon rubber
""
and silicon rubber are the one used for biochemical or for purposes
because for purposes of uh biological parts because silicon is biologically
compatible so heart valves okay ahm  contact lenses are example of poly uh
xylene
""
now we also have polyalkaline sulfide otherwise known as xylopol
and chlorosulfinated polyethylene or hypalon
""
now for fibers you can have cotton wool and silk which are
synthetic fibers
""
and the first uh these are  word  or natural
fibers
""
and the first synthetic fiber we have is nylon six-six
""
now this was uh synthetically prepared i think in the year nineteen
thirty-six pretty close and we have polyethylene dacron and acetate rayon
""
now the last three have played a very important role especially in
the aerospace industry 
""
okay all of you have seen this one okay you 've seen a picture of a
spaceman walking in the on the moon and  wearing a heavy suit
""
now this suit is made up of reinforced nylon composites
""
and what they put in there is are what  word  we
have alkylated uh polyethylene and the purpose of that is you don't want it
to get burned okay
""
now they 're made up of different layers and rather uncomfortable
""
what they 're trying to do right now is to move towards polymers
which are lightweight and and examples of these are what we call the acetates
or the polyacetates
""
okay now here 's your uh space mobile okay
""
and  you have very few metallic parts in here most of the metal
parts that you see in there are just used to hold the structure together
""
now most of them are made up of again reinforced composite light
polyurethane and also  words 
""
now you can see an aluminum foil uh covering out of this
""
this is the module where uh  where this where this is the module
where the scientists live okay
""
this is where they live during the space exploration
""
and as you can see it 's not very convenient or tight packed in
there you can have only about five of them
""
the maximum is five if you have more of them then it will be very
uncomfortable okay 
""
now this is uh this is the cabin where similar to the one that i 've
shown you the first time and you can see that you have the mobile arm in
there
""
the mobile arm is the white one that comes out and this is where
all the astronauts go through so it 's way way up in there it 's so small and
all of them are made up of reinforced uh composites or polymers
""
now here is another picture of the mobile space mobile that i 've
shown you before
""
and okay all of these are placed inside your spacecraft and if you
look at the spacecraft they look like rubbery in form yes simply because they 're
really made up of reinforced rubber again in different layers 
""
and this is when you scrape off the  out  the outer layer of
the spacecraft
""
you you scrape it off and look at what is in there
""
you can see that it 's made up of plexiglass and plexiglass is one
of the more common structural materials we have
""
urethane is another one 
""
now  one of the innovation of polymer is computer okay
""
without polymers there won't be any computers
""
and as you can see this is the kennedy space center with all the
 com  computers installed in there and what they do is monitor space
exploration and every time they have airplanes or not airplanes spacecraft
being sent in space 
""
okay
""
now the third third kind of polymer is the most visible kind and
those are the plastics
""
and the plastics are made up of polyethylene and under this we
have the low density polyethylene the one that you use for packaging
""
this is an example of a low density polyethylene okay
""
now the high density polyethylene are the one that you use for
milk and juice bottles
""
and the linear low density polyethylene are also used for
packaging
""
now it 's  mo  the linear the l l d p e are sturdier than
the linear poly  dens  low density polyethylene
""
so we increase the tensile strength of the polymer by increasing
the or varying the proportion of these polyethylene uh polymers
""
now polystyrene is what you normally see every time you buy
something from fast foods so you could go to mcdonald or wendy 's now you
have those uh we call them expanded polystyrene and those are made up uh by
simply getting your basic polystyrene and  try  trying to inject
gaseous substances into it
""
now polyethylene terepthalate are what you see inside the bottles
""
there was a time that most of the drinks we have are in in bottles
okay
""
those are easy to recycle but we 're shifting a little bit now
into plastic and that is when you have  poly  polyethylene
terepthalate uh being used more often
""
now the cover that they use for the soda bottle is made up of high
density polyethylene
""
now if you come across the structure uh which is  glass-like
okay it looks like plastic but it 's a little bit more glass-like that is
polymethyl methacrylate okay or otherwise we know as plexiglass or fiberglass
as what you mentioned
""
now polyvinyl chloride is another polymer which is being used for
packaging
""
and polyoxymethylene is a polymer which is used for gaskets okay
""
so all of the polymers under plastic in there you 'll find out
that polyethylene polystyrene polymethylene terepthalate are the one actually
that is our main concern 
""
the visibility of plastics as a consumer item  and the
misconceived notion that we can do nothing to get rid of plastic safely has
made plastic subject to inordinate amount of attention and legislation
""
the alternatives given range from either recycling to outright ban
of plastic packaging
""
people 's biases towards plastic has subjected polymers as a whole
under critical scrutiny
""
in nineteen seventy-six the united nations met in france and
formally introduced a new concept in resource management and environmental
control
""
now this no-nonsense front end approach to environmental control
involves minimizing resource input and effluent output even to the extent of
revamping and redesigning industrial processes and products
""
now for quite some time  this was met with indifference and
branded to be impractical expensive and idealistic
