doesnt look like a labrador  sigh no not not quite why and he ano parang his teeth are sharp the teeth are sharp yeah  di ba labs their teeth are like dull not really no but if you if they nick you you 're not exactly you know bleeding or anything oh oh oh what does he look like i mean describe his head   words gonna look like a lab the dog 's trainer vanderbilt 's trainer thinks that she 's a lab  o and then but alam mo 'yung she has these  topak moments yeah  na she suddenly just lunges at you as in ferocious ha   talaga  yeah  strange   labs dont do that oh then you should meet lancelot  ha  you should meet my dog why lancelot oh  'yon pure breed 'yon   di ba i mean they 're they 're not like that i 've been looking for a mate i 've been telling you  hay naku  it 's so hard to it 's so hard to find a word  for my dog  ay naku you know what what uhm not mate-wise ha pero i found the best vet ever where mandaluyong where in mandaluyong ah you know what i cant remember exactly where but what 's the word mandaluyong what 's the name of the ano  the name of the vet is doggie land doggie land yes and you know what as in when guggenheim was like really bad we brought him lang to our vet here in the village  oo  and talagang i really felt so bad it was so strange ha because our whole family was sick including guggen what ás in jason was sick i was sick why karen was sick why the maid the cook wasnt feeling well  o  and guggenheim was sick as in the whole family and then we brought him to the vet  o   pina-confine namin kasi high fever oh my god  o and then so when i was feeling better  pssst  my dogs are barking oh i heard i hear i was feeling better na and then guggen all  parang he was deteriorating  baka naman he 's old now how old is guggenheim well he 's only what seven eight   pssst only what he 's like seven years old that 's old no but by dog barking word live to like thirteen well yeah eleven to thirteen  di ba  yeah so we brought him uh we moved him out of my vet because i was so dissatisfied and i brought him to this doggie land nga   o   wow alam mo 'yung when you watch on animal planet  yeah in the it 's really like that vet well  ganon  maybe i should go there as in they have complete with pure oxygen for your dog  talaga  they intubated him really pure oxygen they gave him all sorts of you know uh drugs to help you know stabilize him they gave him a cold drip because high fever he had high fever uh-huh they gave him sponge parang 'yung ice bath yeah as in  galing   talagang galing galing  so what what was he sick with you know they they told us that i can hear karen yeah it seems like kidney failure  ay my god did you give him ano he had pedigree before did you give him pedigree we gave him pedigree before  ay you know i 'm scared na  because i gave my dog also that e  yeah and apparently before that that scare nga with pedigree came out there were already dogs who were dying because of kidney failure yeah 'yun na nga  i 'm scared na e  yeah dont dont na  no i i i stopped na after pero  he 's had like you know one or two sacks already oh and eto ha  what the vet said was it 's very difficult to diagnose so just keep your eyes open for 'yung symptoms  oo  parang guggen had the symptoms we just didnt know like he 's always thirsty always thirsty always thirsty oh my dog 's not always thirsty the and parang they lose their their desire to play well no well not my dog yet  'yung oh no no not not not lose their desire but the their tolerance for activity exercise gets diminished  talaga  yeah so look out for that oh no and and oh my god he had those oh no  pero ang yung kay guggen what was really strange pa about it was the night before he got sick  oo  he was jumping around yeah yeah like  oh no   word  well i 've been wanting to ano i 've been wanting to have my dog checked but my my vet naman said you know it 's not really that ano naman it wasnt that uhm what do you call that they 're not sure of that really uh-uhm that it it that the food was really causing the ano and like you know my my vet was like you know uh the the shots that you like the anti-rabies di ba  yeah distemper whatever yung ganon apparently there are other injections that my dog wasnt getting yeah yeah like what like there 's this thing for the gleptospiro  leptospirosis yeah yeah yeah there 's a shot for that why not who 's what what 's that vet doing i dont know what what my vet has that my vet 's incredible that 's so sad this this little woman who who can like stick her hands inside the dog 's mouth  oo  oh my god no as in i was shocked he was giving he was giving lancelot ano what do you call that yung heart guard  oo  or or yung and and yung for  de for deworming and stuff like that  yes yes  so she she gets she gets the tablet breaks it into into little pieces  oo okay and slams it down you know lancelot 's throat as in like oh my god wont he bite you  then then she said it depends on the dog she doesnt do that for pitbulls and dobermans yeah dobermen chuckle dobermans  ayun   hay sobra kaming depressed when ano  when that happened as in  oo  i cried so you have a new dog not yet i 'll give
