explain it for me peer pressure is uhm getting influenced by your friends it 's like when your friends try to tell you to do this or that and you think that it really isn't right it 's like you since they are your friends you go along with the flow and you just you just do what they say so uhm they they won't be able to tell you that you are chicken or something i think i think i also feel the same way about it uhm i think that peer pressure is very very common common now i mean e each every every any person goes through this you know and it 's just like yeah your friends telling you to do something that you 're not sure of doing but you end up doing it and then later you regret doing it it 's usually that 's usually the case for a any person any student  yeah  so uh do you do you have any experiences that can be related to to this topic 'cause i do but you first   yeah  i asked you first okay i have i have some actually many but i 'll just state one like there was this time when it was our lunch break i wait at wendy 's and speaker clears throat one of my friends just spurted out that what if we cut class and we watch this movie i thi i heard it 's nice then speaker clears throat all of sudden uhm each one of us gave in and except except one of my friend i think uhm the pressure really was on my friend because uhm she really didn't want to cut class because she besides that she liked that class she never cut class in her life so uhm there the pressure was there and at the end uhm she was able to control herself so she really didn't give in but we did and after watching that movie we really felt so guilty all of us felt so guilty because after that when we went to our next class they told us that we had a test in that class that 's why we really regretted what we did how about you i have this friend who always cuts i mean me i don't really like the feeling of cutting classes   cutting class  yeah uhm one time uhm we i ha we we were gonna have this test this long test but you know i wasn't able to study for it so i was thinking if if i should just not go to class since you did not study for it  yes  yeah since i didn't study for it then my my cl all along my class my classmate was also thinking of the same thing yeah so i wasn't really considering that that o considering cutting class but then my friend forced me into it she she she forced me to do it  so we en yeah laughter   did you  we ended up cutting class then the next the next meet the next meeting uhm i found out that that the test was really easy  meeting   oh shit   it was open notes so i really regretted doing it but then uhm our our teacher gave me another chance and you know he gave me the same test  the same kind of test  yeah  so it was really easy  it was okay   yeah it 's good that it 's good that your teacher gave you the same kind of test laughter   yeah  i mean uh i wonder what why do you think these things happen to us i mean why   how friends pressure us too much yeah it 's maybe because uhm it really depends on us if if we are that uh weak not that really weak but if we really give in at once to our friends 'cause sometimes uhm even though we know that this thing is not right we still do it for the sake of our friends since uhm we stay together then and if we don't go with them they might say things about us but that 's not the nice part of it we really should have our own principles  how about you i think yeah it depends on the person and you know sometimes i think if if if peer if there wasn't peer pressure life would be boring boring so boring   i yeah laughter  i mean i i i believe that it 's so easy to do the the wrong thing rather than doing the right thing 'cause it 's more exciting  yes   yeah laughter  there and uhm oh why why do you why do you think your your friends pressure you why why i mean why do they yeah i don't know maybe chuckle maybe  they just want to some   they just want to do it yeah they just want to be with you yeah uh yeah   that 's it  they wanna do something different or if they wanna do something bad they want someone to be with them yeah because   so that it sh it 's so that the blame yeah the the blame would be on all of you yeah and not only on that person yeah i think that 's it how do you feel after being pressured after if i if i really liked what i did uhm laughter of course i enjoyed doing it but after when i think about it i really feel guilty but what can i do i did it already so there 's nothing i can do me it really depends on on what i did of course i i feel bad but then i think of the the excitement i felt when i experienced that certain thing  yeah laughter  'cause sometimes you do something that you know it really isn't right but you really enjoyed doing it  yeah   especially if you 're with your friends yeah and i have this one but then i had this one experience i cut class and then   for what  uhm to watch a movie speaker b laughs the same with you then we had fun but when i got home i really felt bad and i yeah i told myself that i 'd never cut but still i i  you do it  i sometimes sometimes laughter  still cut there uhm these things like peer peer pressure usually leads to bad things really major majorly bad things like uhm preg pre-marital sex  yeah   yeah  yeah you know also also drugs and a lot a lot more things yeah and can you imagine i mean if you were if you got pregnant at an early age  yeah i really can't   what will happen to your future yeah i really i really don't get how how some teenagers uhm especially in the states uhm have sex like under eighteen like yeah and they even they even think it 's normal for them and if you if you don't if if you 're not a virgin anymore you 're you 're not in   you 're not in  you 're not a part of the the the the really popular people in in school  yeah  i i really don't get the point yeah it 's yeah you 're right there and you know sex is something that you really should do uhm at the right age at the right time when you 're married when you 're stable in life when you really have when you planned everything else out you know it just it just shouldn't be like oh let 's do it tonight so our friends would laughter our friends would think we 're cool like like that laughter  yeah i also think so i mean sex is nothing it 's not like something you just   it 's not like everything  yeah it 's not like something that you just have and you can just give it away yeah laughter  i mean virginity is not like that it 's really something sacred   sacred yeah yeah i i i also believe in that i mean it would be better for a person to to have sex when she 's already with someone and she is already married not i i mean not not even not even extra marital yeah affairs but you know with someone who she really loves it 's nothing that it 's it 's not it 's not something that you just give it away it 's it 's   yeah it 's nothing to brag about yeah it 's it 's just it 's something 's yeah that 's what they say it 's something sacred it 's really some   well i i hate guys who who think of sex as everything they think of sex as their life you know yeah like yeah yeah laughter you know some some people when when they think they love a person they think that uhm when they have sex with each other  it will make the relationship more strong i i really don't think that that 's true 'cause if you love a person uhm you can wait for each other you know if your love is really uhm pure and honest how sex is not sex is nothing yeah it is it is yeah i i believe in that also i mean some guys ay most of the guys they even look for sex first  yeah   they don't even think of even if they don't love the person they just wanna do it with that person i mean i believe it 's really lust it 's not love love anymore it 's not love yeah it really isn't love yeah break in the recording  what do you think about you know people who just get into drugs they just you know they get they get influenced to do drugs they get pressured by their friends with to do drugs that 's really yeah a really blame   yeah yeah yeah   thing i don't know for me i mean how can you not control yourself and what 's with the drugs what can it what what good can it do for you yeah what good can it do to you i mean you get what you get insane you get high your your nerve cells break down   yeah  get destroyed yeah decrease in number yeah and you get your your your it 's like you kill yourself uhm faster if you do drugs i don i also don't get it why people do drugs maybe yeah i know it 's certainly because of peer pressure but why do they still do it if they know that uhm a lot a lot of people really die because of drugs  yeah  and their life gets so ruined   miserable  yeah get really terrib it 's terrible i mean people just end up you know in the streets  yeah  uhm doing nothing instead of them working they just do drugs like the rugby boys under the bridges  yeah and   yeah you know i really every time most of the time we pass by that bridge i don't know what bridge that is anyway under the bridge i can see a lot of young boys uhm  i think those doing doing that that those stuff you know i think those boys do drugs i mean specifically rugby 'cause they have so many problems and you know they don't have money to to buy food and they 're really hungry so they just you know they just do drugs to forget forget their hunger forget their problems   problems  but still i mean they can   they 're not excused  yeah it 's no excuse i mean they can they can look for a job they 're not they 're not disabled  yeah  i mean imagine disabled people they 're disabled they 're they they like one one person one disabled person lacks a hand but still that person you know wor would work if if he or she had a chance yeah i you know uhm but maybe because those young young boys uhm do do those drugs because they don't have money but still it 's no excuse on why why why they should do it they could look they could look for jobs even though they 're uneducated like uhm there are a lot of programs in the government that give jobs to those uhm not only poor boys all people all poor people yeah but what about those rich kids kids i mean they they all they have all the money to buy drugs i mean but still they don't even uhm you know they don't   yeah   engage in those stuff they shouldn't they shouldn't engage in those stuff  i mean they have their future ahead of them
