uh the title of my lecture is the same title of the book that uh isabel read in the introduction
""
unfortunately that book is not available in the philippines however those of you who are interested in uh reading in greater detail what i 'll be talking about there 's a uh filipino version uh it 's in english but this is the philippine edition of the book and it can be obtained in u p  'no 
""
uh i 'm also not going to lecture i 'm going to try to make this a little bit more informal okay
""
uhm i will be talking to you about the results of a study we conducted a couple of years back about the cognitive consequences of literacy and i 'd like to uh acknowledge the cooperation of my research associates uhm mariano santo domingo who is uh with the u p diliman and uh edith lianne pe&ntilde;a who is now a graduate  stude 
""
what we were trying to study well the motivation for doing this study was to look at the effects of literacy  pa  particularly non-formal literacy programs in marginal communities in the philippines
""
by  marginal  i mean these are economically disadvantaged communities usually found in the very far-flung areas very remote from the urban areas
""
uh and the the  communi  there there are several such communities in the philippines and for the study we selected five within the luzon area and these are uh of different uh types of communities meaning some were agricultural some were uh fishing communities some were urban poor communities and so on
""
and what we wanted to look at was basically what was the effect of having non-formal literacy programs these are usually adult literacy programs on the way the people in these communities think about their lives think about their livelihood and think about the world
""
it was originally intended to be a case study although uhm my my training in uh cognitive science uh predisposes me to more experimental and quasi-experimental approaches
 somehow the study evolved to become a quasi-experimental study involving more more cut-and-dried variables so to speak
""
what we ended up actually trying to answer was the following question
""
i apologize it turns out the it 's probably not going to be very clear  referring to powerpoint presentation 
""
uhm it says there what are the effects of literacy acquisition on thinking processes
""
this is a very broad question you know it can be answered in many different ways but what we wanted to find out was when one becomes literate what happens to the way he or she thinks
""
now this question has actually been addressed by many many different other researchers mostly people who study literacy people in uh who study cognition in literacy in particular because some people have argued that literacy has an effect in changing the way we represent information about the world
""
i i 'll talk about this uh in a while
""
uh there 're many many different versions of that proposition and an important distinction we have to make is between the so-called direct and indirect effects of literacy on the way people think
""
when we say there is a direct effect the actual process of acquiring literacy in and of itself transforms the way you look at the world
""
uh a very  im  the most popular version of this is proposed by uh maybe bruner is familiar to you uh cole early on was saying talking about things like this
 the idea was that shifting from the oral to the written mode of representing information allows the mind now to become more flexible in terms of handling the information
""
just think about it
""
if there is no printed word everything we have to know has to be stored in memory and the there will be a greater primacy on oral information and if you think about it in old civilizations those with uh no  litera  literary tradition most of the uh most complex forms of information were stored in things like narratives uh songs  'no  long ballads epic ballads and so on
""
these were not all almost always they were not written down and they were passed on from generation to generation by actual uh rehearsal and practice and actual experience
""
it 's not something that they put in stones so to speak and put in a library  'no 
""
on the other hand when things started coming to print it achieves ideas start having some degree of permanency
""
you fixed it on paper and what that does is it frees up according to some theoreticians it frees up what we call cognitive capacity or your cognitive resources
""
suddenly the ideas don't have to be here all the time they can be on paper and so your mind can do other things
""
so that 's the direct hypothesis that the act of acquiring literacy and ability to represent information on print in print rather allows the mind to start operating in different ways
""
there are indirect ways by which literacy can also affect the mind and uh simply there are this means that literacy first affects something else and then that something else affects the way you think so uh it may be that literacy for example changes the way people live
""
literacy might change the way information is uh handled by a community
""
and that doesn't necessarily require uh uh a direct transformation in the way people think but because there are important transformations in the way the community now handles information people come to think of information in different ways as well
""
so you see this effect of literacy on thinking is more mediated and uh we all wanted to find out whether literacy does have a direct or indirect or maybe both effects on the way people think
""
uhm this was an important question to answer particularly since we 're looking at marginalized communities because in these communities literacy practices were uh to use a more uh recent term were not yet  technologized 
""
they were not yet institutionalized in the communities uhm and you can even say that literacy practices were marginalized in most of these communities
 as you would expect in these communities literacy rates were low but there were literate people in these communities
""
there were even high school college graduates in these communities but you can imagine that uh in these communities literacy is not the most important thing to have in order to survive and succeed in that community
""
in fact most of in some of the communities those who were highly literate worked outside the community because there were no opportunities to capitalize on their literacy skills within the community themselves
""
i will give you a little bit more description on the communities in a little while
""
what we tried to do uh what what we did to answer this question was uh we looked at the communities and found participants who were either illiterate or literate
""
uh we also looked at people who acquired literacy using two different modes those who acquired it through the formal educational system and those who acquired it through non-formal education uh programs  'no 
""
so that was a very broad category
""
uh they might have participated in non-formal livelihood  cum  literacy education programs a lot of which were sponsored by decs the b n f e in that area
""
in fact all of the areas we looked at there was a bureau of non-formal education  literac  adult literacy program which was tied up with uh a livelihood program
""
others acquired their literacy skills on their own by reading comics
""
uhm those who acquired literacy formally you we the cut-off was they must have been in formal education at least until grade six because previous research shows that if there 's reversion to illiteracy it 's usually around grade four or grade five
""
so we felt that making grade six as the cut-off was the was quite safe
""
uhm the the non-literates or the illiterates were those who did not acquire literacy uh and we usually relied on self-reports and they a uh key informant in the community to determine this
""
if you 're concerned uh uhm just linking it to dr davis 's paper a while ago we did not uh we used a very low level definition of literacy here
""
we were not defining literacy in terms of functional or higher level literacy it was really being able to uh process printed words okay
""
uhm you might be worried that uh about whether we were sure whether the participants were actually literate or not
""
uh you know especially illiteracy is not something we would feel comfortable uh  ad  uh talking about but surprisingly the people in these communities were not that apprehensive about saying whether they could read or write or not  'no 
""
we only had maybe two or three cases where the participants claimed to be literate but actually were not and uh we were able to find out because of the key informants  'no 
""
in these communities everyone knows everyone else okay
""
uhm aside from well the idea was we were going to compare how the literates and the non-literates would perform in certain cognitive tasks to find out whether literacy does make a difference or not okay
""
we also i said i mentioned we looked at the mode of literacy acquisition a very important variable that uh we looked at
 something we were not thinking of looking at initially was the degree of literacy integration in the community
""
others would call this the the extent to which literacy was technologized in the community
""
the idea here is that each community integrates literacy practice to varying degrees
""
you can imagine metro manila is a very literate community  'no 
""
almost everything we do involves some form of literacy practices you know uh when we go uh go shopping in the supermarket we have to read labels we have to be able to find out what are the prices of uh things
""
we have to be able to read signs
""
we have to fill out forms you know taxes you have to be able to read to fill complete tax forms
 almost everything we do requires reading in metro manila well for most people
""
but imagine uh an agricultural community or a fishing community where most people have to deal with the elements of nature to earn a living
""
uh people don't regularly read newspapers
""
if they do it will be tabloids  'no 
""
uh it 's not an integral part of what people do  'no 
""
parents don't usually read to their children
""
uhm if at all children will only be required to read in school if at all there are books available
""
uhm so you can imagine there are there 's a variance to the degree to which literary practices are important in a community
""
all of the communities we studied were relatively low in terms of degree of literacy integration
""
that is in none of the communities do we find the same degree of sophistication or technologization of literacy
""
if you don't like the word  technologize  i will stop using it just tell me
""
it 's easy to read but it 's hard to say
""
uhm i will describe this variable in greater length when i talk about the communities
""
finally we wanted to look at the range of cognitive processes uh conceptual understanding conceptual organization reasoning explanation
""
the first three were  al  have always been implicated in studies looking at thinking and the mind
""
in particular because the hypothesis the literacy hypothesis is always stated that literacy allows people to come to achieve more formal and abstract levels of thinking
""
and this is most manifest in conceptual thinking that 's conceptual understanding conceptual organization and abstract reasoning
""
that 's why we looked at these things okay
""
you will see get a flavor of that in a while
""
the communities we looked at uhm are as follows
""
there 's this community in uh kiangan ifugao
""
the s i l has done a lot of work at kiangan
""
in particular we  loo  focused on a  barangay  uh  barangay  nagakadan uh which we say calling it a  barangay  for  so  those of you who are based in urban communities  chuckle   mi  you might think it 's like a small thing but a  barangay  in kiangan is several mountains you know uh so it 's like actually quite encompassing
""
uh it has a very low literacy rate
""
uh unique to this community was the fact that we only got illiterates and formal literates there were no non-formal literates in this community
""
