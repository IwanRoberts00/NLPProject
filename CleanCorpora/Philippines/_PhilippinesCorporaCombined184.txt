ceremony before that uh malaca&ntilde;ang has been saying that her speech today is going to be short and simple her speech last year was around forty-five or fifty minutes long uh in that speech she outlined her thirty-five promises and uh out of the thirty-five there are some groups that say twenty-two promises were uh delivered by the president and her administration her cabinet uh word the the word is is that the president is going to make new promises in this new speech uh but focus on very few things uh peace and order uh being one of them uh power rates is another thing that the president is going to focus on that probably being the closest to issue to the hearts of the people at this time we we 're going to await the entrance of the president into the hall in the meantime we still have dr abueva and prof romero with us in the studio break in recording  jing at this moment uh president gloria macapagal-arroyo is still closeted in one of the offices here at the batasang pambansa  building with senate president franklin drilon speaker of the house jose joe de venecia the secretary-general of the house uh these personalities had met her earlier when she arrived here at

focusing very strongly and emphasizing very strongly on the need to strengthen the republic she will be talking about a strong republic that will be the theme of her sona this year this historic batasang pambansa building has been witness to a very colorful political history of this country we all know that uh this was inaugurated in nineteen seventy-eight uh with the interim batasang pambansa calling it home uh many have said that it was actually a rubber-stamp parliament uh by uh of ferdinand marcos former president that parliament was elected in nineteen seventy-eight  the interim  pia  yes jing pia i 'm going to ask you to take off your hat as an as an anchor and our co-host this afternoon and put on your hat as a subject matter expert uh politically while everyone is excited about what the president is going to say today and we all know what the reactions are going to be in the days to come uh but the focus will be on politically what 's happening at the senate because a lot of things are hinged on that critical numbers game in the senate now that the majority uh has the numbers what do you expect to happen uh down the line well jing uh we can always say na the senate uh the administration has the majority now in the senate but let 's not forget it 's a very slim majority uh it 's thirteen eleven  so ang lamang lang ng administration sa  opposition ay isa lang so  napakaliit na na na linya yan ano jing  yeah   uh huh   clapping in the background the president now in the lobby of the batasang pambansa building she 's in a mustard orange uh suit beside her is senator loren legarda in a muslim-inspired attire a while ago uh the first gentleman mike arroyo was being escorted into the batasang pambansa session hall by uh mrs gina de venecia the wife of the speaker and with the first gentleman were the children of the president luli mikey and dato jing as you were saying yes a very slim majority in the senate it 's not something exactly to be comfortable about i suppose that the administration will have to get more senators on their side from the opposition the president uh going down the newly the the session hall as we can see it 's a brand new carpet brand new ceiling brand new walls and uh the refurbishment has cost the house of representatives seven point five million pesos the president there being greeted by members of the

lot of people also have been saying the same thing about what they expect about the president peace and order power rates uh jobs uh on top of a whole list of things that they expect the president to

she made in her sona last year uh there was one thing that stood out in that whole long list of accomplishments where she said that apart from unilab no other medicine company was giving or selling

said applauded seventy-four times uhm was there anything new was there any issue that was new in the speech other different from the speech that she delivered last year   in terms of focus  well uhm  jing uh appa uh actually last year yung  sona niya also had a lot to do with fight against corruption maintaining peace and order the fight against crime uh in a way masasabi natin jing na medyo hindi rin nagbago yung mga sinasabi ng pangulo dahil uh sinabi na nga niya paulit-ulit no na kailangang pag-igtingin pa itong kampanya laban sa krimen laban sa terorismo at sa iba pang mga problema ng uh ng bansa  although she did what made it different in a sense was that she kept hammering on the theme of a strong republic and how important it is to be able to put this strong republic together building it stone by stone so that we have one one full edifice jing
