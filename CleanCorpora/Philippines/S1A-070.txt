""
""
you 're like my friend  didn't want video also
""
""
i feel it 's pointless at this point to have a video maybe later
""
""
or at least if ever  you know
""
""
photos  na lang 
""
""
or somebody you know like you don't have to pay for the person who will take the video
""
""

""
but i had no problem with her because you know tina she 's really  went around for me and went to the places you know the type no like i feel no stress with my florist
""
but the photographer we went there to  ano  to glizas so expensive my god
""
okay for the the thing we wanted to get we were looking at it without uhm video coverage huh it costs twenty-five thousand   okay 
""
""

""
""
twenty-five thousand for fourteen rolls of film
""
it 's fourteen rolls of film and one black and white an album of course only uhm one hundred loose three-r okay and uhm imported frame
""
we told them remove the imported frame   you know  we don't need that
""

""
we had them quoted we had them quote
""
""
 yeah  
""
the same package
""
""
something like that
""
""
yeah
""
""
for genesis although the the shots are less  'no      they only have eight rolls   uhm of film  but they 're giving us for the album about eighty  eighty five-r about five by seven
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
 uh-huh  
""
uh-huh yeah
""
""

""
""
uh-huh
""
""
they 're giving us two hundred forty
""
""
three
""
""
three-r loose
""
glizas one hundred
""
they 're charging eleven thousand
""
""
wow
""
""
and that 's that 's even meng that 's even with  video
""
""
oh
""
""
oh
""
""
but you 've seen the sample of both
""
""
uhm uh glizas i 've seen
""
the genesis
""
""
is it good
""
""
yeah because they took the debut of caloy 's sister
""
""
which one genesis
""
""
yes so they already know they 've worked with vicson
""
""
 e  but you know will the church allow
""
""
i called already
""
""
and
""
""
they 'll just have to take some seminar
""
""
uh okay
""
""
and just make sure they follow everything to the letter
""
""
uh yeah
""
""
because
""
""
maybe the problem is they don't want   disruption in the liturgical service 
""
""
 yes exactly   exactly that 's what they don't want so
""
and i wanna tell them you know like just respect the wishes of the church because like there are apparently there are a lot of outfits that have been banned because   they they took  the seminar and they still broke the different rules and  sayang  i mean it 's a nice church
""
people would be getting married there
""
""
 because yeah  
""
a lot of people are considering that church already
""
""
yeah
""
""
it looks kinda expensive  laughter 
""
""
yes it is it is
""
""
but yeah then again for a church and you know uhm i think if you 're spending too much for a reception
""
""
might as well have a nice church
""
""
yeah
""
""
really
""
""
compared to the reception place that is practically so much less
""
""
yes
""
""
what about your invitation are you having it printed
""
""
i found  na 
""
yeah v- craft
""
""
uh yeah that 's good that 's a good  but it 's kinda expensive  ha 
""
""
uh a little bit but it falls within our budget
""
""
uh that 's good
""
""
we were really planning to spend like twenty we 're spending we 're spending only eighteen
""
that 's no problem no problem
""
""
what about uhm what else
""
the souvenirs you 're making it right
""
""
yeah
""
it 's so expensive to get married
""
i swear it 's so expensive
""
""
how much have you reached already
""
you 're in the five hundred
""
""
four hundred
""
""
oh my god  laughter 
""
""
i know
""
when i when when we were talking about it we 're computing it over the phone
""
""

""
""
he was computing he was telling me ces four hundred one four hundred two the type
""
""
yeah
""
""

""
""

""
""
oh my gosh
""

""
""
uh no no
""
everything 's there already
""
""
you join us  naman o   laughter 
""
""
 hanggang anong oras ka 
""
""
seven thirty why  bakit bakit 
""
""
 wala lang 
""
""
you join us
""
""
 bakit 
""
""
we 're running out of things to talk about
""
""
 uy kaninong  envelope  'to 
""
""
hey that 's mine
""
""
 ay 
""
""
but you have to speak in english  for camille 's class
""
""
 bakit 
""
""
that 's not counted
""
""
why  speakers a and b talk in visaya 
""
 'yun lang alam ko e 
""
""
i told my mom that one  na  you 're  mak  you 're telling me that you 're making  kwento  that thing that statement  na ka dugay sa manila  visayan utterances   and my mom is  sobrang  laughing
""
because you know  di ba  it 's something they would say can imagine it coming out
""
""
yeah
""
  several visayan utterances 
""
""
so you mean your gowns are not
""
""
no everything actually has been basically mapped out for the  ano  i mean we 're just  wai  we 're just working  kasi  with you know suppositions
""
""
uh okay
""
""
right now especially for the gowns we 're working with suppositions
""
""
uh you haven't quoted
""
""
what are you doing the recording for
""
""
for camille and rica 's class in linguistics i think
""
i heard your phone   parang  i heard your phone toot-toot  laughter 
""
""
toot-toot
""
""
toot-toot a while ago  laughs 
""
uh so these are all your ball ball park figures
""
""
yes yes but little by little  ba  it 's going down little by little
""
""
uh so you project it to go down
""
  not exactly 
""
""
 yeah actually   in the beginning we projected low okay
""
so after that we decided  o sige di bale na  let 's make it big  na lang       bahala na 
""
""
 yeah  
""
so  ho  what 's your guest list like
""
""
argh
""
""
how many people
""
""
my god don't ask
""
""
that 's why you 're asking if you can still fit more
""
""
yes
""
""
because your guest  lit  guest list is growing
""
""

and like even caloy 's mom when she calls she is given a different number
""
""
in hyatt
""
""
in hyatt so i
""
""
but it 's basically within the same range
""
""
yes so i just wanna  ano  i just
""
""
no i think you know the the highest number that they can give you that 's how much they can fit
""
""
they can
""
""
fit into the room
