so we move to another topic okay we finished uh testing significant difference of two groups of three groups 'no okay so the the final the final uh part of the of elesta two elementary statistics two is about correlation so what do you mean by correlation  yes albert  relationship okay what else diana what do you mean by correlation   words anything unclear response of a student  it 's okay uh salvador the relation between two groups relation between two groups  anything else  what is meant by the term correlation  common condition or yes pardon me common condition common condition  excuse me so in elesta one elementary statistics one you studied uh correlation and what was the type of correlation you studied  what type of correlation did you study in elesta one pearson product moment pearson product moment  when we have pearson product moment what are we trying to determine in terms of relationship how do you know it 's gonna be pearson product moment  unclear response by a student  when do you use pearson product moment correlation jason pass pass okay arnold pass i didn't study that you didn't study this why unclear response by a student  uh rafael what is what is uh being related when you use pearson product moment  oh jerry  elesta one it 's still in elesta one it 's not even elesta two  pearson r yeah pearson r  when did you use pearson r yes to determine the agreement between two variables  to determine the agreement between two variables to determine the agreement between two variables agreement is it agreement  agreement may i may i see who did not take up pearson  how come you didn't take up pearson in elesta one unclear responses by the students  who was your teacher  unclear responses by the students mr cordero and also mr alonzo  stat one o one  yes  yes marni miss words cordero uhm mr words  yeah i remember yeah yeah he went to taiwan i remember okay you 're excused from not knowing miss 'yong pearson word a at saka b again again a at saka b a at saka b okay  okay so it seems that you didn't take up pearson product moment correlation 'no  not really that extensive between the sum the sum of the of the what the sum of the products of x and y tama  don't give me the formula don't give me the formula i only want to know the concept okay don't give me the formula okay so let 's uh let us words   miss miss is that the exact word is that a the exact words yeah this is taken supposedly in elesta one that 's why we assume when you go to elesta two you know this very well okay so the pearson product moment correlation for those who just uh had a casual casual uh introduction to it okay pearson product moment correlation is used when you want to determine the relationship okay the same term that you were giving the relationship between two two variables which are expressed in interval or ratio scale  okay so the prerequisite here is that the type of scale that you have is either interval or ratio usually in psych =psychology you have uh test scores test scores now the size of a correlation coefficient ranges from negative one to positive one okay  okay it 's negative one to positive one so any value that you get which is more than one that means your answer is wrong what does it mean when you have a negative one to a positive one word  okay we have a graph  this is the y axis and the x axis when it 's negative it means that the higher the y the lower the x  so that 's the relationship between the variables the higher the y the lower the x  when it 's positive okay the two of them increase the same way as x increases y increases so the line is straight okay clear now if you graph the two scores the x and the y okay and you can't seem to draw a straight to draw a straight line uh either in this direction or in this direction okay this may indicate that there is a zero correlation that means there 's no relationship between the two variables so a negative one and a positive one is you have such a straight line this only happens theoretically okay what usually happens is that you can draw a straight line forcing it 'no but the points do not exactly fall there but somewhere close that 's why you can form a straight line there but not exactly passing through all the points okay now when it 's like that you can have a moderately negative  it 's moderate negative 'no okay this one 's clearly negative so this means that somehow it 's negative but it 's not perfect 'cause if you have a perfect one it would be uh the line would be very straight this way but we don't usually have that same way with the positive we don't have a clear straight line writes on the board always there with some points falling there okay so of course when you have a zero words that means there 's nothing there 's no relationship at all between the two variables so what makes this a zero are the scattered dots the scattered dots okay how do we describe a correlation coefficient okay the answer to the pearson product moment correlation is a correlation coefficient usually when we have point three to point seventy-nine it 's moderate writes on the board  below point three that means below point three or point twenty-nine below point eighty and above high  okay okay so the coefficient describes the degree of relationship between the two variables okay so when we hit a point eighty this means that the lines are pretty are quite it 's pretty much this way that means the dots the y and the x meet almost in a straight line okay but not yet perfect because we only get a straight line when we words  now if it is moderate that means many points are outside that line and if it 's zero we are words  okay question question  no more okay were you taught how to compute it in elesta one okay now pearson product moment correlation is one of the easiest one of the easiest you should know that by now okay one of the easiest type of correlation easiest okay what other correlation uh types of correlation did you study in elesta one  spearman okay spearman  okay what else  pi  yeah but you have words what else point-biserial some of the other students answer in chorus and their voices are inaudible  point point biserial point  ano 'yong point biserial so is this all yes we agree students respond in chorus   kasali sa test 'yan miss no no way  no way there 'll be another set that 's why you 're not gonna take this i was told i was told by mr cordero and ms bernardo that words   so wala na si pearson there will be another set another set with fancier names with nicer names okay class now that you know something about it 'no okay there should be something that you know about it okay  miss walang pearson  okay so since you 've taken up the basics already okay whether or not you got uh you got a full lecture from mr cordero or not but he told me you took it okay so now we proceed with different types of correlation okay you will notice these types of correlation were used essentially when the variables are interval or ratio okay so the variables may be initially interval or ratio and then converted to ordinal okay now we go to another set of correlations okay which hopefully you will find useful as you when you write your thesis  okay so what 's the first type of correlation that we 're gonna take up okay the first type would be the cramer  okay cramer cramer coefficient so what 's cramer   cramer is used when you have two nominal variables  two nominal variables so what 's an example of nominal variable  telephone numbers telephone numbers  sex sex and then  what 's an example of nominal frequency type of variables unclear answer  i d number okay oh for example you count the number of males and females in this class that 's nominal  twenty and then five you count the number of freshmen sophomores juniors seniors in this class that 's also  nominal nominal okay so all you have are frequencies okay now there are times that you want to correlate two variables which are expressed in this manner okay obviously you can't use pearson anymore you can't use spearman anymore so you use cramer  cramer coefficient okay what 's cramer coefficient the formula is writes the formula on the board  okay by now you 're familiar with the with the big letter x squared this is the chi chi okay so when you use cramer coefficient you have to compute chi -square words  you 've got to compute chi -square okay so what else  so l here will be the minimum number of rows and columns rows and columns  miss anong word tayo  it can be two by three three by three students say something unclear  so how do you test the significance okay obviously you look at appendix c  so degrees of freedom would be r minus one r meaning rows okay k 's we mean column so they use uh they use the symbol k it 's really c you want c it 's okay r minus one and c minus one  minimum number of rows and columns minimum number of rows and columns for example  so you have uh two by three right two by three contingency table you have a two by three contingency table it means that what 's l what 's l  two how many how many rows do we have  three  how many rows do we have  two  which one 's the smaller one  two  two that 's l  uh okay how difficult this is r equals two whichever is the smallest number that 's l okay it seldom happens to be two because if it 's two you have to use phi coefficient so if it 's more than two it 's uh it 's not a two by two table you use uh cramer 's  miss but you can always fix that kung kapareho na  yes whichever is the smallest one  miss kung pareho  they you it cannot be the same because the phi coefficient is used word two by two  three by three three by no it 's seldom the set up  words it 's still three by three whatever is the smallest number  ma'am pa'no kung one whatever is the smallest number that 's it okay where is the two by two usually it 's lopsided okay  get it   yes miss do we need chi -square for the formula yeah you have to compute chi -square first okay so the chi -square here of course this time you know it by heart we hope you have to compute chi -square first chi -square okay are you  how many should we have in chi -square part two no this is uh you just need uh you just need uh  to show word  you need to you need to determine expected the way we do it here you have to compute expected first  so we have to look what kind of chi -square a student sneezes  there 's no need obviously it 's not a test of goodness of fit it 's not all you need automatic every time you see uh this it 's always always always okay but let 's take an example 'yan break in the recording  if you have this data okay we assume that these are organizations student organizations in la salle there are about six okay then we try to find out whether there 's a correlation between year level and uh year level and uhm participation in student organizations let 's put freshmen  okay you want to find the relationship between membership in student organizations and the year level is there a correlation between the two okay so let 's use chi -square first teacher walks and writes on the board while students talk  okay to compute your students talk  okay do it now  you solve it you solve it genevieve correct students talk  okay break in the recording  okay student organizations affiliations student organizations and level uh year level of students of de la salle okay so since we need a chi -square so what was the first thing that uh we should have done with it students answer in chorus  okay get the expected okay so what are the chances uh computed the expected already right so forty-nine the first the first column will be forty-nine the first row rather will be forty-nine  okay so you see here the expected already 'no like this time from forty-nine times twenty-two divided by one hundred forty-four is seven plus forty-nine so we need to do it for all the cells here okay all the cells all so after computing e for each uh cell then you add it all up you should get an answer between seventy-five point zero nine to seventy-five point twenty-five okay
