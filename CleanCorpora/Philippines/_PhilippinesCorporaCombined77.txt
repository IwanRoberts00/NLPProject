uhm i just wish our finals is over yeah at least for me i 'll only have one day one more finals  one day oh yeah although i have two tests for that day well it 's better than having it two days  uhm so what 's the last movie that you 've seen you know i haven't watched movies for almost uh i don't know three or four years chuckle  please you were still in high school when you last watched a movie yeah oh the last movie i watched was jurassic that was a long time ago yeah i know i rather watch v c r oh uh what is what was the last one uh that you saw mr bean the ultimate disaster movie that 's nice i find it very funny yeah i like that movie too what 's your favorite scene uhm let me see there were there were a lot of good scenes but i guess the one when he 's when he was pretending to like goup the stairs and go down uh yeah yeah yeah when he was stutter he was just in his room but some of the scenes are kind of green right the jokes are somewhat green yeah and gross too yeah and you know i i find it very gross when mr bean you know word chuckle that uh yeah that was gross chuckle  it got all the blood still he ate it  yeah but it was really funny how was he able to fix the picture what picture i mean you know uh the the whistler 's mmother uh he got this poster of of the painting uh it 's a poster and uh yeah and then he sneaked up right uh yeah yeah and then he like glued the poster with an egg white yeah  with an egg white  yeah  some bubble gum with with what bubble gum uh yeah bubble gum   he was eating bubble gum yeah chuckle it was kind of funny but it was ano it was nice at least he got off the hook yeah yeah yeah yeah i thought he was going to show the you know the painting with with you know drawing yeah with his drawing  you see when when he uh put it uh what do you call it when he raises his thumbs up yeah thumbs up it was nice although it was not his thumb that he raised uh it 's his middle finger   middle finger stupid uh it 's so noisy yeah is that the l r t yeah that 's the l r t uhm uhm i i 'm trying to write a story what what do you want to hear it sure sure sure although it 's a little morbid morbid yeah you like morbid yeah oh there 's this guy in the first scene there 's this guy and there 's this girl uh-huh uh the girl is like the mistress of the guy so they were in this hotel room and they were doing something you know   oh yeah dirty-minded huh hihihi no and uhm they didn't know that they were being ano they were under surveillance surveillance by uhm what like a private investigator oh and so they were being taped so there was this camera hidden somewhere in the room uh-huh and uhm afterwards like after some days the guy went to the house of his wife aw 'cause it was their anniversary and uhm she liked to cook uh dinner for them uh uhm and they 're supposed to eat together so for their anniversary yeah so he 's there and his wife was very nice to him and gave him the wine and everything the food uh uhm and after he ate he felt groggy dizzy and yeah he was ab he was able to sleep right then and there his wife poisoned him no no it 's not poison it 's like uh marcos 's sleeping pills or something so when he woke up he he found himself tied to like a furniture or furniture a heavy chair or a i 'm not sure i haven't gone into the details yet but it 's like a a heavy piece of furniture uh-huh and he was bound there sitting on the floor uh-huh and he his arms were tied behind the leg of the chair or whatever it was and his feet were bound together too uh uhm and then uh his wife was talking to him and as it turned out the wife already knew that he was having an affair oh and so uhm the wife wheeled in uhm a t v what t v television oh yeah and uh like a v c r and they played and the wife played a tape  oh   and in the tape where you know well the it was the surveillance tape so uh the guy saw himself and his girl his mistress and the hotel room and everything uh uhm and so after that uhm the wife was kind of mad but he was calm uh she was calm yeah and she said that since it was their anniversary she has a gift for the guy so she brought out this box and gave it to the guy and when she opened the box there was the head of the girl oh gross and so since the wife said that oh since since you love this girl you might as well have her so she lifted the head gave it to the guy and the guy was stunned and he couldn't do anything since he was 2 words  yeah so the girl kind of uh took the hai the head by the hair and kind of pushed that into the guy 's face oh god so the guy was able to kiss the girl and yeah you know and and then after that uh uhm the wife left just left the head there where on the lap of the guy and she went out and turned off the lights and the guy was screaming but no one could uh could hear him uhm no one no one heard the guy no because they were living in like this house in the country oh countryside yeah where the houses are far away from each other oh what do you think of it uh it 's kinda morbid and i i hate i have a very active imagination so it 's kinda uh bloody oh yeah me too that 's supposed to be and then the head was supposed to be rotting and everything oh yeah since it has been days since the girl has been dead and the head could have been rotting so will the guy sue the girl for murder no 'cause she 'll uh the guy will probably die from fear of course not why not  i mean imagine yourself you 're in this room it is dark it has no lights you 're bound up and you know that there 's a head sitting on your lap well you could uh you can't you can't really move move it out of your way 'cause you 're bound up yeah i don't know i guess you will not words  uh gross even if you can't see the head you know that it 's there staring at you
