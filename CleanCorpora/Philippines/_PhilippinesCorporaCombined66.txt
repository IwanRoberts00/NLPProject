you know what i remember way back in ninety-four when we first started in the first all-asian tournament in singapore remember that yeah nanyang technological university yeah i wasn't there yeah 'cause you were still in i was still here you were still in main right yeah what 's your i d number again here in main uhm i d ninety-six ninety-six so you weren't here yet in ninety-four oh yeah i wasn't yeah i 'm sorry laughter  you were still in new guinea yeah in papua new guinea yeah i was still in high school yeah you know that was really so much fun 'cause that was the first time i was actually ever out of the country okay yeah i mean you 've been like to several countries already well i think it 's you 'll get to appreciate 'cause you 've left the country when you 're older what do you mean like 'cause i left the first time i got uhm papua new guinea was where i was born right i was still a kid and i didn't really remember the memories i wasn't really excited but i still i i remember the time when i left the country by myself coming to the philippines it 's more exciting oh yeah i understand na parang i i i understand like you grew up you feel liberated there yeah 'cause like 'cause like you know that was really the first time i left the country and that was the first time i was in a plane also so   uh  and you know how it is people say pal philippine airlines the service isn't that great the planes are kinda old the pilots are like you know nyak  uh-huh so i remember when i told the guys in debating team david my teammates david and and iba i was telling them guys you know this is the first time i 'm gonna leave the country this is the first time i 'm gonna be in a plane what this is the first time you 're actually leaving the country yeah yeah yeah so it was we were all there and you know on on the plane we were all seated down and then at that point i was asking okay so what happens now oh we 're gonna out we 're gonna do this and that okay and when the plane started right remember when the plane first started you start hearing these weird sounds rattling and dripping and so i started sweating i was getting really getting nervous and they 're still ribbing me uh the plane 's gonna blow up the plane 's gonna blow up oh i never heard that sound before i say what i said stop it stop it stop it leave me alone gosh i was really scared but once what and then that part i 'm sure you 'd agree with me that the worst part when you 're on a plane is just the exact moment when it leaves the ground  yeah   yeah  yeah you you 're your stomach goes topsy-turvy yeah yeah it 's like as if you know you 're like fifty feet in the air but your stomach is still at ground zero yeah gosh you feel like throwing up also when your ears pound yeah it was weird so how was your first tournament like my first tournament trip to bangkok yeah my first yeah it was really exciting i really wanted to go to bangkok i 've never been to thailand uh uhm so i was really looking forward to it and it while on the plane it was it was pretty uh a fairly short trip and landing in bangkok was was uhm  freaky yeah freaky it was like you 're landing in midnight and you 're really hungry 'cause the plane food wasn't that really good uh-huh and bangkok is pretty similar to the philippines in manila similar to manila and i really enjoyed debating there the debating experience the debating side uh-huh it was very competitive and very worthwhile debating for c s b college of saint benilde and the experience was really unforgettable and then considering you guys were all rookies right yeah not that much training our team was a rookie team also your team was a rookie team right yeah we were we were a rookie team but we still had like several weeks of practice training and you know way back then i was hanging out with the people who are the great ones today nikki bombit yeah caloy yeah r j ledesma yeah the great debaters of course the the problem in that is that you know whenever i meet someone you know you 've seen me when people say oh you 're jack right i remember you from ninety-four in the first all-asians and then all of a sudden there 's this meta-comparison of r j then r j now bombit then bombit now it was like me speaker stressing on the word 'me' laughter  it 's me still the same   yup still me me i really hate that when that happens though yeah of course i never did debate for wer weren't i keep on telling you i never debated for the competition it was always for fun yeah i didn't care if i lost yeah my main reason for debating is to go abroad just to visit countries and discover new cultures check out the chicks check out the girls uh taste the food and probably inspire you to travel later in life when i work and to build up my independence yeah it 's such a nice feeling right when you 're you know you 're there your parents aren't around you gotta take care of yourself of course yeah it 's like you 're working already and you 're traveling all around the world yeah you have to budget your money and buy food yeah it 's like i remember in singapore we had to subs we had to subsist on these two dollar rice meals 'cause we were staying in school okay and naturally the registration fee didn't cover all the meals they just pretty much covered breakfast and a few dinners you know cultural night break-in night or whatever so most of the time during lunch we 'd have to buy our own food and since it 's it 's summer there you know summer the cafeteria really wasn't the school cafeteria wasn't open just the small stalls you know just small place where they sell whatever  and you know while we were there we had to pick our food because there are only so many so many choices and some of the choices were really expensive it 's like you know it costs what it costs like about four or five singapore dollars to one american dollar and food there costs two dollars three dollars so you know in here i wasn't on a low budget i was going around like oh man i am hungry i wanna eat like ten bucks laughter twenty bucks uhm okay i think i 'll wait for the free dinner later laughter just go back for seconds yeah like like my tip trip in bangkok how i saved money so i 'cause like breakfast is really everyday right so i would eat a very heavy breakfast it 'd probably last me until the night so during the night i would probably eat a small snack and uhm keep you know keep me full for the rest of the day save save my money and spend my money on more clothes 'cause clothes are really cheap in bangkok  but the food in bangkok is really delicious it 's different from filipino food  uh uhm  uh uhm more spicy more fresh fresher vegetables and fish it 's pretty cheap compared to filipino food i mean quantity wise uh uhm it 's more cheaper  okay yeah in in singapore i didn't get the chance to do much shopping stuff there 's so expensive but i i thought something really funny 'cause when we were there walking around there was one night a bunch of us were just you know walking around checking the city singapore 's a very small city so you just you can make the what 's the main road orchard yeah yeah orchard road yeah orchard where the shops were yeah i was so surprised when we were walking down now showing lion king  and i remembered lion king had already shown here around one or two years ago yeah i was like hey this is great the philippines is actually first when it comes to movies you know something to feel proud about i don't know it 's a very small thing but you know yeah i watched that ahead of everyone else yeah if i was in the situation i 'd probably feel proud too laughter  you 've got the upper hand with the singaporeans singaporeans are out of date laughter  by one or two years yeah it 's a big thing and it 's because we 're better at getting pirated stuff i know singapore 's really strict in piracy   yeah  in piracy and the people there are so weird 'cause like   why  right in singapore you can't bring chewing gum when you smoke you can't just throw the butts anywhere yeah i remember my teammates when they 'd smoke they have to carry the butts in their pocket until they find a trash can and throw it out but and so i kinda figured that singapore 's really strict and when i got there i was kinda scared 'cause i think the caning incident already happened already in singapore michael fay yeah michael fay it already happened so joel was like uy don't get michael fayed don't get michael fayed so okay fine and so when we were walking around hey how about some gum you know we were ribbing each other there was one time we took their their their their train the m r t whatever it 's called and naturally there were signs there saying no smoking no gum no littering whatever and the people there were so serious not they 're just like sitting there straight-faced workers students they were all so serious you know i was like joking my friends we should we should put a sign there no laughing fine five hundred singaporean dollars  no really so so there i was expecting these people to be really so stuck-up and you know tight-assed and whatever and come the evening so since you know it 's the evening already so okay debaters you know debaters all party people we went to hard rock and i was so surprised the same geeky nerdy people you see debating and talking so intellectually with glasses and ivy league haircuts you see these are the same people jumping up and down on the dance floor doing the macarena doing the lambada  you know drinking you know tequila shots like it 's water something like gosh talk of your first vampires man weird singaporeans yeah i find them pretty weird how about people in thailand what were they like people in thailand were very kind they were also outgoing in parties they 're very hospi hospitable and they they like to laugh and joke around it 's similar to the filipino culture uh-huh the only problem with the thai people were they were not really fluent in english as we are in communicating  i have some fond memories of them they were very accommodating it was like it was like my fellow brothers in the philippines my fellow barkad my fellow friends in the philippines  laughter yeah i have also some fond memories of thai people i told you the story right oh yeah darn laughter  that was really weird one you know and the funny thing is years and years after that i still just sit down some place and think about it yeah what would have happened if laughter if i had gone on ahead and see what would have happened how different would my life be today if if i had let one night that 's destiny or fate how will you how will you classify destiny or fate stupidity stupidity laughter  i don't know i guess destiny yeah it 's destiny it 's destined to happen funny yeah
