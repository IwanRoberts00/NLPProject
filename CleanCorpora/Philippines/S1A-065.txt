""
""
why
""
""
uh nothing it just  passed my mind
""
""
ows really  ha   chuckle 
""
""
okay  well  well by the way how do you find the college canteen food
""
""
no comment  laughter 
""
""
no comment don't worry you 're not going to get uhm a libel or something
""
""
no no comment no comment  laughter 
""
wait how come you 're asking me those questions  ha 
""
""
why not
""
""
let me ask you questions
""
""
i find the college canteen food really fine
""
""
  yeah how often do you eat there 
""
""
 you know uhm uh   they are they are scientifically designed
""
""
what do you mean by scientifically designed
""
""
uhm they are more or less recycled over and over again
""
""
recycled you mean those wastes   are being  recycled again
""
""
 yeah  
""
for example you have  adobo  for lunch and next thing you know you have chicken curry the next day  and then pork curry
""
""
i see
""
how sure are you
""
""
 ha 
""
""
how sure are you that they are recycling it
""
""
well it 's just my guess and   mine are usually  are correct
""
""
 oh so it 's a hunch  
""
that 's good
""
""
well almost all almost always correct
""
""
uhm i see 
""
""
what can you say about the condominium uhm right beside gokongwei
""
""
well i can see that its foundation are built almost huh uhm
""
all the ground there are being laid foundation and those pillars being built right now are big
""
""
you know the size of each room
""
""
no but i expect its gonna be very expensive it will  ju  cost millions   for  one unit
""
""
 okay  
""
why don't we try to buy one
""
""
no no money
""
""
sleep there for instead of uhm sleeping here in school for our overnight for our projects or thesis and everything
""
""
yeah give me the money and i 'll buy one
""
""
sure i i can supply you
""
""
yeah you 're sure
""
""
yeah uhm i know a certain uhm ms  de leon  who would be uhm willing to support you and if you should like i can introduce you to her
""
""
really
""
""
yeah oh no no problem 
""
""
okay so
""
""
by the way how do you find the i d policy
""
""
i d policy
""
""
yeah
""
""
well it 's  i don't know
""
""
you   find it  fine or you   still look for something 
""
""
 but  
""
 it 's fine but it 's somewhat   unfair for us
""
""
why
""
  it 's a training  for you  ha  you know
""
""
 from only  
""
  yeah 
""
""
 when you   get to work you get to pin your i d
""
""
yeah though   i hope that  all college would also be like that as ours
""
""
 more or less   yeah
""
well if for example all of the colleges will uhm would promote that kind of law would we have that kind of law uhm would you feel uhm that we are treated equally
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay and therefore uhm you feel you would therefore feel that uhm the i d policy will uhm it 's time for you to graduate
""
""
yeah
""
""
is that right
""
""
actually the i d policy is fine because during our high school days we pin our i ds   always 
""
""
 yeah   i mean but you 're in college already
""
""
yeah   but still 
""
""
 it 's the   major quote unquote highlight of your college life so that you don't have to pin your i d anymore   and  you don't have to wear your uniform or something
""
""
 really   is that how you view college
""
""
yeah
""
""
well i don't
""
""
why not
""
oh how do you view college
""
""
well i viewed it more learnings and
""
""
really okay
""
""
somehow it 's somewhat part of  yung  the training that i need for me to go to work
""
""
okay by the way what kind of work are you planning to go to to work for
""
""
i hope i could be involved in a company that would really produce softwares so i would be a programmer or an analyst or even a graphics designer
""
it depends  but i don't want to do work such as inputting datas only into the database
""
""
okay so you don't like uhm secretarial type of job okay
""
""
  i hope 
""
""
 well i   when i graduate uhm  i don't like to work in in programming stuff
""
""
why
""
  and why did you find select  comsci  degree code for computer science 
""
""
 well i don't find  
""
well as long as it 's something i find joy in
""
""
really
""
""
during my high school years that is
""
""
yeah right 
""
look lilibeth lilibeth is conscious  laughter 
""
""
anyway so how do you find the no eat the eating no eating policy uhm here in la salle
""
""
well it 's  somehow a discipline for us though it 's also hard   because 
""
""
 are you   in favor of it  or are you are you against it
""
""
partially yes and partially no
""
""
okay why
""
""
because  for instance you want to eat and there are only specific places that you can eat right
""
""
yeah   are you in favor of that 
""
""
 and if those  
""
wait let me finish
""
""
okay
""
""
and if those places are already occupied then where are you going to eat right
""
so it 's somewhat it 's not really needed actually it 's just it just  1 word  discipline but not littering
""
""
okay so well uhm so in conclusion you are saying that uhm uhm you are not that uhm in favor with the policy right 
""
""
oh in some sense yes
""
""
okay  cough  well let me tell you how i feel what i feel
""
i hate that no eating policy
""
""
why
""
""
 ha 
""
""
why
""
""
 e  it 's no use you know
""
""
how come
""
""
uhm  cough  are you in favor that they are limiting uhm the places where you could eat are you in favor of that
""
""
no
""
