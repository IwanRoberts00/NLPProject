honorable  andaya chairman of the committee on appropriations  
""
""
thank you mr speaker 
""
mr speaker my distinguished colleagues ladies and gentlemen i will speak very briefly mr speaker and my dear colleagues because uh this measure uh is uh of utmost urgency
""
this bill  house bill number three one four four eight  which was certified as urgent by the president of the philippines  in her communication to the speaker dated july twenty-one nineteen ninety  seeks to appropriate ten billion pesos for aid relief and rehabilitation services to people and areas and for the repair and reconstruction of government infrastructures affected by the strong temblor that struck the philippines very recently 
""
the temblor that shook luzon island in the afternoon of july sixteen nineteen ninety recorded recorded at seven point seven on the richter 's scale is one of the strongest and most destructive in our history
""
mr speaker only two days after the quake five hundred twenty-eight were reported dead one thousand one hundred twenty-three injured and over one thousand persons still trapped in buildings while fifteen thousand six hundred forty-six families were reported to have been left homeless with the destruction of one thousand seven hundred eighty-five houses
""
the damage to highways and bridges water systems power lines hospitals and school buildings and other public infrastructures run into billions of pesos
""
because of the massive devastation mr speaker president corazon c aquino issued proclamation number six thirteen declaring several cities and provinces under state of calamity
""
while significant government efforts have been done to alleviate the suffering of the people affected by this calamity a supplemental budget is necessary to speed up the process of rehabilitation  for the families of the victims and the reconstruction of the affected areas
""
hence mr speaker this urgent bill for our favorable consideration and immediate approval
""
thank you mr speaker
""
""
mr speaker please mr speaker
""
""
what 's the pleasure of the gentleman from agusan del sur
""
""
agusan del norte mr speaker
""
""
agusan del norte
""
""
uh may the distinguished sponsor yield to some clarificatory questions
""
""
the gentleman may yield if he if he so desires
""
""
very willingly mr speaker
""
""
number one mr speaker i do not wish to be misunderstood that i am against this bill
""
but this must be asked necessarily in order that this bill may really respond to the desired aims
""
so mr speaker the first question i would like to ask is  in the light of my experience every bill of this kind is always subjected to the objection anchored on our  cons  the constitutional provision that special appropriations  must always be accompanied by a certificate from the national treasurer on the availability of funds or in the absence thereof that it must have a revenue measure accompanying such bill to support the funds desired
""
now in this particular bill  uh i i do not see these things despite the urgency mr uh speaker
""
""
the point is well taken mr speaker
""
indeed the constitution provides that a supplemental appropriation of this nature should be accompanied by a revenue measure out of which funds can be generated  or certificate of availability of funds issued by the national treasurer
""
we have your honor the corresponding certificate of availability of funds for this purpose
""
in fact we have here inside this hall uh the national treasurer herself ms uh rose cajucom who issued the certificate of availability of funds to support this house bill three one four four eight
""
""
well uh i asked this mr speaker because i do not like that our rhetorics will not be accompanied by the necessary heroics
""
because i was so told and it was printed in the papers that we are running a deficit of approximately eleven or seventeen billion
""
if we are running a deficit that much then there is a problem about availability of funds
""
but anyway i 'll not dispute this anyway
""
if mr cajucom   uh  ms cajucom is already here and you know in visayan  =language  cajucom is  judgment  and if she wears that family name as a judgment uh that there is i have no right to dispute mr speaker
""
that was only for clarification
""
thank you mr speaker
""
""
 ms cajucom  
""
""
thank you
""
 mr speaker mr speaker the gentleman from uh bukidnon
""
""
will the gentleman the honorable sponsor yield to a few questions mr speaker
""
 the gentleman may yield if he so desires
""
""
willingly mr speaker your honor
""
""
this is only a follow-up uh question of the honorable gentleman from agusan
""
mr speaker we have no objections if there is availability of funds
""
but we would like only to know mr speaker where will this availability of funds be coming from
""
because we have also commitments to our constituents where we are willing to sacrifice for as long as we are advised so that our own constituents will not be hoping for this to come while we are transferring it to the affected areas
""
we just want to know this mr speaker because uh it will be very difficult if my constituents in my district mr speaker are expecting all the fundings already appropriated for and approved under this appropriations act of nineteen ninety and then the money will come from there it is alright with us
""
but i will make the announcement that we will have to sacrifice we will not expect anything this year because we 're giving it to our brothers in the north who have been affected
""
we would like to know this mr speaker rather than having our constituents hoping for this and never come again mr speaker and we will be blamed for it
""
""
uhm that 's a good point mr speaker but uh i would like to call the attention of the distinguished gentleman from bukidnon that precisely section one of the bill provides that it shall be from funds in the national treasury not otherwise appropriated
""
  because  if we do not put that phraseology of  funds not otherwise appropriated  i share the concern of the distinguished gentleman from bukidnon that it 's very possible that this amount to support the ten billion would be taken from the funds already appropriated including those for the projects in bukidnon
""
""
 so  
""
so we are made to understand that mr speaker that the ten billion already certified by the national treasury will not affect any approved appropriated funds for nineteen ninety
""
""
to my thinking your honor this should not affect adversely
""
""
so this money will come from other sources   that may be from savings  or other incomes of   the government 
""
""
 yes your honor    yes  
""
""
thank you your honor
""
""
thank you
""
""
mr speaker
""
""
mr speaker
""
""
the gentleman from bohol
""
""
thank you mr speaker
""
will the sponsor yield to a few questions
""
""
the sponsor may yield
""
""
mr speaker there are two gentlemen from bohol now on the floor
""
may i please know which uh gentleman is being recognized
""
""
the gentleman from the opposition
""
""
uh may i have the reservation that after the gentleman from the opposition from bohol will be through with the interpellation that this representation be accorded the same privilege
""
""
the other gentleman from bohol may seek recognition   after uh  the  gen  uh the gentleman from the opposition in bohol shall have uh finished with his interpellation
""
""
 thank you  
""
""
thank you mr speaker
""
may we know from the sponsor as to whether there is such a thing as  funds in the national treasury not already appropriated
""
""
well actually we have funds in the treasury
""
we have funds in the different government owned or controlled banks
""
we even have funds in the uhm central bank 
""
but you see i would like to explain this your honor that uh this ten billion will not be spent in one sweep 
""
we are just giving the authority to the executive to incur obligations and disburse later on
""
because even if we have the money in the world even if we have money in the  bodegas  without this appropriation measure that centavo or that money cannot be spent
""
so this is some kind of a standby appropriation
""
what we need is the authority from congress in order to enable the executive branch to attend to the victims of the earthquake and to reconstruct or rehabilitate the affected affected infrastructures of government
""
""
does it mean mr speaker that we do not know as of the present whether we have this ten billion pesos available from the funds in the national treasury
""
""
well uh according to the treasurer of the philippines  the funds will be made  avo  available 
""
and then uh if you ask me the possible sources well we have just passed the  sin taxes 
""
it should generate three point four billion
""
remember the sin taxes were supposed to be for the veterans
""
but the amount for veterans would amount only to  mga  about one point seven
""
and then per report of the finance secretary we had increased collection at least for the first quarter of two hundred  fif  forty million pesos
""
but uh it is very possible that bonds will be circulated reconstruction bonds would be sold to institutional investors reconstruction bonds because we have money for example in insurance companies
""
they have plenty of money
""
they would like to have investments
""
we have retirement funds
""
we have commercial funds
""
these can be invested in bonds
""
and uh we have we can float bonds for the overseas workers because we have  do  dollar deposits of overseas workers in the f c d u foreign currency deposit units of the different banks here in the philippines
""
these dollar deposits may be used to purchase these uh dollar bonds
""
and uh it is very possible if we are short of funds it is very possible we have friends countries
""
we have reconstruction bonds a d b world bank at very very concessional rates to reconstruct
""
but in the meantime because it takes time to do all those things
""
these banks would uh want to be presented feasibility studies what are these projects to be undertaken the costing
""
it will take time
""
but congress should give the authority to the executive branch to implement all these things to alleviate the sufferings of the victims and to reconstruct the damage
""
""
thank you   mr speaker 
""
""
 and   uh if it is possible if our creditors would be too sympathetic i just filed a a resolution that perhaps we should be given suspension of payments for a period of two years
""
because mr speaker it is not only the increased expenditure of ten billion
""
this is a double kill
""
it is very possible there is going to be reduced income
""
there will be increased expenditure and at the same time reduced income
""
there are mining companies that have been devastated by this earthquake
""
real estate taxes will suffer
""
the taxes that were paid before by commercial establishments would not be paid
""
perhaps even income taxes would suffer
""
but in the meantime that we have the money after all as certified we now should give this authority so that congress shows its concern that in the midst of this devastation congress is in a position to act immediately
