romero

this was held earlier and uh this is the four by one hundred meter
free style relay women finals
""
another exciting offering in the third or fourth day of action of
the sixteenth southeast asian games manila  music  
""
and our colleague who covered the swimming event the four by one
hundred  met  uh meter medley relay for men finals of course none
other than rene monteclaro
""
and here 's that report
""
""
 magandang gabi po sa inyong lahat mga kaibigan
""
""
we 're back here at the rizal memorial swimming pool for the fifth
and final event of the evening and that 's the four by four hundred meter
medley relay for men
""
top favorite for the event is the quartet from the philippines
composed of  ryan papa lee concepcion eric buhain and leo najera
""
they will be swimming on lane number four
""
swimming on lane number five will be the quartet from singapore
composed of lim conjuc that 's david lim ong yemeng conong kit and ang peng
shiong
""
these are the quartet this is the quartet for uh singapore
""
swimming on lane number three singapore will be swimming on lane
number five swimming on lane number three is the quartet from thailand
composed of duliarit phuantong  paratatong  name 
narong tantayatong and  name 
""
and on lane number six is the quartet from indonesia and that is
composed of felix ocampo  name  sodiono pagini and richard
tambera 
""
 naghahanda na po sa mga sandaling ito at medyo itong si leo
najera ay nakalimutang magdala ng  swimming trunk  ano
""
kaya hinihintay pa  and then  nagpalit lang siya ng
 swimming trunk
""
 'yon po ang naging dahilan ng mga  cheering 
sa mga sandaling ito dito sa may  pool side  at sa mga
nanonood 
""
 itong  final event this is a four by four hundred
meter medley relay
""
 tinitingnan ko pa kung sino ang unang tatalon para sa
pilipinas 
""
it usually starts off with a back stroke uh if i get it right in a
an individual or a medley relay  apat na tao apat na iba't-ibang
 strokes  ang tatakbuhin nila
""
at uh  ang nangyayari ay hinihintay pa natin  laughter 
si leo najera nang matapos niyang ayusin ang kanyang sarili at uh nagpalit
siya ng  swimming trunks  ano uh may humingi may tumatakbo
kasing may dala-dalang uh o  additional  na panibagong
 swimming trunks  para kay leo najera ng pilipinas
""
itong si leo najera itong  uh u s bred and u s trained uh
he grew up in the united states of a filipino father and american mother and
uh  has been swimming for the university of southern california or uh
excuse me i stand corrected university of california berkeley campus
""
uh he will be teaming up with lee concepcion ryan papa and uh eric
buhain for the philippines
""
 hindi pa natin natatanaw ang kanilang uh magiging 
sequence
""
i think it 's going to be uh leo najera uh swimming first for the
philippines  uh hindi naghugas lang siya nagbasa lang siya ng buhok
 uh hindi pa yata natitiyak mga kaibigan 
""
we 're getting ready for the finals uh of the four by four hundred
four by four hundred meter uh medley relay with the philippines hot favorite
""
 sinasabi nga ng iba  sure gold for the philippines
""
we 'll probably end up with two golds one silver and one bronze
but that 's not good enough to dislodge thailand for the evening who have
already garnered two golds two silvers and one bronze from one final event or
four final events
""
so  titingnan natin kung  at least 
makapantay man lang tayo sa  gold medal tally  at uh medyo mas
nakarami ang  thailand
""
 may mga  events  kasi kanina na 
either one two or one three or two three  ang  thailand
 katulad nitong sa uh  itong sa uh  one thousand five
