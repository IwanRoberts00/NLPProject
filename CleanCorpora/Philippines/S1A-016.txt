hello
""
my name is wendy and i 'm here with pammy
""
say hi pammy
""
""
hi
""
i 'm pammy
""
""
okay so today we 're going to talk about our childhood moments
""
so i 'm going to start
""
i remember once one time when i was in grade three i was in ms mrs barstow 's class and i was around  oh nine years old  so one day mrs barstow asked us asked us to draw a picture with the theme stop look and listen
""
it was a safety theme like in the traffic when uhm when you 're crossing the street what you what should you do first
""
you should stop    look  both ways right and    listen  for cars
""
""
 look   
""
 listen   
""
yeah
""
""
that way you 're sure to be safe
""
so i drew a picture with three scenes
""
uhm in the first scene a girl  just stops she 's just standing there
""
the second scene she was looking in one direction and the next scene she had her hand up to her ear so as to say she 's listening for something
""
and the funny thing about my picture was  the look of the girl  giggles 
""
she  she had so much make-up on  laughter  the her eyes are eye shadow was blue and she has  real  really    really red  lipstick
""
""
 red blush   
""
and a blush-on
""
""
and a blush
""
""
blush-on
""
""
like you 'd think she 'd look like the nanny  reference to a television character  with big hair and and thin body and make-up
""
i think it was because i was influenced so much by my mother because growing up i always saw her every morning applying her make-up
""
""
yeah just like the flintstones that  flintstones'  advertisement wherein the kid one time uhm her mom went out oh i think went to work and then she she went inside her mom 's room and then she got all those make-up stuff of her mom
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
yeah remember
""
""
she 's trying    to put  make-up on and the    lipstick 's going  everywhere and yeah so my picture really looked strange especially since she had so much make-up on
""
""
 yeah   
""
 yeah   
""
""
well anyway so we submitted all our pictures in to the teacher
""
and unknowingly what the teacher did was she submitted all our drawings into a contest a traffic contest that was sponsored by oh some traffic organization for safety and 
""
so in a few days she gave us back our pictures  but then i noticed that i didn't get mine back
""
so i thought where 's mine 'cause everybody else have theirs you know
""
i didn't wanna feel left out
""
so i asked mrs barstow where is my picture and then she goes and then she says that she entered my picture into a into that contest and it hadn't come back
""
so i thought a contest okay that 's fine    so 
""
""
 how    old were you then
""
""
i was around nine or ten grade three and uhm 
""
so after a few days  my drawing came back  and my teacher said  that i had won  that my entry was one of the selected drawings from uh in a in that contest that which is open to so many others from different schools
""
""
oh that 's great wen
""
so what did you get
""
what prize did you get
""
""
well it wasn't really a prize thing but i did get the poster that on which they printed all the different uhm drawings that they selected as winners
""
so that was nice
""
i actually have that poster up till now
""
""
wow that 's great
""
""
oh so well what about you pam  break in the recording 
""
""
well for me uhm  when i was in grade three i also remember we used to have art classes every wednesdays and fridays i guess so but that was a long time ago
""
but what i enjoyed most about my childhood years was that i i always bring my barbie stuff my barbie dolls remember
""
""
oh barbie i had one uhm
""
""
yeah i have i guess i have three and i always bring the three barbies to school and of course show them off to my friends and we play all day
""
one time  uhm it was our yeah i remember it was ms garcia 's class
""
i think that was our filipino class yeah
""
and then i i i don't wanna listen i i don't know i guess i was just so excited with my with my new barbie
""
and then so i didn't listen and and then while in the class i was playing with my barbie and then my  sis  the worst thing is my sister saw me playing me with the barbie
""
and then so of course the teacher approach approached me and she talked to me uhm ms villanueva why are you not listening to me do stop
""
and then i go like no miss i am listening
""
then my teacher told me okay well give me your barbie
""
after that of course the the the the usual reaction of a kid is to cry
""
so i cried as in i really cried
""
so when i went home my mom asked me oh why are  yo  why are your eyes so red
""
so i told him what happened
""
and then the next day my mom my mom went to my teacher
""
""
whoa
""
""
yeah
""
""
mom against teacher
""
""
my mom actually my mom didn't  parang  uhm didn't shout at my teacher or what
""
she just asked of course why is my uhm barbie with her 'cause i didn't tell her uhm i didn't tell her i didn't told her that i was i wasn't listening
""
so otherwise my mom was thinking that my teacher just got  just got
""
""
just took your barbie away
""
""
yeah just took my barbie away
""
so what happened is instead of my mom  scol  uhm uhm scolding my teacher at the end my mom scolded me so 
""
until now i don't know if my barbie is still in the house but i remember i didn't get it back anymore 
""
""
pammy i think you 're the original barbie girl  laughter 
""
well barbies actually i didn't really get a barbie until i was pretty old
""
""
really
""
""
uh i mean some girls get it when they 're    six  or seven
""
i got mine when i was eight or nine and i think it was given to me by my godfather and godmother
""
""
 six   
""
oh that 's nice
""
in our family as in all of us should have barbie at least one
""
""
yikes
""
actually i don't really like dolls those that kind of dolls even
""
""
dolls with long hair
""
""
yeah
""
""
sexy bodies
""
""
what i really liked were the dresses
""
i loved dressing them up
""
i had a barbie and she had this long dress and sometimes since she had such a long dress i 'd make it shorter    or  up to the knees 'cause it really went down up to her ankles
""
""
 yeah   
""
""
unfortunately of course i had a brother and being a brother he broke the head off
""
""
 yeah 
""
oh
""
""
so there you go
""
no more barbie  beheaded barbie
""
""
