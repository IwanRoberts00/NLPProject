we 're using the chunks in water yung red label natin because the red label is the versatile type of tuna of tuna wherein you can add it to a lot of things 'no  vegetables you can add it to uhm tawag dito to salads to soups just about to any any recipe that you would want to put tuna into so we have a very nice uh bowl here ia- assemble  lang natin yung ating salad yes may custom plate so we have here and then we have lettuce 'no lalagay lang natin dun sa  bottom nung ating salad bowl shredded ng ganito sylvs 'no   'yon  have it shredded like that and then you start to build up  lang ibi- build up lang natin yung salad  kumbaga building-up means parang pagpapatong-patungin lang natin  so we have carrots finely chopped 'no papatong lang natin siya  if you want to cut it medyo malalaki para medyo parang uh mas chunky siya you can do that 'no and then we have uh green eh i mean sorry red bell pepper you can even cut this into strips if you want 'no kaya lang  we 're doing it medyo on a uniform scale so we have uhm onions sliced 'no we 're using white onions para medyo sweeter ang dating niya  okay and then we have our capers 'no sa ibabaw din  and then we have our tuna yung tuna natin papatong lang din natin sa ibabaw so we can put that whole can in there we 're using two cans of century tuna just spread that on top and then we can uhm sprinkle it with a little uhm this is coriander leaves 'no chopped dyan lang sa ibabaw  it 's wansoy oo cilantro  iwan tayo ng kaunti while we move to our next procedure sylvs which is preparing our dressing okay so for our dressing we have a bowl here ayan ho meron tayong uhm sour cream  alam mo almost all mexican food they love to put sour cream and lime and avocado litsugas at keso sa kanila  and corn plays a very important uh role kasi di ba they they dance they dance for rain para mag- grow yung  corn nila  then we add a little hot sauce and then meron tayong  cumin yung cumin na nabibili natin dito  ground na  these are actually uh comes from seed 'no and then you toast them maganda nga if you toast them freshly and then you grind grind it na para mas matindi yung flavor but for convenience you can use already the this mayonnaise so imi- mix lang natin until very smooth okay and then we add a little bit of lime juice 'no kung wala silang lime juice they can use calamansi or lemon lemon juice ayan  we can put our dressing on top layer it and then we have avocado  pa sylvs 'no to go on top so well uhm let 's just pour everything there what we 're going to do next is put our avocado wedges on top  panahon ng avocado kaya  but this is actually this is good fat you know avocado is considered a fat but it 's good fat because it 's uhm low cholesterol yes  maganda kung medyo hindi masyadong ripe  yung avocado so it holds better and then we have some uhm cilantro leaves 'no that you can put there eto yun to give it a very fresh look  ayan  there you go our mexican tuna salad from century   pinakbet with century tuna ayan  uh alam mo sylvs the usual traditional  pinakbet na ginagawa natin  but alam mo pag pumunta ka kasi sa ilocos region  ano they put uh bagnet in your  pinakbet oo kaya lang minsan ang nangyayari kung mayroon kang  hypertension or umiiwas ka sa sa red meat it 's nice to to use an alternative 'no  so you have the super meat century tuna na siyang gagawin nating parang crispy tuna na gagawin nating topping for our pinakbet  so yung procedure natin we have two cans of century tuna chunky talaga grabe 'yan and  ang gagawin natin sylvs is uh lalagyan ho natin ng konting asin 'no  and then uhm over here nagpainit tayo ng uhm oil  'no and we 're going to deep fry our tuna hanggang sa maging brown when we deep fry mainit na yung ating cooking oil  kailangan tatakpan natin kasi nga may moisture siya so we will let that fry 'no i- fry lang natin siya hanggang sa maging light brown  yun pag naging light brown siya ganito na yung magiging hitsura niya but we will set that aside this is like it 's crunchy it 's crispy it 's very tasty and then with a little oil  'no the usual procedure lang yung ating bawang 'no 'yan and then we have konting ginger kasi may bagoong isda tayo hindi bagoong alamang which is one kind so pag nag-umpisa na siyang mainit we start adding our next ingredient which is yung ating sibuyas 'no  and then kamatis yung kamatis natin ginawa nating  chunk very chunky yung kamatis para magbigay din siya ng magandang  sauce so yung sabaw about two cups of tomatoes  ayan  so we this is our bagoong isda 'no very very aromatic ito yung magpapalasa   mapapansin mo wala na tayong asin walang vetsin  because this is good enough to taste to ano to flavor your uhm pinakbet 'no  so ilalagay natin yung ating kalabasa so you start with the matitigas first so this is kalabasa  sabay-sabay na natin 'no and then we will just cover it this is our okra 'no ilalagay lang natin diyan sa ibabaw at saka pag naggugulay tayo huwag nating haluin nang haluin  and then this is our uh eggplant na hiniwa natin ng ganito ibinabad lang sa tubig para di mangitim  so tatakpan natin hanggang lumambot siya and cooked half-way well this is about ready already ayan tingnan mo o  very nice you still have the intense green color 'no and then we take it off the heat 'no and then we words  there sa platter natin 'no  so get this ise- serve natin dito  you have to pagka- fry nyo you have to drain it from the oil sylvs 'no para hindi masyadong  oily but as it is mukhang napakasarap nito  or you can sprinkle it or if you want you can serve it on the side  pa rin 'no sprinkle it yes low cholesterol 'no you fry it in corn oil very very little oil this is low fat pinakbet  and we 're going to do this very special recipe for you out there we call it baked potatoes with cottage cheese and tuna it 's another healthy dish 'no na making use of potatoes 'no which is very rich in potassium and of course  ang ating bida century tuna chunks in water and the nice thing about it is we 're going to mix it together with cottage cheese 'no  so very uhm high en ito high protein  talaga but first pakita ko lang sylvia  kung how they 're going to uhm deal with their baked potatoes 'no  so you have potatoes na ganito kalalaki 'no this is ideal for baked potatoes  kailangan ii- scrub nila using a vegetable brush 'no wag naman yung gamit na toothbrush vegetable brush ho ano o kaya uh basta any brush na malinis and then really really scrub it 'no   kasi you can eat the skin and it 's very very healthy and then you get a little bit of uhm shortening 'no  shortening kukuha ka lang kayo gayon you have to rub the whole thing so mantikang puti yes so ira- rub  natin yan 'no  and using a foil to keep and lock in the the goodness of your uhm what do you call this of your potatoes 'no iaano natin siya ibabalutin natin 'no  so you seal that 'no  stick it in the oven at three-seventy-five for thirty to forty minutes okay so lalagay natin diyan  but we have already a finished product  binake na namin kasi we 're not gonna wait for that long  eto na yung finished product natin so umpisahan na natin ang ating topping or filling  'no  sylvs it 's a very very simple procedure 'no  so all we need is uhm yung ating cottage cheese  ilalagay lang natin you strain the excess liquid 'no  lagay nyo lang sa sa strainer para hindi masyadong basa uh pwede rin ang cheddar cheese basta ige-  grate mo lang siya  and then you have a little bit of mayonnaise okay and then and then  itong ating chopped celery yeah this will add crunch and texture into our uhm tuna 'no and then your chunks in water ayan magandang gamitin  red label guaranteed mas maraming laman 'no punung-puno and then onions 'no white onions nice for fish okay and then a squeeze of calamansi or lemon together with 'no  and salt and pepper minix na natin yung salt and pepper natin  so maganda ito kung ichi- chill mo ng konti sa fridge 'no uhm for about twenty minutes but we can a already use it diretso 'no to fill our baked potatoes  ito yung ating baked potatoes habang mainit siya you slit 'no  then you make uh slit like that and then ang gagawin natin ipu- push natin lalo na pag mainit yan you have to push it 'no to give it a really an open look 'no ayan oo  and we will fill it with our tuna ayan so hindi lang  sour cream or butter 'no you can also use century tuna and this is already a complete meal in itself 'no  let 's put that in our you can put parsley 'no you can put chives on top 'no  there you go  we 're going to use of course yung ating bida  the red label

wansoy ita- topping  natin yan  now we put in the rest of the wansoy 'no  or yung coriander natin sylvia  'no  so this is done already  sandaling-sandali lang siya sylvs because the noodles is made from rice 'no and it cooks very very fast then iga- garnish natin siya  with yung ating uh sugar some cilantro and of course the peanuts 'no  if they want to put uhm yung uhm cooked eggs uhm in rice
