good afternoon mike yo  uh how about you mel what can you say about this afternoon i 'm tired uh but i 'm fine except i 'm tired same here tired fine how about you mercy are you tired and fine laughter  me i 'm okay it 's just that i 'm having this kind of interest right now something about my hobbies that i would like to share but i would like to think about other else to hear other sides or other people 's comments about their hobbies or something like what they do for during how many days already for these past days so what can you say about your hobbies or what interests you right now uh i 'm currently indulged in reading lots of books mostly analytical books so uh more on the line of psychology philosophy religion people relations that sort of stuff and oh can you tell something about that well the latest book that i 'm reading is by a bishop named uh john shelby spong okay the title of the book is why christianity must change or die it 's a quite controversial book uhm here uh fr fr spong uh believes that uh most of the dictums or most of the practices of the of the church whether catholic or protestant are already outdated and already uhm uh not very useful anymore in modern society so he suggests ways in which we can uh revive or uh revive our faith or make the faith more significant and more attuned to the times i think it 's a very deep or enriching kind of book isn't it yes i i i should say so the language that is used by the author is quite deep but i like books like that they kind of challenge me how about you mel what kind of books do you like to read although i do have interests in analytical and psychological aspects of life i i believe that adventure and espionage interest me too and right now i am reading clive cussler 's wow i forgot the title of the book but geez i 'm just wind up but that 's okay anyway and i 'm already nearing it 's just like this shanghai express and i think this person just never dies the main character dirk pitt that is okay aside from books let 's talk about other kinds of interests that you have right now can you tell something about any interest you like to talk about mike  cough well i do have many interests but uhm they 're seasonal laughter  so it really depends upon uh my mood for a certain uh number of months like i said my indulgence right now probably for four years now is really books i 'm really into books right now those kinds of books but uhm if you just ask me what are my other interests well uh well you you know mercy i i love music so i love listening to music uh i like to sing e dance and all of that stuff yeah so that would be one of my main interests what do you do during weekends uh you mel i bake oh really i bake actually before i really came uh before i taught here i trained in a hotel because i was supposed to be shipping to new york oh yeah i was supposed to go there because i wanted to become a chef but well i was lured here so here at school but anyway that won't stop me from my dream so but actually because there 's two aspects like being a chef but what i wanted in particular is to become a pastry chef so i 'd like to train more with the cakes and all those frilly stuff and presentations uhm you know what mike mike also i think you have that family business about pastries yeah you have the same characteristics or same interests that 's good okay aside from that what else well since you mentioned it i also cook uhm i cook more than bake uh but i like baking too it 's it 's sort of uh a hand-me-down kind of a talent or or hobby uhm it started off with my grandmother on my mom 's side she she she loved to cook and she turned it to a business and up to now we still have that business from my grandmom to my mom and then down to me so we 're all we 're more or less a cooking family yeah uh one time at the mall i saw you and is it with are you with your sister and grandmother or was that your mother that you were going down the escalator from glorietta four  well i would like to think i would like to believe that was my mom because if that was my grandmom you would have seen a paranormal uh phenomenon laughter  okay so what else  what do you like to cook yeah that 's good my specialty 's pastas i love cooking pasta and uhm uhm like i said my mom cooks the things that she 's good at cooking i can't make like i can't make the usual adobo i 'm not good at that nilaga but my mom makes fabulous there 's nilaga waiting for me at home right now it 's really really fabulous she cooks empanada  her bestsellers like pastillas i can't do that but the thing is when it comes to pasta when anyone orders pasta from us i do the cooking because my mom cannot make pastas as well as i can thank you wow uhm actually i 've been practicing making pasta but it 's just like the simple pesto and uh pomodoro from scratch although it 's not yet uh i have not really road-tested it too much so it 's not appreciated yet just yet because i 'm i 'm more i 'm i 'm really more of like a vegetarian so i try to get into that cooking since i also love pasta myself so i tried to experiment with the basic i think i agree that italian cooking and french cooking are very basic so i 'm trying that i 've i 'm kinda i 'm i 'm kind of like the traditional cooking first so there me i 'm not very good in cooking because i 'm an only child and my mother is always there for me so that 's why it 's it 's really my frustration right now but i think it there 's still hope i think and then one thing i would like to bring up with you is something about your vocation or our vocation our teaching career so i don't think it 's a boring kind of thing to be brought up today i think me for myself i like to talk about my kids my students my grade one students because they 're very very very active very alert and every day is such kind of a new experience for me and like what i have shared this afternoon du during our colloquium we talked i talked and i shared about this kind of boy his name is juan and this boy is very very active very very alert and something like sometimes just squeezing twitching or anything that you would like to think about him he does it for example standing without asking permission but at the other side i talked and i shared with the group something about him that touched my heart this morning heart ha  it 's like he approached me this morning at my table and he said teacher i will be going to states it 's much longer but then i just have to say this to you in advance that i 'll be going there and i will not forget you imagine coming from a grade one student and then he said i will send a package for you and you know what what 's inside the package the very first thing that he thought about is he will replace my old chalk holder imagine that a boy saying that kind of stuff for me what do you think about him well i guess he 's very thoughtful yeah i 'm i 'm not really i have to admit i 'm not very well-oriented with the uh uh psychological profile of grade two students i 'm more oriented with the upper grades uhm but the most i would say oh i guess he 's a very thoughtful kid uhm he knows he knows what you want see and he he thinks about you and he 's very sociable too which that that 's very characteristic of many students in san agustin yeah actually juan happens to be my student and i would share the same thoughts about him he 's very thoughtful he 's actually very sweet and many times actually he would ask the most if i guess for a grade one student he would ask most high-faluting questions or sometimes if i would say if i talk to them to the whole class i would say somethi a word that 's not familiar he would ask all the time what 's the meaning of this word for example then i don't know it wasn't just one occasion but it was like several occasions he would ask so i i think he 's like curious he wants to learn but sometimes we 'd deviate from my subject which is which is music but i 'd be glad really like to talk to them all the time and i remember seeing him in the mall really yeah i think that was my first i think that was my first experience in the mall actually somebody calling out my name really loud in front of my mom and my brother but it wasn't anything really embarrassing i mean although i i guess in the be beginning i wasn't really used to it so it just felt so weird it just felt so weird there in the mall but uh he was with his actually with his sister and parents so fir first it 's like i felt i don't know if it 's like embarrassing or something but i guess i just have to get used to it and it didn't end there wherever i go there 's somebody you know somebody will see you yeah get used to it yeah you see i don't know some of them they saw i think they were like they saw me like in the restaurant and then i think at mass so the next the week after miss you know what you were at magallanes this uh last sunday i saw you you were wearing sneakers you were wearing jeans laughter you were wearing a striped shirt and you were wearing a parka and you were with your sister  but no i don't have sisters it was my mom so i don't know probably i will get used to that so like okay so wherever i go even though just in the grocery uh i am likely to see somebody that 's a very nice kind of experience we have been getting with these kind of pupils but then how about paper works what can you say about it well thank god i 'm not teaching language anymore last year i had agh enormous load of paperwork 'cause i was uh i used to be a language teacher grade seven language teacher so that means uhm every week you have spelling lists to the sum of three hundred fifty spelling lists to check and then every week you have a quiz to check almost every day you have seatworks you have the homeworks you have the notebooks and you have the the mastery test twice and it 's in a quarter and it 's not a joke to to check language tests 'cause they 're they 're whole sentences and grade seven kids don't really write very good sentences and they don't write well okay so uhm it was horrible and the activity sheets i had uh it 's a good thing i had an empty desk beside me last year  the whole desk was filled with with activity sheets for the next quarter you could hardly see me behind the pile of behind a stack of papers well fortunately now uh they transferred me to speech and reading i 'm only teaching two three sections in reading and there 's a lot less paperwork now speech no paperwork at all so uh i thank my coordinator for that
