""
""
why
""
""
i don't know  i really don't know
""
""
why can't you tell why can you tell me
""
""
i i don't know you know tsk when you 're  sh  in front of her and you my god uh  tsk uh when i i 'm in front of her it 's as if i 'm looking at a mirror you know  just looking straight at a mirror and see myself and i don't it 's tsk it 's uh   well 
""
""
 so you mean   to tell me she looks like you
""
""
of course not
""
""
you 're reflections of each other   or 
""
""
 uhm  
""
you 'll tsk c 'mon
""
uh what i mean is 'cause i know her that well  and she knows me that well
""
""
  that 
""
""
 that   that means i can't hide anything from her   see 
""
""
 you can't   hide   anything from her 
""
""
 it 's it 's what   it 's like i 'm thinking of something and when i look at her she knows what i 'm thinking
""
""
oh you have a connection
""
""
yeah i think so
""
uh yes i 'd like to believe so
""
you know  whenever she 's around  it 's as if  i 'd like to look at  her and not care about anything else
""
so then  you see whenever on saturdays we i we basically go to her place
""
""
huh what do you do
""
""
oh i what i mean is i i bring her home
""
""
  you  bring her    to which home 
""
""
 and  
""
 uh   to to their home
""
""
oh
""
""
and  uh it 's as if
""
""
you bring her home from where
""
""
   word  
""
""
 where   where does she stay
""
""
she stays with her auntie
""
""
oh
""
""
uh they live at pasay it 's along taft avenue
""
""
oh near la salle
""
""
yeah yeah i think so yeah
""
anyway that 's how it is
""
uhm whenever
""
""
oh so she only goes home during saturdays
""
""
not necessarily only on saturdays and sundays but whenever she could
""
""
uh okay
""
""
because you know she 's still a student by the way
""
""
so during saturdays you take her
""
""
home
""
""
to their home
""
""
yeah and we go out although it 's not as fancy as some people might think 'cause well she 's more or less a high society girl not i mean it 's not that she 's  co&ntilde;o  you know that term
""
it 's not that she 's  co&ntilde;o  or something but she 's she is just used to the the good life well
""
""
and you 're not
""
""
no it 's not that i 'm not but i haven't been quite
""
""
pampered
""
""
no i haven't been quite exposed to that kind of girl
""
