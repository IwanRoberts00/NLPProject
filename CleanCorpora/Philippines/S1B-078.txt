states said you have to have a second opinion and they looked at it and it
was benign the calcifications were benign

 sai  he was able to feel it at that time

risk factor  ho ano   laughs 
""
""
how old were you when you started to menstruate
""
""
uh thirteen
""
""

""
""
not that regular
""
""
when did you have menopause
""
""
fifty-three i think at age fifty-three
""
""
may i take a look at you
""
""
yes
""
doctor here 's the bone scan  po   hands her the
bone scan report     
""
""
 okay   good
""
""
 hindi ko pa rin hindi ko napa-  xerox
""
""
okay
""
""
that means negative  po ano    
""
""
thank you  kasi       no
definite negative   sabi ko  i couldn't understand
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 i was assuring her  
""
 sabi ko  doctor english  yan  
long break - doctor does physical exam 
""
""
let 's check out your data
""
""
 oho  
""
 ang ingay nung  air-con
""
""
the  ano ho  the mass is not very big but it 's
not small   either 
""
""
 either   yes
""
""
so it 's a t two lesion they call it
""
t is tumor size
""
it 's t one t two t three you are two
""
""
 opo 
""
""
the lymph nodes are negative so that 's favorable  
 
""
so the probability that the tumor has spread elsewhere is not very
high
""
in that situation if the nodes are negative at most it 's twenty
percent chance that it has spread
""
your uhm estrogen receptor assay is positive so this tells us that
you will respond to hormonal therapy    
""
so any hormonal treatment most likely fifty percent chance you will
respond to
""
uhm the her two neu is strongly positive
""
we we cannot give a correlation between  tum  the biologic
nature of the tumor based on her two neu
""
the the best test is still a fish analysis
""
but since that test is not available locally or even if it is it 's
so expensive this is a rough estimate of her two neu and you are strongly
positive
""
this  plus three greater than fifty percent  is
indirectly telling us that as far as her two neu is concerned you are
positive
""
but the only correlation we can make with her two neu is that if
this is positive we can we cannot use mild agents so   hindi
  directly telling us aggressiveness of behavior but those that
are strongly positive usually do not respond well to mild treatment it has to
be strong treatment
""
so i think this is uh among your your factors is not very good
""
all the rest  words  negative liver negative
chest x-ray negative bone scan so it looks like you 're clear of everything
outside except for that the uh tumor has a potential of being quite
aggressive    
""
number two there 's another problematic factor also
""
the basal line of the section is too close is too close to the
tumor
""
it 's only point four c m     so it 's very close
to the base
""
so in that situation i will worry about local recurrence the
probability that just one tumor cell is left there is quite likely
""
so uh there are quite a number of options for treatment
""
it can be reasonable it can be reasonable to just put you on a
hormonal agent
""
you know that 's one option a hormonal agent
""
now if you had to let me choose uhm it is either your your choice
of hormonal agents will be either tamoxifen or arimidex either of the two
""
now tamoxifen is the gold standard uhm but it it has side effects
like proneness to  ut  uterine cancer and increased risk of strokes
""
that 's where arimidex would come
""
arimidex is a relatively new drug
""
the studies show now it has a slight advantage over tamoxifen
""
but this is on a short-term basis  pa lang  because
it is a new study
""
we do not know the long-term effect  i mean  the long-term
efficiency as we know of tamoxifen
""
so short of of assuring you that the the response will be
sustained in the next five years i cannot assure you with arimidex
""
but we just know that on a short-term basis it 's better than
tamoxifen  little bit  words 
""
now the second option is for you to undergo chemotherapy
""
i think that is that is the uh option one would take if he really
wants to be ten twenty steps ahead of the whole situation
""
because even in lymph node-negative patients it 's acceptable to
have chemotherapy because of the  probabil  the twenty percent
probability still of recurrence despite you know negative nodes   
""
""
 words  yes just to cover up for deficiency in
the uh the uh assessment tests that we have
""
so as i said it 's the ultimate
""
if you are a person who who wants to use all the biggest bullets
up front that 's the option you take
""
that 's george w bush      they all laugh 
""
 hindi yung talagang    george 
 yung sa kanya yung sigurista siya 
""
i 'm going to do everything now because i 'm gonna win now
""
i 'm not going to wait until later
""
i 'm not very sure if i will win if i will wait later
""
 yan ang  george w bush    
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 uh-uhm  
""
""
 uh  
""
 uh-huh  
""
 negative nodes  
""
 aggressive  
""
  oho   
""
 approach  
""
""
approach okay
""
then the third approach is to sit and to watch
""
and i will not recommend that
""
now in addition to all of this with the point four c m basal line
i 'd go for radiation therapy
""
""
radiation
""
so in addition to hormonal
""
""
to any of those three     i will recommend
radiation     radiation therapy be given to you
""
'cause i 'm not very secure about that
""
""
 yes  
""
 radiation  
""
 ang liit ano 
""
""
it 's too close
""
all in all in all i think you know you you you 're healing very
well
""
""
all right
""
""
so it 's possible doctor to just have hormonal and radiation
""
""
yes that is an open option
""
""
radiation is fixed uh  buti hindi  chemo
""
""
alone alone  gusto mong sabihin 
""
""
hormonal and radiation
""
""
yes
""
""
is that
""
""
that 's acceptable
""
""
that 's acceptable doctor
""
what do i buy with chemo i mean what do i get with chemo
""
""
a slightly higher response rate
""
your your hormone therapy is only at best  mga 
thirty-three thirty-six percent response rate
""
your chemotherapy is about sixty percent
""
""
so i 'll buy fifteen percent
""
and the radiation will uh
""
""
the radiation is more for local control
""
it 's really just a for my i look at it as just a cleaning-up
procedure    
""
you just tidy the place just to be sure   it 's really
clean  na  
""
""
 yes yes  
""
 just to be sure  
""
how long  po yung 
""
""
radiation
""
if you go through chemo you 'll have the radiation after the chemo
""
if you 'll have hormonal therapy up front we can have the
radiation therapy
""
""
the radiation 
""
i have a cousin who 's an oncologist in the u s  doktora
""
""
""
yes  oo 
""
""
so maybe i can write him     and mention all
of these
""
although you know he said exactly  oo  exactly he
mentioned
""
but he said it really depends on uh whether dr chan recommends
chemo
""
i mean it it 's an option he said
""
but definitely he mentioned uh tamoxifen or arimidex   
""
""
and he also mentioned radiation for local recurrence
""
 parehong-pareho ho  so the the question now is
whether i want to undergo chemo
""
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
i i think it 's not your wanting to it 's it 's how how aggressive
you are
""
if you 're a person who 'll do everything now how much fighting
you want to do
""
if if you 're not really all-out to fight  medyo-medyo lang
 fight a little then you know you will do hormonal therapy
""
you you 've gone far enough with surgery already so just that
little more fighting and that 's it for you
""
okay
""
""
how brutal is the chemo    
""
because you said that her two shows it has to be
""
""
 chemo  
""
a stronger chemo
""
""
a stronger chemo
""
""
four cycles of of a c doxorubicin containing  words
 should be fine
""
""
four cycles
""
""
of a c
""
""
of a c
""
 matapang ho yung  a c  ano 
""
""
 hindi naman 
""
 k&aacute;ya naman  because you have all the
support medicines for nausea vomiting
""
""
doctor can i ask the cost
""
""
the cost less than ten thousand per   injection 
yes the a c
""
""
 the chemo  
""
so injection  po yun 
""
i don't have to stay overnight
""
""
no
""
""
doctor what stage is this
""
""
two
""
""
stage two stage two
""
so i have a good chance
""
""
stage two
""
""
yes
""
""
 kasi iyak ako ng iyak 
""
""
 sinasayang mo yung luha mo e 
""
""
so all my baseline data are okay are very good
""
""
okay
""
yes just a few points are
""
if you had to sort them out to good not good  konti lang
yung  not good  mas marami  yung good
""
""
and how soon should the chemo start  doktora 
""
""
we should start the chemo about a month after surgery
""
""
and so two weeks
""
""
so we have two weeks to think about all of these
""
""
if i if i do the chemo i will not do the hormonal or 
sabay ho yun 
""
""
no if you 'll have the chemo chemo  muna 
""
and then we will use the hormonal as a maintenance
""
""
after the cycle
""
""
yes to sustain to sustain you in the next years after
""
""
and then the the radiation comes after the chemo
""
""
yes uh you can have the radiation together with the hormonal
agent
""
""
ahhh okay
""
""
 yun hong  radiation how much is that 
doktora 
""
""
it 's quite expensive
""
  the average is 
""
""
  ilang  sessions  ho yung 
radiation  
""
""
four to five weeks maybe
""
""
four to five days weeks
""
""
four to five four to five
""
sometimes four weeks sometimes five weeks
""
""
how often  yung 
""
every day
""
""
every day
""
""
wow
""
how much  ho yon doktora 
""
""
the average patients spend about seventy thousand pesos
""
""
per
""
""
one seven  she misheard the amount 
""
""
for the whole treatment
""
""
ahh seventy thousand
""
so the chemo is roughly ten thousand per cycle per per
""
""
per session
""
""
i think my insurance can cover that 
""
anything else i need to know
""
""
just  ano 
""
i think that that 's about all
""
i don't think i need
""
how tall are you
""
""
five six five five and a half
""
i have some questions  doktora 
""
about nutrition uh is it normal to feel weak or dizzy
""
sometimes i don't know if it 's psychological i don't know if it 's
""
""
or menopausic symptoms
""
""
 matagal na ho yung  menopause  ko e
""
""
 pero  i still have  parang  hot
flashes i don't know
""
""
it might be menopausic symptoms
""
""
still
""
and then  ano ho yung  what can i eat and not eat
""
""
you can eat anything
""
""
just so that i eat okay
""
""
yes
""
""
and then can i continue taking vitamin supplements  
  and lipitor
""
""
 yes  
""
yes okay
""
""
 yun hong ano  my aunts in the states are
saying you buy immune enhancer  ano  m g n three and all that
""
""
i don't know that  laughs 
""
""
 hindi ho kayo 
""
""
i don't know that
""
it 's not scientific  laughs 
""
""
 hindi ho kayo 
""
""
it 's not scientific
""
""
okay
""
i think those are my questions
""
so anything else so just continue the vitamin supplements
""
""
how much do you weigh now
""
did they weigh you
""
""
a hundred i used to weigh one hundred thirty  parang
 one hundred twenty-five  ngayon 
""
""
 naalis kasi yung  breast
""
""
 yung maliit 
""
""
i should weigh you maybe  weighs the patient 
""
okay
""
""
so the nausea can be controlled  doktora 
""
""
yeah yeah it 's uh
""
""
because i 'm so afraid of the nausea  doktora 
""
""
yes we have good drugs for for nausea and vomiting
""
not a very big problem
""
""
 hindi na kamukha nung dati ano yung  side
effects
""
""
the drugs the anti-vomiting drugs are so efficient
""
""
so i have to let you know in uh  soon
""
""
you have to pray for a decision    
""
it 's not a simple decision
""
""
 yes yes  doktora   
""
but you 're i think you feel that maybe chemo should should be the
best
""
""
 words   si  george w bush
""
""
i don't want to lose a battle
""
""
yes  doktora 
""
""
and you know when you when you fight now i mean your prize is
is a cure
""
if you fight later your prize is only an extension
""
'cause if you wait until recurrence comes recurrence cannot be
cured
""
you just fight and fight
""
""
that 's a very strong point
""
 opo 
""
""
so personally in the situation   you want  you
want a cure
""
then all-out fight you fight now     you fight now
""
""
 bring out the tanks    laughs 
""
  oho oho doktora
