  uh so the term is over   yeah   what are your plans for this summer   yeah this coming april nineteen i 'll teach because uh i 'm given loads by by c s b i 'm given world literature at the same time creative writing i shall be teaching one subject in the morning and then one in the afternoon actually actually the subjects uh should start at eight o'clock in the morning until twelve ten but then i think there 's one english teacher who would like to teach in the morning because she 's pregnant and then she would like to go home in the afternoon to bulacan    uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm   uh so she asked me if we can swap and then i gave the subjects one subject to her the the one in the morning so my schedule is really tough in the sense that i don't like actually the schedule because   one is in the morning and one is in the afternoon     uh uhm yes   in the afternoon uh uhm   so that 's it i 'll be teaching from april nineteen up to may may twelve   that is oh less than a month     laughter three weeks    yeah three weeks     three weeks    well anyway uh that 's uh how how generous you are  really 'no     that 's right that 's the policy of the school because if you are a full-load teacher uh i think that 's only in c s b because in the main i think we have only part-time and full-time   uh-huh   part-time and full-time but in c s b i think we have something in the middle like full-load uh the full-load enjoys also what a full-time teacher enjoys but then what 's the difference the difference lies in uh in one thing when summer comes a full-time teacher doesn't teach but then he gets a salary a full-load doesn't get a salary he has to teach   yeah yeah yeah   and then another advantage of a full-load uhm  compared with ano compared with full with a part-time   with a part-time   is that uh a full-load is given i think an eighteen unit eighteen units eighteen unit load plus three units a part-time can only have up to fifteen units something like that   uh uhm   so of course the salary is higher in terms of salary the salary of a full-time and then a full-load uh teacher between a full-load and uh full-load and a  full-time the salary is the same    full-time  oh the same   the salary is the same uh the difference lies in the number of years of teaching at the same time the qualification academic qualification say if you have a p h d of course you get a higher salary and then if you have stayed in c s b for a number of years then you get also a higher salary   when when does one become a full uh full-time  cough    a full-time it depends on you know the coordinator the what do you call it the chairperson and then there 's another one the director   uh-huh   so the three of them decide and then everything depends on one important thing and that is attitude even though you are a good teacher  and then your academic credentials are really very good if uh you know you don't    uh-huh   uh uhm  your attitude is   you don't you don't follow the c s b mission we 're talking about attitude   uh uhm uh uhm     you know so you can never be a full-time teacher a full-load teacher    so you 're now     so they look into that   so you 're now a full-load teacher   a full-load after two terms because in the first term this is my first year actually in c s b in the first term i was a full i was a part-time teacher   uh-huh   and then in the second term i was a part-time teacher because at the same time i was teaching at university of the east   because i was invited to teach there    uhm  uhm   so the director told me why don't you give it up  and then the second term we 'll give you a full-load status    uhm  uhm   i i told them to give it up but then i think the classes ended uh last last october for the first semester  and then our second trimester started in september    uh uhm   september    so they cannot they were they were not able to grant me the full-load    uh uhm     so they told me you really have to wait for the third term because uh we would like to be sure that you you would give up university of the east so that we can grant you a full-load because that i think that 's the agreement so i was given the full-load in the third trimester    uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm   third trimester and then they are planning to give uh teachers who are full-load uh a full-time status this coming  june    yes this coming june   yeah because according to yeah because according to the president brother dizon there 's no such thing as as full-  load    full-load chuckle    as far as status is concerned we have  only part-time and full-time where did you get this full- load something like that    yeah   full-time   uh uhm  oh yeah oo nga    so he was questioning that when he he went to c s b because he goes there every wednesday and he was questioning dean reyes and the e v p where did you get that full-load i mean did andrew gonzalez know about this    uh uhm  uh uhm   why is it that it 's like this if you follow the la salle system when you talk about the university    uh uhm  yeah   so as part of paascu accreditation which will be this coming july then they have to convert these full-loaders into full-time   uh uhm   uh   uh one hundred percent   no they 혩re still looking into  possibilities because there are some teachers who are not you know in terms of attitude    the attitude   yes  yeah   they 혩re not worthy to be given the status   something like that    uh uhm  uh uhm   because the school is very careful in granting the full-time status to teachers because now in school of multidisciplinary studies uh out of one hundred thirty teachers we 're talking about basic subjects english math uh filipino social studies all these teachers uhm belong to school of multidisciplinary studies uh we call it now as general education program and then we have also another department like management something like that so the biggest department in c s b is the school of multidisciplinary studies so out of one one hundred thirty teachers we have only full-time is four full-time teachers and all of these have problems with attitude   uhm   so the school has really difficult time  how thinking how to get rid of these four people but we cannot because they cannot because they 're full-time something like that    yeah   uh uhm    so when the school grants a full-time status to these teachers who have full-load status they are they 're very careful with that   uh-huh those schools there you have a full- time uh faculty uh that uh who are not yet permanent   uh those full-time faculty those four full- time faculty members are permanent already   permanent already    oo they 혩re permanent already   what attitudes for instance    one is the faculty association president but then it seems that he doesn't he doesn't uh he doesn't protect the interest of the faculty like take for example during the promotion the promotion uh the meeting of the board for the promotion of teachers   uh uhm   he always goes against these teachers who are promoted like for example   uhm   i was nominated before to be promoted to be given the full-load status together with other four english teachers he questioned that i mean you are a faculty president    uh uhm  yeah   faculty association president you should you should protect the interest of the faculty you should defend your  support the the faculty members for promotion why is it that you are like that    support   uh uhm    so people a i mean teachers were actually questioning him why is it that it 's like that telephone rings  at the same time other four full-time uh faculty teachers who are hold who are also officers of the faculty association   uh uhm   and every time every time the school decides oh the plan is like this the plan is like that they always go against with the plan    uh uhm  uhm   so   and why like that   the school cannot remove them the the school can't get rid of them because they 're permanent   yeah   so   very difficult 'no     so i think last month uh there was a news that that they would like to go to united states as tourists something like that   that 혩s the president   the four of them the four of them   wait a minute are they all officers wait are they word   they are all officers of the faculty association   oh    oo something like that one is president the other is secretary   uh uhm   because uh i think the policy the policy in the the faculty association is that you cannot become a president you should be a full-time faculty in order to become a president if you want to hold a major position like secretary auditor so you should be a full-time teacher so the positions they they get all the positions  so i think they feel that the school doesn't like them   uh uhm   and then many last month many were applying for abroad   uh uhm   so uh they asked for what do you call this they asked for certification what do you call that certification of employment that they are permanent teachers at c s b so that when you present this paper to the embassy you will be granted the visa tourist visa    uh uhm    because if you are permanent in a certain school like for example c s b or any private schools     uh uhm    then you will come back because you are   permanent     uh uhm    because you may you really have to serve the school something like that  so they asked for that and then dr reyes said why not give them the letters they like i mean they want whatever letters they they want so that they can go out of school because we know that they will not come back anymore because that 's united states of america   and that the purpose of going there is not only to to see america but to stay there and work that 's one way t n t acronym for tagalog slang to stay on as an illegal alien so when the dean heard that from the human resource management uh in-charge and then she told she told him give them the letter    uh uhm   and then  uh uhm and then let them go   let them go if they will not come back then that 's okay   when are they planning to go   but we heard that uh the visa was not approved they were not granted visa because it 혩s difficult to go to the united states right now because of the v f a because of the v f a  so that 's that 's life in c s b so i 'll be teaching     usually how long does it does it take for a full-loader 'no a full-load faculty to become a full-time   full-time uh usually one year uh the reason why they were questioning us the four of us uh the four of us from the english department because this is our first year i mean if you are a new teacher you have to wait for one year you have to finish your one year and then you 'll be granted the full- load status but why is it that after after the first trimester why is it the school was eager to to give us the status because in preparation for the paascu that was the reason and then they see they saw that time that we deserved to be to be given the the status it was not stated in the faculty manual actually but uh but they claimed that why is it that in our case before i mean we waited for two years three years and then we were granted the full-time and full-load status why is it that these new teachers are are are given the the status it 's uh unfair on the part of those who have stayed here for a number of years so they were questioning that but then they cannot do anything at all because uh the school decided for that
