""
""
oh really
""
""
and you know the l c d didnt work
""

around nine   nine or  ten to just compress around the laptop
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
uh-huh
""
""
and then they were they were actually craning just to see the
the screen   okay 
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
so they had difficulty   looking at  your visuals
""
""
 yeah   true true
""
but at least they enjoyed
""

""
""
 yeah well dear   you 're a total performer
""
""
oh thank you dear
""
  anyway 
""
""

""
""
and so that 's why at this very moment i i 'm so exhausted
""
i really wanna eat or wind up or go somewhere

""

""
""
oh what about uh robinson 's uh cinnzeo
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

cinnamon
""
wow
""
""
yeah the butter   and the chocolate  the nuts
""
""
 and the butter  
""
and  the  and then while while drinking coffee we 'll talk
about semantics  giggle 
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
and pragmatics
""
""
yeah your presentation about semantics
""
""
yeah uhm okay you know what 's that
""
i wanna i wanna  wa  watch a film but oh my god it 's what
's this it 's still metro manila week right
""
""
yeah it 's the manila film fest
""
""
uh the manila film festival
""
""
yeah
""
""
and no english films being shown
""
""
 nada  none
""
""
 ha 
""
so of course i wouldnt watch volta or whatever
""
""
 chuckle  but i heard it 's the top grosser so far
""
""
which one volta
""
""
yeah volta
""
""
oh  okay so pathetic
""
anyway uhm  hey uhm speaking about films which reminds me you
know what i i where where did i see that
""
i think it 's in the internet i i i read something like a review of
the troy the movie
""
remember that brad pitt troy
""
""
yeah yeah i 've watched it too
""
""
oh but of course
""
i was a bit confused with the you know uhm the introduction or
something about troy actually the background
""
perhaps you can shed light you know you 're the authority here when
it comes to literature
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
uh-hmmmh uh
""
""
well actually that movie is a compressed version of different
literary works
""
""
what what different
""
you mean it was not only based from iliad
""
""
no the iliad talks about the tenth year of the war up to the
death of hector
""
""
oh oh
""
that 's something new huh
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
but even prior to that there were already works that pertained
to the gods the goddesses and the heroes of troy and greece
""
""
uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh
""
""
maybe what the producers of the movie troy did was they
compressed everything into a single commercialized film with a romantic plot
and all the works
""
""
oh yes oh yes
""
""
 words  to impress viewers so they would
enjoy it
""
""
uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh
""
""
and there were a lot of differences    words
 
""
""
 yeah actually   there were a lot of what 
differences okay
""
well what i know only is the iliad
""
i i dont know the one you were telling me is that it was based
from many works so aside from iliad
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
uhm so what there were there are some confusing parts there
like uh uh a lot of them were able to escape from troy is that true
""
""
no that 's not true because
""
""
isnt it it 's only  ae  what 's that aeneas right
""
""
aeneas
""
""
yeah
""
""
the father and his son were the only men who escaped from
troy
""
""
that 's according to iliad
""
""
no no not that 's not in the iliad
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
the later work by a greek poet
""
""
oh i see
""
but according to iliad it was only aeneas who was able to escape
right
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
the women they were the women they all became concubines of
the greeks
""
""
oh briseis
""
briseis became also a concubine you mean
""
""
briseis
""
""
briseis
""
""
i forgot
""
""
the love interest of of achilles achilles
""
""
uh
""
""
did she die  at the end i dont remember anymore
""
uh briseis
""
""
in the movie she didnt die
""
""
uh-hmmmh she escaped right
""
""
yeah she was able to escape     the pillaging of
the  troo  of the greeks
""
but in the in greek literature i forgot what happened to her
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
oh i see okay and what what else
""
uhm who who is now the character of legolas
""
what was the character being
""
""
paris
""
""
paris paris what about paris
""
wasnt that the start actually the start of the troy like uhm of
course he abducted helen right
""
""
he abducted helen and uh took her to troy
""
""
yeah
""
was it was it like that in in iliad
""
""
yeah it was also like that
""
""
no because in the film i remember in the film uh uh like uh
paris and helen were like romantically linked right
""
but in the original version in iliad helen was actually given to
paris as a gift
""
""
oh yeah   by  aphrodite
""
""
 yeah  
""
by aphrodite
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay or or what 's this it 's not actually a gift or a bribe
 for choosing her as the
""
""
for choosing her as the most
""
""
as the fairest woman
""
""
yeah her  words  hera and athena
""
""
yeah athena
""
but in the film okay uhm it it looks like paris and helen had what
had an affair an illicit affair and so
""
""
yeah because in the  in greek literature when paris came
to  sparta
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
menelaus wasnt there so he had the chance to abduct helen
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
but in the movie he saw there menelaus   and hector
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
they were all in sparta but actually it 's not true
""
""
oh
""
""
it didnt really happen
""
""
oh i see
""
okay uhm another part in the film that which i enjoyed not really
i enjoyed or which i remember
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
based from the iliad is the fight between hector and achilles
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
how did you find that
""
""
yeah
""
""
that   was sexy right 
""
""
 it 's a very realistic   portrayal
""
""
what about the what about the performance of achilles there
like or or achilles or he was he was kinda dancing
""
""
yeah they were like dancing flamingoes  chuckle 
""
""
okay it was like what
""
""
it was like a choreographed fight
""
""
a choreographed fight
""
i i was supposed to say that  a choreographed fight
""
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
uh-huh okay
""
and then in the original version achilles was supposed to drag the
body of hector inside uh troy right inside the walls of troy right
""
""
no it was uh when patroclus was killed by hector they created
a funeral pyre for him
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
and then when achilles killed hector he dragged
""
""
the body of
""
""
the body to their camp to the greek camp
""
""
that 's already in the film but in the original version
around troy
""
""
no no not around troy
""
""
around the walls
""
""
dragged hector 's body around patroclus ' funeral fire
""
""
oh i   see 
""
""
 funeral   pyre for eleven days
""
""
i see i see
""
okay uh-huh
""
but originally i mean did the did the father of  priam did king
priam really retrieve the body of hector in the original version
""
""
he was able to go to the greek camps because hermes helped
them hermes is the messenger of the gods
""
""
yeah yeah hermes of course i remember
""
""
yeah he was able to cloak priam
""
""
oh
""
""
 disguise him so  he was able to go to achilles ' camp
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
but in the movie the gods were absent none of them were there
""
""
yes yes yes which makes the movie realistic right
""
okay because there were no gods or or goddesses in the film right
""
there  wa  there was a uh mention of it okay but just a
mention right
""
they didnt appear
""
""
that 's the liberty of the director to do what he wants so
that the movie will be commercially viable
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
oh true uhm okay so that 's all about troy
""
i 'm waiting actually for the spiderman two
""
""
i am waiting for that one   too 
""
""
 oh   what about uh watching it together or with
tina perhaps what about that
""
""
oh sure
""
""
uhm
""
""
i 'm sure we 'll enjoy watching it
""
""
well that is of course if we dont have assignment in our
subjects or   if i wont be preparing 
""
""
 or we have no paper to check  
""
""
yeah no paper to check or if we have no reports or no
research work you know
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""

""
i still have what i still have one report to do in semantics
""
i still have to do a paper in corpus
""
oh i cant afford to read anymore book five of harry potter 
 although i really want to 
""
""
 so reading for you   has become   reading
 has become a luxury for you
""
""
 harry potter is  
""
oh yeah yeah  chuckle 
""
i do it while i 'm in the bus you know
