good evening welcome to points of view  i 'm teddy locsin junior and i 'm cher calvin i 'm jessica zafra tonight 's episode was inspired by e-mail from one of our viewers sari monteclaro who suggested that we tackle comm uh consumer rights at some point we all have experienced bad service or bought shabbily made products but how many times have we ever asserted our consumer rights i know i do and for this i 'm you know referred to as some kind of bella flores complaining all the time and if the stories are true then i have ingested spit from every single waiter in metro manila whose service i 've complained about now do we have consumer rights in the philippines how many of us are aware of this and do we actually assert these rights and also given that mo most of the employees in stores and in restaurants aren't real employees but casual employees who expect to lose their jobs within the space of a few months have we got a right to expect good service well uhm i don't know if we have really a law uhm defining consumer rights but i do know that just on the law of contracts if you don't get what you pay for you should theoretically be able to uh uhm get back your money uh uhm or or or change it for something better something that suits more the object that you wanted to have uh-hmmmh but uhm i don't know my own experience is i never complain the people like me for that and i guess that 's the price i pay living with the satisfaction and keeping it bottled up inside   maybe complaining is more of a girl thing 'cause i   i definitely complain a lot you know   uh uhm  but i i try clears throat i try not to complain too much at the restaurants you know whatever but because of ingesting other people 's spit and so forth you know speaker c laughs  i 'll wait until you know but then then we also have a guest who was saying earlier when we were uh getting ready for the show that he was he 's found guest uh guests in his restaurant the customers in his restaurant that will complain after you know their eating so i guess i shouldn't do that either right   uh uhm  uhm but i i don't know i think that i i think that as a customer we do especially in restaurants have def definitely deserve the best kind of service that you can get i mean if like my plate is done it should be removed right away you know those kind of things whether you are in a five star restaurant or in a two star restaurant uh uhm those are like just things i i expect to happen right and they don't and it 's kind of frustrating when you 're raising your hand up and no one is even paying attention to you at all and they 're all in the back making kuwento  i know you know that 's a little frustrating as well but then another thing that kind of also irks me is that there are a lot of uhm i 've got a lot to complain about laughter  it 's really a girl thing laughter  it really is a girl thing is that when you buy products and then they 're refurbished you know what i mean you 'll go to like uhm whatever whatever place and buy like a cellphone or whatever and then you get something that you paid for uhm like it 's supposed to be made in finland right and then when you get home and and you really check it out or a couple of weeks later you you 're how come it 's broken already  and then you don't you can't do anything about it at all  uh uhm  there goes ten thousand p you know ten thousand pesos on a telephone for example right   uh uhm and october is consumer rights month uh uhm which which brings us to uhm something i learned recently that there is no such thing as no return no exchange right even in the philippines and yet have you actually tried to exchange a product the few times that i 've tried to exchange clothes that i 've bought everybody just just looks at me as if i 'm some kind of freak which i am but they have no right to look at me as if i were a freak laughter  and then they 'll they 'll try to find something wrong with the product that they can blame on you so that they don't have to re to exchange it with anything   uh uhm  but i think you know the the worry is there is that if they give in to you word will get around and people will abuse but you know uhm uhm i mean i hate to make comparisons again but i think americans are known to abuse but they 've lived with that the system has accommodated it and the result is better service they just gotta charge it to experience or raise their costs but uhm taking it back and substituting it for something better uhm has ma made shopping a joy there yeah oh that 's what i mean even when you buy gifts you know they 've got in in the states or whatever i was i just received the gift that i got like a receipt a gif a gift receipt if in case i didn't like the present i could go and it doesn't matter what the price or anything because i won't know  you can exchange it for something you like  but but there is one one area where we have this exchange policy that 's wedding gifts uh uhm almost everywhere the gift is assumed it 'll go back to uh the department store and exchanged for something else  uh uhm  will they give you cash i think they do  i think they give you gift certificates   i think  well more of our complaints questions and suggestions about con consumer rights when we come back commercial break  now you can move goods faster electronically you can buy stuff on the computer i guess 'no  and uhm you think that the digital revolution the computer revolution has well made buying and selling so much better so much more convenient but has it really made the customer king that 's the adage of department stores restaurants throughout the ages is the customer king now uh uhm okay well let 's find out from our guests what they think if the customer is king or not and joining us is andrew masigan and he 's the owner of struan and tang 's and he thinks that filipinos are very vocal in their complaints and difficult to please also joining us is deedee sytangco she 's a spokesperson of former president coraz corazon aquino and writes for the manila bulletin  and as a consumer she believes that uh the consumer is king and thus always right until proven wrong uhm also joining us is maurice orosa and he used you used to own a restaurant right and he thinks that the consumer is oftentimes right but not always uh and then allan coronel director studio twenty-three creative sales doesn't think that customers are always right you guys kind of agree huh uhm but he doesn't want to be shortchanged for what he paid for okay welcome to the show okay i i heard that one of you had stutter one of your wives uh wife of one of you laughter had this experience with a caterpillar on the salad which goes to show just how fresh it was laughter  yikes that was my wife we were eating and she ordered uh caesar 's salad caesar 's salad came in and my son goes mom there 's something crawling uh it was green it 's caesar it was a caterpillar i guess it wasn't part of the sauce did you complain right away we did and then they changed it  referring to speaker e but but you found out that in some of your customers have inserted things into their food right  well yeah  yeah like glass  do they really do it   well it does happen  it does happen and uhm the thing is uh there is some malicious intent to extort money uh-huh uh if they do it intentionally but uh going back to your case referring to speaker d if if it does happen uh like let 's say in struan and tang 's tea salon if uh not to say that it did happen but if it does happen uh the the first thing that the first thing to do is immediately to replace the product and in our case we give the we give the item uh complimentary you know what though i 'd be kind of grossed out like already having eaten that uh caesar 's salad and there was a caterpillar in it  yeah   true   yeah  i mean what 's to say there isn't more caterpillars in that   yeah   no but you see true caesar 's salad but you see cher for a for a you know for for the client uh uhm for the customer you know i may be i may be proven you know right that oh there 's something in my salad and all that but as long as the owner of the restaurant is pleasant and agreeable you know  2 words   3 words like you know   and says don't worry laughter we only have just one caterpillar you won't get more caterpillars laughter  i mean if he 's not if he doesn't become disagreeable and say you 've eaten half your salad and how do i know if you 've brought in the caterpillar etcetera etcetera  uh uhm  3 words laughter  you know i would not really you know as a customer i will not but there are other instances when you 're returning a product to the department store and it 's clearly you know a lemon defective yeah defective and then they 'll say no etcetera etcetera  now that i which is what to my point i say that if you are a if you want to be a good uh if you want to have uh value for your money you must first know what are your rights uh uhm okay   because that 's consumer we 're all consumers we must know what what is our responsibility and what is our right you know does that mean that that the no exchange the no exchange no return is that is that really are they allowed to do that i don't think so i think the we have a consumer act but i don't think like i know some a very well known wine store that has a big big uh sign you know wines purchased in this deli you cannot return   sign  but you know what that 's wrong that 's wrong because i mean you can get a whole case of wine  that 's not right that 's not right  yeah that 's you know bad and sour   because you have to return at least i mean the bottle yeah the bottle yeah and then give your opinion and then don't come   then just think of  teddy boy don't come back in six months at least i mean uh of course i mean at least six months laughter  you know don't i mean it 's really you drink it you know at night you open the red wine and it 's really patis  then return it the next day laughter  but i agree i agree with the but i think you 'll find that people will complain will not complain about small things that don't cost much like like me i never complain but when it 's something really bigger oh yeah like an air conditioner oh well that 's really when i 'm gonna say i 'm gonna burn down your store laughter   sure i mean  teddy  you get my point is you you get what you pay for let 's say you go to a two star restaurant or you go to a place just right beside of at the side of the road  you do   you get what you   you get two star food  oh well of course of course yeah  you know  so you can't demand the best service or the best products in in such a place no but andrew it 's relative to if if you went to uh a fast food chain of course you won't expect five you know five star service and all that  correct  yeah but you expect that the food is edible
