so it is now appropriate for the weekend it is going now to be a weekend that you will be doing some more in statistics are you ready okay take this down the following data the following data are the ages the following data are the ages of a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in the united states and a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in western europe  you got it 'no  alright let me repeat  the following data are the ages of a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in the united states and a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in western europe  now let me write the data on the board the teacher writes on the board  the different data that refer to the ages of drivers in the united states and in western europe okay the requirements you ready for the requirements  the students answer in chorus not yet  alright finished class okay now what you should be doing is you 're going to discuss the findings of the data that you have okay you have the data representing the ages of uh sales people in the united states and in eu in western europe so you are going to display the data separately by a words  second you have to calculate the mean the median the first quartile the third quartile the range the inter-quartile range and the coefficient of variation these will be discussed today number three the shape of the distribution whether it is negatively skewed positively skewed and then number four discuss the findings how do you discuss the findings you are going to compare the uh the two data sets the ages of u s drivers versus the ages of western europe is the homework clear alright so for today we are going to discuss the measures of variation because we finished measures of central tendency last wednesday both for the uh grouped and the ungrouped data you recall that we calculated the mean the median the teacher writes on the board uh the mode for both grouped and ungrouped data okay now tell me what 's the difference between grouped and ungrouped data what is the difference between grouped and ungrouped data susan uhm grouped data are characterized by words like for example you have words  alright by grouped data we mean data that are arranged into a what frequency distribution by frequency distribution we arrange the data according to categories or classes and then we tally the number of variables or the number of values that would be included in that particular class okay so now we said last wednesday also that if we will only be dealing with measures of central tendency some problems may come up like the problem on employee a and employee b wherein both have the same average uh performance but if you look at the variability of each value then you would know that one employee is better than the other employee why because we looked at the uh dispersion or the spread of the scores from a point of reference called the mean the point of reference class may not only be the mean it could also be the median or the mode but the usual procedure is to compare every value from the mean okay now let 's begin the measures of variation or variability alright the first and the simplest is the range here alright let me see i will add oh here is the range the first measure of variability is the range if you 're given a set of scores class immediately you calculate the range what is the range somebody in the class answers but is inaudible  highest minus lowest very good  the teacher writes on the board x highest minus x lowest it is the distance of the highest score from the lowest or vice versa how far away is the highest from the lowest so that if i have case a let us say this is one class the highest score here let us say is a hundred the lowest score is ninety-five or let 's say ninety so what is the range the range is  the students answer in chorus ten  i have another case b  the teacher writes on the board the highest score is ten the lowest score is zero  ten what is the range the range is also ten i have case c alright the highest score is a hundred the lowest score is zero what is the range  the students answer in chorus one hundred  one hundred okay now we have three groups of students here we have three classes we said the highest in case a is a hundred the lowest is ninety the range is ten in case b the highest is ten the lowest is zero range is ten in case c highest is a hundred lowest is zero the range is a hundred now can you have a description of the abilities of the classes here yes manuel describe to me the three classes uh case a and b case a uh the variable of uh more or or less pareho lang words  so that more or less the students are of the same ability case what about case b are we not going to discuss case b for case a case b pareho lang ang average nilang lahat pare-pareho lang ah maliliit ang difference nila eh pero whereas case c word case b mabababa   whereas case a words case b mabababa uhm so therefore sa isang range equal walang masyadong words  oh continue manuel what uh what can you conclude from the range you 're saying that in case a the abilities of the students are about the same as well as case b the abilities of the students are also about the same what about case c the abilities of the students are what varied are varied right class varied you have a very bright kid and you have i will not say it any more laughter  now in other words this group is a variable group the variability is so large the larger the range the more variable is the group do you understand the smaller the range the less variable is the group the more similar is the group that is why if we are going to describe case a and case b we have a homogeneous group a homogeneous group same ability group same ability in case c we have a heterogeneous group heterogeneous group so that if you are given only the range you are given an information about the variability of the class or of the group is this clear uh is this clear so that 's the simplest but the range class only depends on two values on the highest and the lowest you really don't know how the values in between vary that is the limitation do you understand the limitation of the range is is that you would not know how the values between the highest and the lowest va vary so if this is your highest and this is your lowest you know the distance you know the spread of the highest versus the lowest but the the scores the teacher taps on the board in between you don't know this is the limitation that 's why we have to go farther down let 's go to a measure of dispersion which is the variance let us go immediately to the variance number three the standard deviation and number four the coefficient of variation these are the four okay now the inter-quartile range is defined as is also one of the measures inter-quartile range now we to okay up third quartile right so q three minus we also to okay up first quartile right minus first quartile this is your inter-quartile range it is a measure of uh variability because if we ever say this is your normal curve this is your q two this is your q one this is your q three it is really q three minus q one this is really your inter-quartile range q three minus q one do you understand so let me repeat that this is q two the median first quartile third quartile inter-quartile range is q three minus q one so in other words this is the the inter-quartile range okay now but we will not emphasize on that we will emphasize on two three and four we will focus our attention on two three and four the variance standard deviation and coefficient of variation alright  let me begin by a very simple example alright let 's say the teacher writes on the board let 's say we have a small department store and uh we are going to record the sales the daily sale of this small store let 's pick one item and the item is the designer jean alright let us record the daily sale of the designer jean of this particular store let 's say on monday this store sold one pair only of designer jean on tuesday two pairs on wednesday three on thursday four on friday five you know there are other items also but we are only concentrating on one specific item that is the designer jean so if we take the average sale of this particular unit what is our daily average daily sale how many  the students answer in chorus three  three so how do you get the mean so we take the summation of x the teacher writes on the board three six ten fifteen summation x divided by n or fifteen divided by five is three average daily sale is three three pairs of designer jean now if i want to know how each day is doing each day 's sale is doing in comparison to the average i am going to take the deviation from the mean right so that let us prepare another column which is x minus x bar what am i doing here i want to compare monday 's sale with the average daily sale on monday they sold only one design one pair of designer jean and if you compare it with the average monday 's sale is below the average by how many pairs  the students answer in chorus two  by two because you sold two pairs below the average you have a negative deviation right this is actually one minus three this is x is one x bar is three one minus three so you would have a negative deviation minus two because you have a negative deviation we want to make this positive how do we make a negative positive in algebra  the students answer in chorus taking the absolute value  taking the absolute value or squaring right how do you how do you get rid of a negative value in algebra take the absolute absolute value or another way is by squaring so let us square the deviation from the mean so that minus two becomes now plus four the actual deviation is really two two below because you sold only one pair and the average is three pairs so one minus three is minus two but we don't want to handle negative deviations we want to get rid of the negative sign so we are going to square and squaring a negative means positive four minus two becomes positive four now you say this store sold two pairs and if you compare this with the average this is now two minus three square and this will give us one plus one on wednesday the store sold exactly equal to the average you hit the average on wednesday so this is three minus three square and this is zero deviation on thursday the store sold four pairs and the average is three therefore you have your one pair above the average on thursday alright so we compare four minus three square this is one and on friday we sold how many five pairs and the average daily sale is three so that what is the deviation from the mean inaudible answer  two pairs right above square that becomes five this is now five minus three square becomes four now do you know what is happening on this column here yes or no you know what is going on here what is going on here ms viduya what are we doing here we 're getting the deviation from each other in other words we have some pairings every single daily sale with the average daily sale in in statistics usage we 're taking the deviation from the mean but that is really very technical if you want it to put it in ordinary language we 're really comparing every single value every daily sale with the average daily sale this is in ordinary language in statistics we 're saying we 're taking the deviation from the mean but sometimes other people will not understand that what are what are they doing if they they they 're taking the deviation from the mean we 're actually comparing every single value this is the sale from the average daily sale that makes it more meaningful to you right
