okay so today we will perform qualitative analysis  writes
on board  of elements  writes on board 
""
from the title of the experiment you can already predict what sort
of tests we will carry out for today
""
so basically we would like to check what elements are present in the
given substance in the sample solution
""
okay since we are talking about organic compounds so expect that
these compounds contain the element carbon and of course hydrogen
""
but also remember that organic molecules sometimes  con 
contains uh contain nitrogen sometimes oxygen sometimes the halogens okay
""
so we would like to check whether they are present or not
""
so what you will be given is a sample solution containing all those
elements okay
""
so you are given a sample solution containing all those  e 
elements and then you will test them for the different elements so naturally
you will always get positive results
""
so for example if you test the substance for nitrogen you can carry
out that particular test observe see what happens in the reaction okay and be
how do you call this uh pay particular attention with regards to the
formation of precipitates whether there is a change in the color of solution
or not whether there are bubbles that form in the reaction and so on and so
forth
""
okay
""
so when you test for nitrogen and knowing that your sample solution
contains nitrogen then those are the positive results
""
later on you will be given an unknown solution and that unknown
solution may contain maybe three maybe four maybe five elements we don't know
okay
""
so based on your sample solution containing all the elements you
will base the results for the unknown solution
""
is that clear
""
so you have a  pa  sample solution uh containing all those
elements and an unknown you don't know what uh it contains
""
now you have read the procedure any question about that
""
so we will basically just mix uh chemicals reagents and observe
what happens afterwards
""
at the end of the experiment i do not expect you to immediately
come up with a chemical equation to explain what happened in the test okay
""
you have to do some uh literature search to find out what
particular reaction took place uh in a certain test okay
""
so that will be for next meeting but for day for today i will just
ask you to come up with the different observations for each test okay
""
some techniques that you should know
""
if you are asked to test for acidity of the solution for example we
will use a litmus paper for that and you must observe the proper technique in
doing so
""
you do not put the litmus paper inside the test tube for example
you don't do that
""
what you need to do is to dip the stirring rod in the solution and
touch the litmus paper and see whether there is a color change again
""
if there is a change in the color of the litmus paper from red to
blue for example and that the blue litmus paper remains blue then it means
that you have a basic solution
""
if for example your red litmus paper becomes how do you call this
which one okay and then the red remains red then you have an acidic solution
""
okay now if you will look at our solvents and reagents given here
each bottle have its own  o  has its own dropper okay
""
do not interchange the droppers otherwise some of the reagents will
react with one another and it will be contaminated and uh you will always get
wrong results okay
""
so be careful about that
""
what else
""
be careful with the sodium metal why  sodium metal
""
so extra care in handling sodium metal because it reacts violently
with water in other words don't  e  don't try to touch it because
again your your your hands have moisture and that uh it violently reacts with
it so be careful with the sodium metal
""
okay any question
""
question
""
clarification about the procedure
""
 walang katanungan ( chuckles) wala  meron bang hindi
naintindihan malabo sa nabasa nyong  procedure  wala

okay you may start doing the experiment
