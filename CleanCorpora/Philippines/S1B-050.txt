""
""
and welcome back to the  philippine times 
""
joining us on the floor this morning acting defense secretary eduardo ermita
""
secretary good morning
""
thanks for joining us today
""
""
uh good morning karmina
""
good morning dan
""
""
good morning   sir 
""
""
 okay   government has already sent uh two envoys to the netherlands
""
that 's uh agrarian reform secretary hernani braganza and former justice secretary silvestre bello to talk with founding c p p a chairman jose maria sison
""
do we have any news from the two envoys
""
""
well uh you know actually the trip of uh chairman uh of the panel atty silvestre bello     uh was done uh after a uh i understand a conversation over the phone with joma sison immediately after joma sison in the netherlands found out that the uh atty silvestre bello had been designated officially
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
he was asked that maybe you can come over so that we can talk of how to get started  1 word 
""
""
so you see that as an indication that uh things might just go well because uh jose maria sison liked the appointment of secretary bello as the head of the panel
""
""
indeed karmina
""
as a matter of fact yesterday we got a copy of the uh official press statement made by joma sison     in the netherlands among others reiterating his congratulations uh to president gloria macapagal-arroyo for having adopted this  2 words  policy of uh constructive peace process     against the war policy of the past administration
""
and he he specifically mentioned in his press statement that he welcomed the designation of atty   silvestre  bello and for that matter including secretary nani braganza because uh they uh he knows that these people have correct credentials and uh correct competence to be able to deal with the issues at hand
""
""
 right  
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
 uh uhm  
""
okay so with these positive developments that are happening now as far as uh moving back to the uh negotiating table uh when are we going to see uh these gentlemen sit down again and talk peace
""
there are uh reports coming out that joe maria sison is actually waiting first for the number of political prisoners that would be released
""
is this going to be an all or nothing thing
""
or maybe say half and then we 'll talk
""
what is the situation in this area
""
""
let 's just say uh dan that uh the matter of uh the issue of the release of the so-called political prisoners     uh are activities that will  3 words  of the panel in the effort to restart or resume the uh talks
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
in the next few days hopefully within a day or two we hope to be able to get news from uh secretary former secretary bello because i understand he 's coming back he 's not staying very long
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
the important thing is he should be able to set the tone of the uh agenda and set the uh timetable
""
and find out from the n d f when the group of fr jalandoni who was designated chair of the n d f negotiators will be coming to the philippines to be able to start the talks here in the philippines
""
""
so we will really be uh looking forward to this   uh  report when he comes back
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
  yes  uh we are confident that uh we 'll be getting a positive uh report from uh bebot bello
""
""
 uhm  
""
okay so secretary we are not looking at a quota here as far as the the political prisoners to be released are concerned
""
""
not necessarily
""
uh they claim that there are more than two hundred
""
but since the time of former president ramos there have been uh so-called or alleged political offenders who have been released
""
now uh as i said the administration of president gloria macapagal-arroyo did what it 's doing not because it is the demand of the other side but because uh we feel that by doing so we 'll be able to uh prepare the ground uh conducive to the resumption of talks
""
""
early into her administration the president uh stressed that she would like for jose maria sison to come home
""
is this part of the exploratory talks now going on between former secretary bello and secretary braganza
""
""
uh yes
""
it 's very possible
""
as a matter of fact even about a week or so ago i already mentioned that uh should the chairman uh choose to come home he is welcome
""
as a matter of fact we are going to do our part by uh implementing the so-called  joint agreement on safety and uh immunity guarantees  jasig which had been agreed upon before
 so with the current atmosphere i am very confident that uh the leadership of the n d f will consider coming home so that we could talk about the problems besetting our people here in our country
""
""
uh uhm
""
sir in another uh front as far as negotiations are concerned it seems that now with the c p p n p a there 's uh again the the light at the end of the tunnel is getting bigger and bigger for all of us
""
uh what is now happening on the other side of the fence here in the philippines with the m i l f
""
""
well uh we also have very positive signs   uh  dan
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
uh about a week ago we received a letter coming from uh atty  jilalan  ali one of the uh negotiators of the m i l f     who mentioned that uh chairman hashim salamat of the  moro  islamic liberation front also welcomed the uh uh new policy adopted by president gloria macapagal-arroyo
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
and the m i l f leadership also welcomed the moves such as the suspension of defensive military operations against the m i l f  the move right now of the president of having created an inter-agency committee for mindanao that will attend to the relief and rehabilitation of work especially on the return of evacuees to their uh places of uh   original  uh residence
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
right
""
""
and at the same time welcomed the move that uh you read in the papers that the uh government had already withdrawn even the warrant of arrest that was issued before by uh by the former chief p n p on uh chairman salamat muhrad jafar and other members or leadership of the m i l f     in connection with the uh coming chief p n p
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
that 's right
""
""
so uh these are all uh very nice uh confidence-building measures
""
""
  uh uhm 
""
""
 that   we hope would be responded to by the m i l f by announcing   the  membership of their panel that will talk to the government panel
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
now uhm in a recent interview that we had with atty ed kabalu the spokesperson of uh the m i l f they he was saying that uh to that date when we were talking to him there was still no uh black and white uh information coming from the g r p or the government regarding these uh conditions to set uh the meeting once again
""
uh have we already forwarded uh something in black and white
""
""
yes we did uh
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
you recall about a week ago     i mentioned the letter of uh from atty  jilalan  ali uh that was in response to the letter     in black and white sent by uh chairman jess dureza   chair  of our panel dated february fifteen
""
apparently uh their so-called spokesman ed kabalu didn't know this but there was already an invitation sent by uh jess dureza
""
so we are uh we know that uh they already know the official position taken by government to be able to resume the talks
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
 i see  
""
 okay  
""
okay
""
""
i think it was in the same conversation that we had with spokesperson kabalu that he said that he was kind of disappointed because of what the president said about that particular issue of the return of territory to the m i l f
""
he said that uhm once we go uh and meet again on the negotiating table that there should be no pre-conditions set
""
and then uh the president came out on national t v and said that uh she is sad to say uh she is saddened by the fact that there will be no return of territory to the m i l f
""
has that particular stand been compromised already
""
""
well it 's possible that that was the decision or statement taken by uh mr ed kabalu at that time
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but as i said the last letter uh the much later uh communication we got from the other camp was that they welcomed the  words  of president macapagal-arroyo especially when the suspension of the military operations was announced and that uh hand in hand with the negotiation is the rehabilitation and development effort
 so uh we are saying that we hope that uh while government is doing everything to prepare the ground conducive to a good resumption of peace   peace  talks we hope that uh the m i l f will already uh compose their panel and our panel and their panel could talk of   those things  including the agenda items as well as the timetable that they should follow to be able to move forward in this process
  uh uhm  
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
okay  mentio  you mentioned uh the word  timetable  there
""
uhm do you do are we following anything as far as  break  breakthroughs uhm are concerned
""
because we very well know that the may elections is coming up and this might just be one of the campaign issues uhm in the on the campaign trail
""
""
well you know karmina uh our chairman jess dureza is in mindanao and uh as a matter of fact is in constant contact with the other side
""
and that 's why i said that uh if the other side m i l f had to form or could form their panel then uh on the ground that they 'll be able to discuss exactly when they should start but the timetable for  words  has started because of all these initiatives taken unilaterally by the government
""
and i hope that the other side will respond accordingly
""
""
okay sir i just want to clarify if in the letter of atty  jilalan  ali did they still uh mention the fact that they would want the negotiations to happen outside the country
""
""
uh there was no such mention
""
""
  uh uhm 
""
""
 but you   know dan uh i think that was what they were saying before
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but the question i 'm gonna ask is  supposing uh that is under consideration what country do you think or has there been any country uh member of the o i c that has volunteered to say yes     we are welcome to uh such a suggestion
""
uh unlike in our negotiations with the talks with the m n l f in the nineteen   ninety-four  to nineteen ninety-six you will recall that the m n l f being a  word  observer status in the o i c     uh was handled in such a way that uh a committee of six headed by uh indonesia became the uh chair     of the negotiations the talks of which were held in jakarta
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
 uh uhm  
""
 that 's right  
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
and that was a voluntary act on the part of indonesia to uh allow themselves be the venue and play the host  not clear, could also be  pay the cost  
""
""
uh uhm that 's   right 
""
""
 so   the question we have to ask will be number one i think the m i l f is not uh officially recognized by the o i c like the recognition of islamic   m n l f 
""
""
 m n l   f
""
""
they are looked upon as one entity
""
number two there is no volunteer uh on the part of the other members of the o i c member countries composed of seven this time which includes brunei
""
""
uh uhm
""
to present themselves as the venue
""
""
to present themselves as the venue
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
so i think it 's just something that the  m n  m i l f at that time was hoping would happen
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but uh we must still understand that our neighboring countries have their own problems
""
""
uh uhm that 's right
""
""
and we are not sure whether they are just about ready to extend an invitation
""
it 's just like you and i 're talking and suddenly we would we would like to uh uh thresh out our problems and we say let 's go to the house of karmina     when she has not extended us an invitation
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
yeah
""
""
and she may not even serve us breakfast
""
""
huh  chuckle 
""
okay secretary yes or no on this particular question
""
are you going to allow the talks between uh the g r p and the n d f this time to be held at another country
""
""
well again actually that 's something that uh we hope uh atty bello will be able to thresh out during his personal conversation
""
probably that thing would have happened already yesterday
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and uh i 'm sure when atty bello returns he will tell us what will be how the disposition of the n d f might be on this particular matter
""
""
okay and when are the two envoys expected to come home
""
""
well uh i was told that uh they 're supposed to be there only about three days
""
""
okay
""
