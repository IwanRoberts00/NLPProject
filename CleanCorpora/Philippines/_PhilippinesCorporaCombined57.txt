why should i start okay what was the last movie you 've seen oh come on laughter  are we going to talk about that laughter  no i don't think so i think it 's worth talking about it the last movie i 've seen  oo yeah uhm no i guess it 's uh sort of the question would be the last movie that i think was the best that i 've seen okay you were with me when we watched the green mile right  ye i i don't think so the green mile tom hanks we were with sir bruce and lavoxa okay i was with you and the guys   you were with us   yeah   uh uhm  it was well for me a very touching movie uh gotesco one so i liked very much how about you green mile was kinda cheesy cheesy since uh it was wrote by stephen king a horror a horror writer but i never not that i don't like it it 's just that it never appealed to me maybe the  uh uhm  and what appealed to you  maybe the   boys don't cry  yeah di ba i liked that movie i never liked that one about pretending to be a boy uh-huh and no one realizing that you 're really a girl uh uhm and then being murdered later on and raped it was gross uh i never liked that you were the one who asked me to watch that it was a nice movie hillary swank won an oscar for that but he was i mean she was raped   she she was raped it was a real life story it was a kind of a real laughter  are you 1 word at me whatever anyway she was raped from behind so what  laughter so what  how about m i m i two mission impossible two  m i two was great uh technically wise we were not together when we watched that one yeah but we were in the same cinema uh-huh i think you were with fr glen fr glen i was with rey and mike because you asked me not to watch it with you because you will you will be late uh-huh and and you told us that you would be late so we we moved on we watched the movie by ourselves not waiting for you because you would belate  e but but the thing is you never waited for me i always do i made tampo that like that uh at that moment uh  yeah   then   ang baduy mo  thank you because the thing is uhm the reason why you watched that movie earlier than i did was uhm perhaps because everyone would be late also so it would be perhaps   the reason why we met was because of the bingo by the jaycees which was not continued that day  yeah  yeah it was postponed for two weeks then   and you were not there during the bingo i was sick could you blame me you were not sick then i was sick since uh thursday you were not talking to me you were not talking to me uh uhm you were not talking to me because we were waiting for you that thursday night when at the north lounge we always do we waited for your last exam uh during that time but then you never showed up we left then we saw you well my mind was not actually clear at that part we saw you with who 's that christopher and bhang we were settling a case i guess oh that time uh oh and i was sick waiting for you   'cause we were 'cause we were not talking then why can you imagine we 're talking about this on tape now laughter  we 're talking about not talking anyway because monday uh we worked at j v in the morning then tuesday i was out you said j v right g v you said j v laughter  g v you said j v   j v f m chuckle   uy one day sonia went to the station and brought you bibingka   she was  no no it was not sonia uh the one who brought the bibingka was a couple and they sort of just brought the bibingka because they said they were listening to our show and sonia came there because she 's organizing this uhm club which you know we 'd like to call friendship club kiko and friends if if ever we would have to be to to uhm name that organization what do you think would be the best i can't think of anything right now it 's a public service program i was i was thinking that it should not be only focused on our show but on others as well because   as g v per se uh uhm the great goers  the best  uy one time i uhm after our class in la salle when a classmate approached me and told me that there 's this d j who said on air that i was not texting him anymore it 's like as if he 's asking to text him again and he said his his duty is during the night time so i guess it 's if i 'm not mistaken it 's dean dean dennis dennis you never went to maverick 's birthday because i was sick saturday you never returned the tape i haven't returned the tape i ha i still have the tape at home you 've got to return it to your friend of course i 'm gonna return the tape it 's not mine  laughter after revie  it 's even recorded for him not by him i see  ha dead air dead air laughter  i know  i haven't had lunch likewise chuckle   are you saying laughter   hungry   saying what uhm saying what what time would you be coming again to class two o'c two o'clock uh uhm for my theology class so you have built your name in theology yes everybody knows that i don't believe in god  wh why is that you know when we had rizal it was like sir pieto told us that there 's nothing wrong with believing it 's like when you believe now and you die later and then you realize there is no god then there 's nothing to regret about because you are already dead but if you die and you realize there 's really a god how could you regret you 're dead yeah that 's why so i so the point is there 's nothing wrong with believing i think uh believing is just having uh a hope that okay i 'm gonna die i 'll meet this person who who guided me all my life and doesn't it give you anything like a spark in your life  a hope   you could be a spark in my life speaker a chuckles  you could be my hope oh i see   see i don't have to fai to have faith on this someone i do not know 'cause i have faith on myself i have faith on my friends but the thing is don't you think it 's uhm sort of natural for somebody to hold something above him uhm like someone who would not put him down it 's like i know you can believe on me and count on me but then i also have these times when i go up and then i go down and well i it 's not that i want to put you down but there might be a time that i may be putting you down just like the time that we were not talking to each other so so the thing is isn't he sort of somebody who you 'd place above you and like he 'd not put you down uh that is making a false hope of yourself i mean if you put me down it 's just a a mere fact because you 're a human so not that you 're supposed to make mistakes it 's just that you can't avoid mistakes uh uhm granting that putting me down is a mistake uh no okay  does it give you some sort of hopeless attitude why nothing it 's just you 're hopeless not me  laughter this conversation really words  and what else uh you know back in u p i had this uh classmate uh uhm uh his uh point of view or argument is that god is only an excuse that if i ask you why does it rain  precisely   because you can't answer you would say god  uh-huh so that 's an excuse not that god created the rain  it 's just that you don't know the answer so you say it 's god  uh uhm  i guess that 's the precise point laughter  that i don't know i guess it 's for me it fits me that whenever i do not understand a thing especially i it 's not with regards to things that you could study about but it 's with things that you have to believe in without looking  i always say it 's because of him because my mind is that limited  uhm  how could you always say that uh it maybe it 's just meant to be that way but not really make an excuse i mean if there 's a god how would you feel that he 's just an excuse  yes  uh uhm i just hope that everybody else can understand you as much as the people close to you can understand you the thing is they have this tendency to put religion down one 's throat and uhm can you blame them we 're in la salle yeah that 's that 's the sad thing   a catholic school  that 's the sad thing about la salle they uhm entertain students from different uhm religion and then they enforce you to take up eight theology classes and make you believe in the god they in the first place you never believed in i think my teacher 's ano scared of me scared of you ha  he 's a new teacher  scared or challenged  scared scared scared like a virus something   he talks to me like are you fine speaker a laughs   uh-huh  yes i 'm fine everything is fine are you  laughter hello anybody here  hay naku  anyway let 's talk about our favorite author jessica zafra   zafra the bitch from hell there was this episode and i and i don't know if if you were able to watch it but points of view uh uhm their show is now on every mondays mondays same time i guess ten thirty there was this segment when she said that uhm uh i don't know what our guest said but i think he 's he 's been very much disoriented and he she said uhm it so sarcastical so sarcastic that uh the rest of the cast were just like freezing there waiting for her to say something nice which she didn't and i don't think we should expect jessica zafra to say something nice yeah word laughter  i don't know i remember one time when she said if you elect me as president the whole philippines will be in chaos why chuckle  and uh all the teachers in u p are practically dying of starvation  chuckle how come oh because in u p you have the i think a very low salary uh you teach because of teaching per se not because of the money uhm i guess it 's similar with most of the teachers nowadays they teach for passion not for the money uh uhm what do we do for passion eeecch  i have something in mind but i don't think i can say it chuckle  no no no what i mean is sometimes we tend to do things that are way beyond what other people expect of us and yet we do not wish to have something in return oh yeah that that job in g v if you could call it a job uh uhm a non-paying job how many months have we been working there since march and we have received but five hundred pesos five hundred not counting expenses   plus some expenses  yeah my mom is telling me 'wag ka nang pumunta diyan ano ba'ng napapala mo diyan  it 's it 's the other way around i keep telling my mother i do not want to go anymore and she 's the one who 's always asking me to go there i don't know why because she 's friend with ronel uh that figures the sped thing what 's that what sped stands for s p e d special education yeah and that 's where my sister goes too  uhm at any rate i guess i guess weng 's job is similarly  weng 's job  of going around the seventy-two barangays every saturday and wednesdays
