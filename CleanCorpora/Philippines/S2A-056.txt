""
during the last uh consecutive weeks we have uh studied the
chemical tests related to aldehydes ketones alcohols amines carboxylic acids
""
and i presume and i hope that you have made a comprehensive record
in your lab notebook about the observations that you uh uh nah you saw
 'no 
""
this afternoon uh we will put to our final test all the things that
you have learned
""
i will give you ten uh unknown liquids uhm and  by group one
group one sample
""
you have to be judicious in their use because it 's a limited amount
so uh use only the prescribed amount in your uh um tests last several weeks
""
you will have to identify what uh liquid it is and to give you
incentive the first person who can uh submit to me  o  who can
who can tell me the correct identification the first group i will award a
ten-point extra bonus  'no 
""
the second place uh will be given a seven-point bonus and the third
place a five-point bonus
""
haste make waste if you come to me with the identification and it is
wrong i will deduct three points
""
i will deduct that 's why you have to be careful
""
now uh this is this is where the value of your lab notebook comes
in
""
if you took if you did the experiment last time and you were
helter-skelter with the observation you will spend a lot of time uh
identifying these because your observations might be inconclusive
""
anyway all of the reagents uh relevant to the analysis are uh
lined-up at the back
""
  mero    =beginning of tagalog word for
there is/are  there are uh amine reagents carboxylic acid reagents
alcohol reagents and ketone reagents
""
so i think before you uh embark uh before you embark on the
chemical test you have to plan out your strategy  'no  how you
will go about it
""
perhaps secure four test tubes and then uh among the four sets of
reagents uh on hand you choose the surefire method of identifying a ketone a
surefire method of identifying an alcohol a surefire method of amines
 etcetera  so you would be able to identify once and for
all that  th  this is an amine group and then you have to focus on
that and then identify whether it 's a primary amine secondary amine tertiary
amine you know what i mean
""
okay
""
yes  question in tagalog from student, not very audible 
""
you go back  student asks question in tagalog, not very audible
  ha 
""
well  student asks question, not audible  uh you you have to
get  sel-con  self-consistent result
""
if one test is positive and then you come to me with the
identification i will look for confirmation confirmatory evidence  di
ba 
""
and uh when you have the confirmatory evidence then you are sure
and the chances are you won't be wrong  coughs 
""
imagine that uh imagine that you 're a practicing medical doctor
and you extracted a liquid from a patient 's uh stomach and this is it and
you want to know what the what 's the cause of the death  'no 
""
so you have to identify alright
""
uh i was thinking that the first place uh winner uh we will uh we
will put on the victory stand and we will sing the national anthem for him or
her but we are all filipinos we 'll be singing one national anthem right
""
 maliban  uh apart from the chinese in the group or
korean or japanese  mayroon bang  japanese  sa inyo
""
""
none
""
anyway so uh i need not elaborate on the tests because it can be
quite complicated
""
the records in your lab notebook of your observations should be
sufficient so uh i will now assign you the compound samples that we have 
students speak at same time, inaudible 
""
yeah
""
when your tests when you have when you have performed several
confirmatory tests  hali   beginning of tagalog word for the phrase
for example  for example you have a liquid you added diphenyl hydrazone
and it formed crystals on like in your observation then perhaps what you need
to do is repeat it
""
get another drop and then test it it gives
""
then uh what other what other test or ketones do you have so test
that also
""
so when those tests are jibing together then that means you have a
good uh a reasonable basis for your conclusion okay
""
one test does not constitute a conclusion okay
""
so  kumpleto  are we complete  counts students
 nine twelve fifteen we are only nineteen one person missing
""
 ha  johnson tan  student says something  he
might arrive he might arrive later
""
anyway i 'll distribute now your unknown sample uh group one
 teka muna  group one de leon okay so please okay i will give
you sample four
""
five okay number five to group one
""
group two group two i 'll give to the group the hardest one okay
number ten okay
""
they they 're all the same difficulty  'no 
""
group one number ten uh quiambao quiambao and feig okay
""
who 's your partner
""
uh the uh group seven group seven i 'll give number one ilagan okay
""
group uh  ay  wait a minute group seven one
""
group five leonor and who 's the partner of leonor  natanawan
""
eight okay  ano ano ang  group  mo 
""
number five number eight
""
alright uh number two will be given to group eight eight toledo and
sayas okay
""
do not do not use lots amount of it
""
two two will be yours okay
""
offhand i do not know what those chemicals are i do not know
""
i have no complete record i have no uh list from the stock
personnel yet
""
i just gave him instructions to make this for me
""
alright uh group six tan and kayla you 're yours is three
""
then number four i will give to group group ten group ten this is
co and quiambao uh no no co and panagsagan
""
alright alright
""
by the way if we should finish the identification today in next
meeting  check-out unless you want to work some more
""
i don't either okay
""
number number nine i 'll give you number six  baligtaran
 number nine who is your partner romero  arriola alright number
six
""
you have  student asks question, inaudible  beg your pardon
""
in your notebook create a  next experiment 
identification of an unknown
""
write in your notebook the unknown number and then you 'll proceed
with analysis
""
alright number seven will have to go to number four
""
who is yeah number seven uh that is chua and san pedro okay do you
have yet
""
okay so your group is jimenez three nine okay nine okay
""
okay so please
""
okay you can secure uh one of these uh medicine uh  dro 
droppers  'no 
""
i think this is for uh putting uh  ba  uh drops on babies
 'no  all the way to the stomach  'no 
""
uh one of these and use this only for your sample
""
make sure you do not cross-contaminate your sample with any liquids
that makes your reaction or experiment inconclusive  'no 
""
get one each and don't break the tip alright  question from
student, inaudible 
""
oh yeah
""
and also  d </. do not  m  make sure that you do not
touch the liquids on the inside of the rubber
""
it will contaminate your sample okay
""
get one each okay
""
uh  all systems are go alright
""
now if you uh if you care  you you have to do your work more
systematically uh  n  not just because that i gave you incentives to
uh get the first result means that you 'll have to be haphazard alright
""
good luck  
""
""
""
okay so for the in order to get the pulse rate okay so this is
the machine that we would be using so it 's called the  power lab
 okay  in-  advertise  pa  okay
""
power lab it comes with this software so it 's just linked to a it
also comes with a card
""
okay  alam nyo ba yung  card  sa 
computer  yung di ba may  sound card  ganyan 
video card
""
it it comes with this special card okay called the  scassi 
card okay
""
i don't have to elaborate what scassi means it 's just um a
technical jargon again
""
scassi card  ano nga ba yun o mamaya titingnan natin yon
nakalimutan ko 
""
okay so this is connected to you have cables here connected to a
scassi card  sa  computer okay
""
so that scassi card is responsible for okay actually processing
your signals okay
""
so to get the pulse rate so this is uh this is our sensor okay it 's
the sensor that we would be using
""
this is called a  finger pulse transducer  so
another word for  sensor  is  transducer
 okay
""
so later on you would place uh one finger the tip of your fingers
here okay the middle finger that you would use later on
""
okay so  ilalagay nyo siya sa  channel one 
pakikabit naman sa  channel one  o 
""
channel one this one
""
okay  na naka-  lock  na 
""
 parang  oscilloscope just like an oscilloscope
""
ayan
""
okay so once that is uh okay  nakakabit na yan  so
we  plu  you put this one  doon sa  middle the tip of
your middle finger okay
""
uh put it in this way in such a way that this is  nakalagay
dito  okay  hindi doon sa  opposite side actually
 puede rin sa  opposite side but this is  mu  much
convenient way to do
""
okay so once this is all set up uh what you do would be to click
this one chart for  windows  okay
""
on double click so  tingnan nyo yan dapat nag- 
orange  yan  okay
""
so that means that the machine and the computer is communicating
""
okay so you would uh have this one when you start it up you 'd
have this uh so  ang dami di ba  so you have a lot of uh
windows so we would just close this one 'cause we do not need this one okay
""
so what we would need so you open so open this is an open dialogue
box  hindi diyan  okay so  ilagay na punta lang kayo sa
 c program files  sa  a v i instruments this was the
company which built that machine
""
 experiment settings  okay so these are simply
like templates okay
""
 para hindi nyo na kayo mag-  adjust  ng mga
 windows  'no naka-adjust na yang mga  windows for
different experiments
""
like now we would this is an introductory so pulse rate so we
would do this uh next time e c g uh e m g okay e e g okay
""
so we would be doing that okay
""
so we open so we have this so  naka  set-up 
na yung  experiment okay
""
so before uh so you maximize this  para walang problema
 okay  ha  okay  lang yon  okay
""
so the first thing that you do so the first thing that so once
this is already set up so you choose this one  nakalagay 
channel one okay
""
so you choose inpunt  mispronunciation  input input
amplifier okay
""
so  makikita nyo diyan ano di ba  so the range is
ten volts so ten volts there negative ten volts at the bottom so what does
that mean
""
so  napaka  so  wala kang makita halos
 that means that the range is too too large okay
""
 e sabi natin yung mga  bioelectric signals they
are very very small okay
""
so we adjust this one  depende 'to sa tao ha may mga ibang
tao malakas yung  pulse rate  yung  amplitude
""
so let 's say  ilagay ko siya sa  two hundred
 masyado pa ring mababa ilagay ko sa  one hundred millivolts
 mababa pa rin 
""
okay so fifty let 's say  ayan  okay  a few
minutes of question and answer in tagalog with students 
""
so let 's uh click  o k 
""
so this means that this range actually this uh this process here
is just for you to know the correct range okay
""
so  yung  correct range which in this case is fifty
millivolts okay
""
so we click  o k 
""
 pakita ko sa inyo  how you store this data okay
""
so click  o k  okay
""
and then once you uh  na naka-  ready  na
 fifty millivolts so you can start recording  kanina hindi pa
nagre-  record you 're just actually like calibrating your um the
range okay
""
so  start  would mean  recording
 okay
""
so  iyon na yun  so let 's record for  ilan
kaya  uh let 's say ten seconds
""
ten seconds  o sobra na gawin nating  twenty five
seconds  o  twenty seconds  na lang 
""
okay so you already have your that 's only only temporary so
temporary  lang siyang naka-  store okay stored in the memory
of your computer okay
""
uhm so once you have have you have this now once you have that you
can actually save this uh save  natin ha   file
""
""
so  save as  so  ilagay natin gawa tayo
ng  folder for all of you
""
so uh  so you place the file name like for example pulse rate
okay
""
so you save it in this type of file a v i chart a v i c h t okay
""
uh if you save your file so  ito ise-  save 
nyo rin 'to ha  save your file in this format  pero syempre
 later on we would like to open this this uh the one that you
recorded also in excel in word also
""
let 's say uh you want to present that later on okay so later on
 pakita ko sa inyo  on how to save this uh recorded signal
 sa  excel  sa  word also okay  brief
exchange in tagalog with students 
""
okay so next step so we have this temporarily recorded uh
bioelectrical pulse rate so what 's the next step
""
you have to compute for the pulse period okay so you could either
move this uh cursor  nakita nyo iyong  x
""
so place it at the peak  nasaan yung  peak
""
 o ayan  then you get the time in seconds then you
move to the next peak which is this one  okay
""
so  kunyari yan medyo  sensitive  siya ayan
""
""
so that 's the time for the next peak so to get the so 
yung kailangan mo yung  period so you get the time interval
""
so the time that you got a while ago and this one so this one
minus this one that is your pulse period but there 's an easier way 
kasi medyo mahirap yan kasi tatantyahin mo pa di ba 
""
you could either so let 's just pick so  piliin natin itong
 portion  lang na 'to  okay
""
 sobra mali mali 
""
so  magtiyaga kayo sa  mouse
""
so let 's uh choose this uh  itong dalawang  peaks
 na 'to 
""
we can actually zoom into this peak  para mas madali
 okay
""
so let 's zoom so you choose this button so that button at the top
 itong nasa itaas ha  this one  nakalagay naman e
lalabas naman e 
""
zoom window and then if you want to find the time interval so
 lagyan natin ng  mark so drag  ito 
""
you place it at the this first peak  ang hirap ayan
nilagyan nyo ng  mark
""
then you place this one on the next peak the x  ang hirap
 okay  may sariling utak 'to   referring to the
mouse  .
""
so as you can see there  nasaan na yun nandoon e nagtatago
""
""
 delta  okay it 's right over here  ay
nawala 
""
okay so it 's the the one there  yung nandoon nakita nyo
 point zero
""
uh  teka dito na lang sa  remote  eto na
lang 
""
actually it 's  delta  t okay  delta
 t
""
so if you use this mark  yung  m you have uh you
would uh measure at once the time interval  delta  t
""
so  delta  t is point  ano yun saan na
yun  so point five seven five
""
and that is your pulse period okay so pulse period okay so from
there you get the pulse rate just take the reciprocal
""
okay so  ilagay nyo rin na  pulse  sa
 rate pulse per second and pulse per minute before exercise then
after this uh after getting your pulse rate uhm before exercise so 
mag-  bike  kayo  for  lahat kayo 
""
 tig-isa lang ito  so uh take turns okay
""
 ma-  experience  nyo rin lahat 
""
okay so while uh one group while one group is busy here the rest
of you i want you to think about your project that you would be doing okay
""
