yeah hello jimmy  how are you hello what are you doing i 'm fine i 'm just sitting here doing nothing uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh uhm i called up just to you know ask you something  i is that fine with you that 's okay with me uh okay because you see last time we saw each other where is that in uhm what 's the name of that coffee shop again uh starbucks no it 's not starbucks the other one uhm in ha in where is that figaro uh yeah figaro   yeah figaro and i i told myself i really wanna sit down with jimmy one day and just ask him anything under the sun you know okay i find you very interesting giggle  same here okay so uh-hmmmh what are you busy of these days nothing really except that i 'm working on my paper and my thesis oh yeah i heard so when will be your colloquium well supposedly this term i think next month that is in august oh good luck then huh yes good luck thank you very much i need that okay i know you can do that i 'm sure you 're very good and with sterling around i 'm sure you can do it okay anyway and of course after that one what 's your plan  uh-huh uh-huh  well i plan to conduct it already so that i would have the results by by december  and i 'll start writing hopefully submit the final paper by march of next year  uh-huh  oh that 's good  so you are very focused  thank you  oh as always you are very organized  thank you   systematic and focused so that means by next school year we will be classmates in the p h d i still don 't have any plans for p h d you mean not for now uh-hmmmh uhm what about words  uh i just i 'll see what will happen uh-hmmmh so you want to what spend perhaps your life with more exciting things uh nothing exciting for the moment  not no no no ideas for now  uh-hmmmh  uh okay so what would you like to ask me  chuckle i i saw one time all about your what 's that arts what 's that your drawings sketches sketches   yes oh yes so why why aren 't you doing sketches anymore this time to be quite honest with you my schedule is very busy uh-hmmmh and uh it requires a lot of uh focus time and hard work so it 's almost impossible to release it down to sketch  uh-hmmmh  i see plus the fact that i have a lot of papers to check and a lot of students to meet oh i understand yes usually what mood do you need so that you can start any sketch i i can 't exactly define the mood but it 's it 's just when it occurs it 's there and then you you sort of sit down but it 's it comes regularly when when when uh you you start doing it so it goes on and on for a month or so i see but if you talk about mood in terms of days and any time of the year it 's almost impossible i see i see but do you need let us say uhm do you need say a bottle of beer or a cup of coffee to keep you going or something like that  no  not necessarily oh not necessarily so what prompts you to let 's say get your paper and pencil and uh start sketching sometimes i see other people 's work and uh  uh-hmmmh something comes up in my head and uh sometimes i say oh i can do something like this or i can i think i can do something better than this or i think i have an idea brewing somewhere so that 's it   i see  what about love is it a good motivator you think love uhm it 's never worked for me oh oh why  uhm that 's something unusual uh i thought for artists it 's  sometimes  i cannot recall any instance in the past where love was really an inspiration for you know a force in my work but it 's very hard to really explain what what would be an inspiration it 's just that you have an itch inside you and you wanna do it you wanna sketch and that 's it it doesn 't have to come from anyone it doesn 't have to come from anywhere it just occurs  uh really  i see i see what about if you are depressed i 'm sorry if if you are depressed depressed   sometimes depression yes uh-hmmmh depression is is uh is a driving force it 's quite powerful in fact because you   even more powerful than love you find a way of expressing the you know the frustrations the depression the negative feeling and sometimes they come out in in work either in sketches so oh yeah if you could consider you could consider it uh a force as well to reckon with oh so have you sketched uh anything before in which you were depressed  uhm yes in fact when i was raped when you were raped laughter you were raped i want you to expound on that what do you mean uh physically emotionally when you are when you are violated oh that 's what you mean for the first time you cannot sleep you wake up at three in the morning staring at the ceiling wow i can imagine uh-huh and it 's hard to talk to people because people are not always  you think people are not always understanding and open to your you know experiences and you just keep to yourself and you don 't know where to run for help oh oh you sound very emotional  so  drawing and sketching can be a very good release uh-hmmmh some of the negative vibes vibrations that you get from very unpleasant experiences i understand uh-hmmmh you sound very emotional today speaker b laughs  jimmy huh well i 'm just a little bit serious today that 's all i have a back that 's killing me  laughter oh yeah i understand so when do you plan to i mean get another sheet of paper and start  uh   uhm maybe when i retire that 's about ten years from now oh don 't tell me you 'll go back to sketching only when you retire yes because i want to sit comfortably in a nice house uh-hmmmh in a garden perhaps where i don 't have to think about checking papers  laughter wow  talking to students who are begging me to change their grades  speaker a chuckles or i have to put up with with a p h d you know p h d courses none of those things uh so are you telling me that you don 't really consider taking p h d course  i 'm not saying   i mean in the years to come i 'm closing my doors to that it could be okay i can consider that as an option okay but it 's not like it 's not like it 's number one in my list uhm what about love life love life i haven 't had one in a long time you have any suggestions  chuckle oh speaker b chuckles  you want uh what a blunt answer to that well i 'm not too sure it 's good to discuss that on the phone maybe over a cup of coffee sometime  chuckle   yeah   true true  yeah i look forward to that i look forward to that okay that 's interesting you know uh-hmmmh uh what about you   talking about love life i i think it 's nice to have one yeah you were telling me you have not had that love life for quite sometime already what about well how can you have a love life if you sit on a desk   facing a lot of books a lot of people who talk about theories  uhm  but you can always insert that in your busy schedule dear yes but if you 're so busy you have no time to go to the  burol or the funeral or you have no time to go to the malls and you have no time to gimmick so how do you expect to meet people  uhm  so how do you but i 'm trying to think about that now lately it 's been it 's probably time for me to start you know  relaxing a bit uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh so finally  okay so what prompted you to at least have that idea again well i think i need some time for myself any 1 word  not could you suggest one oh i 'll tell you over a cup of coffee as i said a while ago yes i think that cup of coffee is is is well anticipated uh true true uh anyway uh so what will you do after this one after what after aft uh yeah our conversation  after  well i 'm going straight to the hospital and get my examination because my back has been killing me for three or four days i can hardly move and it 's painful  i see  yeah last saturday you also complained about that right exactly it 's been chronic uh which is why i went to see a doctor yesterday uh i hope that 's not because of old age chuckle  well it definitely has nothing to do with old age i think i see probably something else fatigue overwork perhaps i i can 't tell i don 't really know that 's already a sign that you have to give yourself a break yeah relax wind up go somewhere uh-hmmmh so uhm tomorrow uhm is thursday  o saturday what do you plan to do on saturday saturday i have work to do again work yes i have to teach a group of students uh so   so we have to make a little our ends meet i see  what students   well actually  we have to earn a little spending money uh what students from here from la salle   no they 're from they 're filipinos actually professionals oh i see   they want to gain some confidence in speaking english oh i see my job is just you know give them well practice opportunities to speak english and give them some strategies and teach them how to convey ideas in a very systematic way oh so these are all professionals yes that 's correct oh so you are making money during weekends   not really  actually just barely enough to make ends meet i see i see   i 'm not really after so much money pay my bills yes oh oh uh sundays   sun   sundays  i don 't know usually i just stay home but that ' s the perfect time to relax  i usually go to the malls you don 't go to the malls did you say that i do go to the malls and look for books  uh i see books yes books i like books uh-hmmmh uh what about movies do you do you ever do do you ever look for books yourself yeah i do i do but lately you know i 've been reading this children 's lit i enjoy it because of my son  i see   it 's all about harry potter   so does he read already pardon does he read already yeah yeah he he reads but for now i i read it for him  uh-hmmmh   okay because it 's all about harry potter but how young is your son four and a half going to five actually four and a half going to five  yeah   i see   go going to five okay so he loves actually stories like like that of harry potter so i need to know actually the whole story so i can tell him i can relate to him  you mean you read him harry potter yeah he likes it even without pictures without pictures he loves actually the names you know he would you know repeat the names when i say say i see hermione granger and then he would also say hermione granger actually just the names of the characters and the names of the places he you know he is fascinated with them i see oh that 's interesting to know yeah uhm i like my son to be uhm what uhm a book worm later  chuckle  okay oh what about sundays you mean you go to the malls
