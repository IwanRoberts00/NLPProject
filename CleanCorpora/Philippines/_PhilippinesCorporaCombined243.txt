thank you mr chief justice mr chief justice i 'll be very very brief i uh feel when i 'm standing in this chamber this evening that uh i 'm actually facing the bar of history and the bar of public opinion there is a certain amount of tre trepidation in my heart but nonetheless i must perform my duty as i must being a member of this chamber mr president uh mr uh chief justice i 'm not saying at this point that president joseph ejercito estrada is guilty of the charges against him neither am i saying that he is innocent not yet what i 'm saying at this point and this is the only issue before us is that i cannot as a judge perform the function of the house of representatives which has the sole power authority and perer  prerogative to prepare the articles that will impeach and impeach the president if indeed the president of the philippines committed the alleged wrongdoings being imputed to him on the basis of the facts claimed to have been uncovered by the prosecution after the articles of impeachment have been elevated to the senate then let the house of representatives perform its constitutional duty to prepare a new set of article or articles of impeachment to embody the newly discovered acts of alleged wrongdoing to do otherwise mr uh chief justice and ladies and gentlemen of the senate i humbly submit that this senate acting as an impeachment court has no power under the constitution to amend the articles of impeachment before us it cannot constitutionally and validly perform the task lodged solely by the constitution on the house of representatives to do that to do so would be a total travesty of due process and a transgression of elementary fairness you know mr uh chief justice ladies and gentlemen of this chamber we talk of discovering the truth there are people in this chamber who do not know the meaning of truth one time and i 'll tell you this i was charged with a crime that was not even in our statute books rebellion complex with murder and my witness to the fact that i was innocent and even the distinguished member of the senate senator cayetano knows about this and some gentlemen in this chamber know about this my witness was no less than a priest who was saying mass in my house at that very moment when they say that senator gringo honasan then colonel honasan was in my house with one hundred soldiers at that precise moment for which i was framed and jailed with rebellion complex with murder in order to immobilize me and you know what happened to father danilo dagsan the priest he was shipped out of this country by no less than jaime cardinal sin with the connivance and conspiracy of president corazon aquino and this is the opportune time mr president mr chief justice for me to put this in the annals and record of this republic so that future historians will know the entire truth about this thank you  uh thank you mr chief justice the whole country or maybe perhaps even filipinos in other countries are listening to us right now and i wonder how many of them think listening to our colleagues that they are listening to a political rally or they are listening to a legal proceeding because the nature mr chief justice and my dear colleagues of what has been going on in this chamber for the last month and a half has really been a an event uh which has in effect been an arena on two sides on the one hand you have the political arena and amado doronila correctly observed in a recent column of the philippine daily inquirer that those who are opposed to the continued tenure of president joseph ejercito estrada are winning the public opinion battle a very shall we say candid remark because he in effect is saying that what is going on is not really a trial for the impeachment of the president of the philippines but rather an effort to bring down that president not by the constitutional processes that we are actively engaged in but through the bar of public opinion and that perhaps mr president explains why many times in this court there are statements by the prosecution that uh it is making a pro offer it is announcing something that it will do to subpoena the records of citibank because the president his wife the ladies that he is so said to be uh associated with as well as his so-called cronies have accounts in the citibank and immediately the next day almost all the newspapers are headlining president estrada mrs eje loi ejercito estrada  etcetera etcetera have accounts in citibank as if this was gospel truth this is of course the arena of public opinion that is being fed by unsubstantiated loose remarks coming from the prosecution within this chamber we are therefore being used mr president we are being used we are being made puppets in a show to bring about the completion the success of an agenda that is not provided for in the constitution and that is what really is the unfortunate thing of what is going on mr president now mr president in this whole effort members of the senate are attacked by the prosecution there is a scoreboard there right across our very parking lot which ridicules us and of course those who are perceived to be not following the dictates of the mob and mr president we ourselves have turned upon each other and even in the lounge where we have our meriendas you will not you need not be perceptive to see how the groupings of the senators sitting with each other no longer show the old environment of cordiality that was present here  nagkakampo-kampo na tayo dun sa dining room those are the those are the the uh shall we say the heavy burden that we have to bear as the result of what is going on and uh i bewail this because it is unnecessary and it would have been totally different if there had been no  1 word t v cameras in this hall it would have been totally different and this is the result of all these cameras all over cameras peeking on our feet cameras trying to catch us asleep cameras trying to catch us talking to each other as if we were supposed to sit here like stupefied mummies listening to everything that is going on and so mr president tonight we are here voting on a very simple question i mean this is a question that a judge in the lower in the regional trial court rules on every day this is a question that justices of the court of appeals rule on the rules are very simple the rules are very clear the facts are very clear but because there is t v around this has become a big spectacle mr president i would like to say that our vote tonight even if some of us feel that they are casting their vote on the final judgment is not really a vote on a final judgment and the final judgment may or may not follow the result of the voting tonight and if there are those i think it would be appropriate to say who want to make a big issue out of this for their own purposes so be it for me mr president mr chief justice this is just a simple vote on a simple procedural issue that is well lie uh which is well-defined provided for in the rules of evidence and all the rules that we have been following so in conclusion may i say mr president and mr chief justice what is this fuss all about thank you  mr chief justice my colleagues it is quite unfortunate that my good friend senator juan ponce enrile brought up the issue again an incident of history that happened ten years ago i will not deal at length on that point i would rather just let history and our people decide on the action of the players at that time but let me just state that in nineteen ninety i was placed in a situation where i had to defend the existence of a duly-constituted government and therefore i invoked the law and the legal processes in order to protect the duly constituted government i did not take extra-legal measures i invoked a decision or the dissenting opinion in a case decided by the supreme court we followed the law we followed the constitution let the people judge our action in history but having said that mr president mr chief justice let m  uh let me now share my position insofar as this matter at issue uh at hand uh in issue at hand the issue here is whether or not envelope or the contents of envelope number two is covered or covered by the articles of impeachment it is argued that these are not covered by the articles of impeachment and therefore it is immaterial and irrelevant as argued by the prosecution should have been defense as they have done in the past in fact mr chief justice the phrase irrelevant and immaterial would be the most popular phrase these days  pumunta po kayo kahit saang party ang unang sasabihin sa inyo objection your honor on ground that it is irrelevant and immaterial   buong bansa po ay halos abogado na ngunit dito po ngayon ang tanungin natin ito ba'y talaga  irrelevant and immaterial  sa akin po kagalang-galang na chief justice  hindi po ang kagalang-galang na chief justice ay sinabi niya doon sa kanyang extended opinion dated december eighteen  in ordering the opening of the first sealed envelope that the objection based on immateriality would be premature and once the document obtained in connection therewith are formally offered in evidence that is the time when objections on materiality can be should be ruled upon  and therefore this issue has been ruled upon by the chief justice  kaya nga po kangina hinihingi ko kung pupwede ang  chief justice muna ang siyang mag-husga dito po sa ating pinag-uusapan dahil ito po irrelevant and immaterial ay isang patakaran sa husgado at sino po ang mag-huhusga sino po ang most qualified to judge on relevance and materiality it is the chief justice  kaya po aking hiniling kangina kung sana ang chief justice under the rule six of our rules would first decide on this unfortunately that was not possible because of the motion already been filed has this been ruled upon by the chief justice yes because on january ten two thousand by tu by january ten two thousand one by order of the chief justice this document was subpoenaed on june jan january ten two thousand one this su  this chief justice chief justice davide ordered through a subpoena  duces tecum ad testificandum that documents related to savings account number or savings account number zero one six zero six two five o one dash five be produced  bakit po ayaw ng defense panel buksan ang pangalawang envelope  maliwanag po dahil ito po ay pag-aari ni presidente joseph ejercito estrada doon po sa exhibit triple x na siyang isang sulat na ang sabi ni ocampo pinirmahan ni pangulong estrada bilang jose velarde ang nakalagay doon my savings account zero one six zero six two five zero one dash five   yan po ang sinabi ni jose velarde yan po ang sinabi ni pangulong aquino ni pangulong estrada maliwanag po na itong account na ito ay pag-aari ni pangulong estrada inamin po niya yan kaya po ayaw buksan ng depensa yan  grounds of relevance and materiality mr chief justice my colleagues envelope number two is relevant and material in our quest for truth envelope number two is relevant and material for the credibility of this proceeding  e envelope number two is relevant and material for the credibility of this institution envelope number two is relevant and material to the faith of our people in this democracy thank you mr president
