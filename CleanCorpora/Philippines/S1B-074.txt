okay okay melanie  please sit over here and let me take that
seat over there
""
so what we 're going to do today is to fit your new contact lenses
""
i 'll also be teaching you the proper way to handle to handle your
new lenses
""
""
doc would it hurt i mean the lenses would it hurt
  well maybe a little at first but you 'll get used to it after
awhile
""
i guess what you should expect when i first insert the contact lens
is that you would feel like as if a dust particle has entered your eye
 para ka lang napuwing 
""
you would feel tears in your eyes and may be a little dazzled by
light
""
""
it sounds worst than what i 'm going through with the glasses
right now
""
""
actually what you would experience is the normal reaction of
our eyes
""
it 's our sort of protective mechanism but it would only be
temporary  there 's nothing to worry about
""
""
okay
""
""
now the first thing you should do is learn how to insert and
remove your contact lenses
""
since i prescribed you with uh daily wear contact lens  you
should remove it clean it every night 
""
let me show you how to insert your contact lens
""
okay first thing is uh you should check if your lens is on the
right side  this is the way to do it  hold it between your thumb and
index finger and hold it like this
""
if the edges turns away from each other then your lenses are on the
wrong side  but if it turns over like this it 's on the right side
""
did you see the difference
""
""
yes
""
""
good
""
now if you happen to get the contact lens into your eye while it is
in on the wrong side don't panic
""
it would feel uncomfortable so all you have to do is remove it turn
it to the right side and reinsert it
""
""
okay
""
""
so let me insert the contact lens first okay
""
now let 's try it with the right eye 
""
now what i want you to do is to relax  look straight ahead 
that 's it  look a little bit upward okay
""
now don't blink  there
""
how does it feel
""
""
a little weird but everything 's clear when i cover my left
eye
""
""
melanie if upon insertion of the contact lens you would feel
that your vision is quite blurred what you should do is close your eyes and
rub your eyelids lightly  like this okay
""
""
okay
""
""
now if vision is still blurred and you feel uncomfortable
remove the contact lens because most likely there 's something or some sort
of particle inside your eye
""
so what you should do is clean your contact lens again before
re-insertion  you understand
""
""
yes
""
""
so do you have any question so far regarding the insertion of
your contact lens
""
""
none
""
""
okay 
""
now i 'll be teaching you how to remove your contact lens then
later you 'll have to be uh practicing removal and insertion of your contact
lens alone  okay
""
""
okay
""
""
so what you 're going to do right now is uh again look
straight ahead 
""
now don't blink 
""
there we already removed it 
""
how does it feel
""
""
fine
""
""
actually melanie   'no  uh having your
optometrist remove remove your contact lens is very easy  pero
 the problem lies in the fact that you have to do it by yourself
 di ba 
""
 kasi siyempre alangan naman  i 'll always be there
to remove and insert  laughs  your contact lens  so you 'll have to
learn to do it yourself
""
so what you have to do is when removing your contact lens for the
right eye you have to use your left hand  okay
""
hold your upper eyelid like this  and using your  fing 
uh middle finger for the right hand hold your lower eyelid like this
""
now what you should do is use your thumb and index finger of the
right hand and pull out the contact lens that 's it
""
do you think you can do it
""
""
i think so
""
""
okay
""
just relax melanie
""
""
is this the way to do it
""
""
yes just go on 
""
""
i can't seem to get it in
""
""
just relax and try it again 
""
now slowly  okay  slowly there
""
""
 ayan  i got it in
""
""
now does it hurt
""
""
not really
""
""
okay  so is your vision clear
""
""
yes
""
""
it doesn't feel uncomfortable or anything
""
""
well a little but tolerable
""
""
good  so basically that 's it
""
so now you might as well try removing it
""
okay concentrate  slowly  now pull it up
""
""
there
""
""
good  now a little more practice and you you 'll be like a
pro
""
i want you to try wearing your contact lens for the for at least
two hours and then increase your wearing schedule by four hours every day
until your eyes can totally accept the contact lens
""
now be sure to clean your contact lenses every day and everything
will be okay
""
now if you should have any problem regarding your contact lens you
might as well drop by the clinic or you can maybe call me up  okay
