""
""
my team nowadays well i go with uh the blazers yeah the portland trailblazers
""
""
portland trailblazers
""
""
yeah
""
""
  because of who 
""
""
  word  you know   pippen from the bulls who went to houston now he 's in portland trailblazers
""
""
uh
""
""
since he 's gonna join with the rookie of the year of nineteen ninety-six
""
""
who 's that
""
""
stoudamire
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
yeah and it 's an all-star cast rashered wallace uhm sabonis
""
""
do you think sabonis is good
""
""
that is one uhm seven footer
""
""
he 's good i think he 's so slow for a basketball player
""
""
 ay  he does well he 's okay
""
""
does he make a lot of shots
""
""
no but he does a lot of you know blocking and he can run faster
""
""
oh   for a center for his size 
""
""
 yeah for a big guy  
""
for a guy like him yeah and he can even dunk  word  and maneuvering within the paint
""
""
oh how old how old is he sabonis how old is he
""
""
i think he 's about he was a rookie with he was already in his thirties
""
""
and what year was that
""
""
uh that was way back in nineteen ninety-five ninety-six
""
""
nineteen ninety-five
""
""
yeah ninety-five ninety-six
""
""
so i guess he 's still young   as a center 
""
""
 yeah he 's still young  
""
""
uh
""
""
and and you know a lot of rookies nowadays just popped out from high school kobe bryant
""
""
uh
""
""
like kevin garnett
""
""
okay
""
""
they just popped out of high school no more college
""
""
do you think that portland  that portland has a chance of winning the championship
""
""
uh definitely
""
""
why
""
""
this season yeah
""
""
why
""
what makes you think so
""
""
there 's no more jordan and the spurs are not that that powerful
""
""
but the lakers have the best record
""
so what do you say about that
""
""
uh well there 's phil jackson and but i don't think
""
it 's a it 's phil jackson with a new team so  he it 's still like a dry-run for him okay
""
""
uh uh  ay  you know i heard the news about rodman coming back to the n b a
""
have you heard of that
""
""
yeah i 've heard that he 's not gonna have any more fancy hairstyle no more tattoos no more earrings and all that
""
he wants to be a good boy now not a bad boy
""
""
do you mean to say that she he had his tattoos removed 
""
""
 cough  his tattoos removed well
""
""
he had it erased
""
""
i heard it from one one of my friends that he 's going to be taking all those bad boy stuffs off
""
""
why what 's what
""
""
because he wants to be a good boy now
""
""
what triggered the change in his heart or change in mind
""
""
perhaps his being in jail and all that
""
""
oh who 's this does he have a wife now
""
""
yeah is that a right choice
""
""
i think they 're already divorced
""
""

""
tim duncan i think i couldn't find one
""
""
oh you 're not yet sure
""
""
yeah i guess it was  word  
""
""
well
""
""
uh you know in in card collecting you you know it 's gone down with the popularity
""
it 's gone down i don't think because of magic or because i think it 's because of you know the resignation of jordan
""
""
that 's the reason why
""
""
i think that 's primarily the reason
""
""
probably probably it 's because of pokemon 
""
""
  uh  urhhh
""
""
 uh  
""
what do you think of pokemon
""
""
pokemon  yeah i think it was the best you know animation for this year because it does not you know show  it 's it 's  unli  you know it 's  well all of them live no one dies
""
""
in pokemon
""
""
in pokemon no one dies i mean no no one you know cuts off his arm no bloodshed
""
""
uh yeah yeah
""
""
it 's it 's like uh a very very mild portrayal of violence
""
""
yeah some something good about pokemon is that it doesn't portray portray too much of violence and  gore
""
""
if you ask me it 's for for girls you know
""
""
oh no it 's not for girls
""
""
yeah
""
""
i 'm fond i 'm fond of watching pokemon
""
i even collect pokemons
""
""
 pika  oh sorry no offense  laughter 
""
""
it 's alright that 's it that will be fine
""
""
pikachu even got two you know those red thingamajigs you know on his cheeks you know
""
what are those  speaker a laughs  what are those
""
""
uhm that that is his weapon actually
""
""
  really 
""
""
 yeah   uhm it shoots electricity
""
""
and who is this raichu   laughter 
""
who is this raichu
""
""
raichu
""
""
yeah
""
""
oh he he raichu is the uhm
""
""
he looks like   pikachu but 
""
""
 yeah   he looks like pikachu
""
he is the evolved yeah raichu is the evolved version of the of pikachu
""
""
but  being evolved there are two distinct uh  pokemons right
""
""
yeah
""
""
like i saw pikachu and raichu fighting
""
""
yeah but then like because there are many pikachus actually
""
""
uh
""
 ha 
""
""
yeah there are many pikachus
""
if you have if you saw the cartoon last night uhm there were many pikachus okay
""
so one tends to evolve to a raichu or one can just choose to remain as a pikachu
""
that 's it
""
how about
""
""
uh primetime man i speak of voltes five and daimos
""
""
voltes five
""
now who 's the better robot  voltes five or daimos
""
""
wait uh  i can't you know tell
""
""
something like
""
""
i like i like daimos because of his  what 's that
""
""
blizzard
""
""
uh or his death blow  and his blizzard yeah he had this snow blizzard
""
""
snow blizzard
""
""
yeah at the end he had all these sorts of you know weapons snow blizzard and then the what 's this uh fire blizzard
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
yeah 
""
""
what do you think
""
okay something like  what if daimos and voltes five are going to fight
""
""
uh they can't fight because they 're both good robots
""
""
no something like  uhm they used the ones you usually read in marvel comics you see the incredible hulk fighting the spiderman 
""
""
that 's no problem because that 's marvel
""
""
so about
""
""
though i think what you were trying to say is d c against marvel
""
they 're two separate companies
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
with two different heroes fighting each other
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
yeah so with daimos and voltes five
""
""
who do you think is going to win 
""
""
oh boy well voltes five is a five-man team  laughter  five-man  ro  robot and daimos is only one but i think it 's evenly matched
""
""
evenly matched  with the weapons who do you think has
""
""
has more weapons
""
""
yeah
""
""
i think it 's daimos
""
""
daimos
""
""
has a lot more weapons
""
""
than voltes five
""
""
yeah the problem with voltes five is you know there is five heads working altogether
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
daimos has only one head
""
""
why
""
""
so i guess he 's more focused
""
""
what made it a problem for voltes five having these five going around
""
""
uh one head  chews the other   laughter 
""
""
now let 's go back to basketball
""
""
uh
""
""
about the p b a
""
""
p b a
""
""
what 's your favorite team 
""
""
a long time ago it used to be san miguel beer
""
that 's the time when i really liked watching p b a
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
with brown uhm  who was that samboy lim with teng with caidic
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
yeah they were the dream team for the philippines
""
""
how about the present san miguel team
""
how do you assess them
""
""
i think they won the the last conference
""
""
yeah
""
""
  or no 
""
""
 actually   the last two conferences they won it
""
""
yeah
""
""
yeah
""
""
two
""
""
yeah uhm
""
""
uh by the way do you know who the players are already in san miguel
""
""
line-up
""
""
yeah line-up
""
""
well uhm  i guess uh
""
hey somebody is writing something on the board
""
""
yeah i don't know what he 's writing
""
""
anyway  oh the guy already left anyway  laughter 
""
oh let 's uhm how about  chicago bulls
""
what do you think
""
do you feel sorry about the chicago bulls for    word  
""
""
 yeah   i mean it started out with a dream you know when when chicago their dream was to get three-peat the three-peat
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
yeah so once that dream was you know was came came to when they achieved that dream and then the uh i think the manager decided on having a new team uh no uh a team with new players to have a new target or     goal
""
""
 i guess  
""
i guess the team had already reached the point when uh something like we 're already at the top   of the world 
""
""
 yeah   there is nothing more to   to gain   words 
""
""
 after  
""
something like we are we are the best in the world
""
there 's no other way but to go down
""
we 've already reached the top
""
probably they came to that point already and now they 're languishing at the bottom
""
""
yeah well they 're already going down
""
they 're already at the bottom really  laughter 
""
in terms of  statisti  statistical you know outcome in the they 're really at the bottom   chicago bulls 
""
""
 chicago bulls  
""
""
and they just have two wins four wins out of how many games
""
""
i guess i guess they already have five wins just imagine five wins
""
""
out of thirty forty forty games something like that
 you know i think some of the core some of the line-up of last year was were still retained like kukoch
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
like brown
""
""
ray brown
""
""
randy  b 
""
""
i guess it 's randy brown
""
