 para sa akin and yet on the other hand we have to admit we do have a surfeit of people doing charity work uh uhm i don't know there are agencies of the government that make seven copies of the  corp corporate of a correspondence when they need only one to send and the second to keep ano   mga things like that uh uhm i think really uh that we have instead of cutting down on the number of the bureaucracy we have to try to retrain some of them and put them into the social services the teachers the rural workers stuff like that  'no   'yan  and you say congress is the place to do it well i think it 's where we initiate actions 'no uh and and congress to my mind has has done a lot of things for instance in the last uh session 'no people people tend to denigrate congress but in fact uh some substantial things have happened for instance the standardization of uh of uh positions in the in the in the government that was to me a very big word   civil service  yes in the standardization of positions everybody now whether you are a justice or a or a janitor or a driver you know you belong to some salary grade and you 're the same that cuts across the entire bureaucracy that was a very big step forward i think congress still has the ability to make changes like that  music  okay we 'll be right back  words the lone district of para&ntilde;aque and he 's running under the n u c d and uh he is the recently resigned chairman of the public estates authority you 're in some kind of a controversy over the proclamation of uh manila bay converting it into a satellite city of some sort yes yes uh when you when you plan ahead and you have big projects  you think of ten years from now it 's always controversial but it 's exciting  you 're five years ahead  now since you arrived late can we just ask you one question before we go to the non-runners here why are you seeking public office after your job at the p e a is there is this a power trip of some kind to you you can't let go of power you can't stop pushing people and pushing buttons no ahm in the public estates authority i 've learned a lot and i think i 've done projects that are good for not only para&ntilde;aque but uh pasay city and as far as las pi&ntilde;as but since i 'm a resident at para&ntilde;aque i 'd really like to continue the work that we 've started in the public estates authority such as and uh oh many many projects we started the coastal road it 's now expanded to six lanes we 've lighted it up uh the coastal road used to be a salvaging zone now peace and order prevails there because we 've set up a police precinct the southern police district is now also located in the coastal road we 're building two hospitals there one a ten story hospital another one a twenty-four hour emergency clinic government hospital no this is a joint venture between the government and the private sector uh uhm we 're also building the uh one of the biggest uh low cost housing areas in the government in cooperation with uh then g s i s general manager sonny belmonte  so you 're afraid you 're to let go of these beautiful projects you know [ 2> as a private citizen  but as a congressman you think you can supervise uh these projects in the future  words pangarap     that 's one that 's one  you know uh one thing you learn in government is that uh there are many things that you 'd like to do but you can't do and there are many things that have to be done to uh to make government become more efficient and one of the things that you have to do is perhaps improve some of the laws that restrict government from becoming more efficient  uhm  so when you become a congressman you will liberalize and deregulate that 's one of the things i 'd really like to do you see in government uh if you 're too slow they say uh you 're too slow why are you too slow if you 're too fast they say uh what 's wrong with you how come you 're too fast  so it 's got to be rationalized i mean you know we have to assume that government people are working in government because they want to do a good job the idea is to make it easier for them to do a good job rather than to make it difficult uh to do a good job and i think a few uh legislative pieces of legis uh legislation words   there 's something  okay so now we 've heard practically all the reasons for running now let 's go to the laughter to the customs commissioner and the uh airport general manager you know i think you two are just as good healthy energetic innovative etcetera as uh these gentlemen who are running uh but why aren't you don't you want to serve the people quote quote uh commissioner apacible well in my case jullie in nineteen eighty-four i was a uh very reluctant uh uh candidate for congress already so nakadanas na rin ako ng kampanya sa batangas buong probinsiya pa e  at that time i was still a bachelor so i had nothing to worry about but uh when the next elections came i was about to run i was already serving the development bank of the philippines uh i told myself you know i just uh have served government and doing something for our people in d b p  hindi naman pala kailangang mahalal para tumulong sa tao uhm  kaya noong eighty-seven nagpaplano na rin akong mag-asawa sabi ko pagka kung papasok ako sa pulitika baka magulo lang ang buhay ko kaya inuna ko muna 'yong aking pamilya sapagkat medyo huli na akong nag-asawa at uh dalawa lang kaming lalaki sa pamilya eh  uh uhm  kaya since nauna siya sa pulitika e di siya na muna kasi alam mo palabas ang pera diyan sa pulitika eh  uh uhm  kailangan naman ng isa para mag-alaga sa mga kapatid dahil lima ang mga kapatid kong babae  uh-huh  kaya patay na ang ama namin kaya sabi ko ako na lang siguro ang mag-aalaga sa pamilya ng naiwan kong ama at saka pamilya ko naman habang siya naman ay naroon pag sawa na siya siguro puwedeng pag-isipan ko na  uh what do you intend to do once you become a private citizen  wo won't you miss the power you know now you can uh order people to do this to do that things happen uh with a snap of the fingers yeah actually kasi jullie ang  orientation natin nagsimula tayo sa opposition  na 'yon  there was a time from nineteen seventy-eight to nineteen eighty-four i quit my business and my job because i really went full time uh in organizing the opposition against the past regime uh uhm  so nakita ko nang kaya kong mabuhay sa sarili kong ano maski na underground economy o maski buy and sell uh uhm so wala na akong takot diyan kaya lang nakita ko rin itong kapangyarihan once you 're in office pala hindi mo naiisip ito dahil sa dami ng trabahong ginagawa mo it 's only when you reflect maybe after i get out of my office that i will say to myself uy ang lakas pala ng aking uh puwesto ang lakas ang dami ko palang kapangyarihan di ko nagamit   pero on the other hand baka maipagmalaki ko 'to sapagkat no one in the family has even benefitted from that power that i am enjoying right now what about you general manager carrascoso why aren't you running you look like uh you can tackle the work of doc carrascoso basically jullie my role in government is uh first of all coterminous with the uh president aquino uh uhm and i gave myself four years to serve the government as if i was drafted in the army that 's about it i think uh you 've had enough of us or we 've had enough of you laughter  well i think uh we should we should uh lead a quieter life and probably go back to the private sector and words   what is your biggest frustration  well i think it 's it 's uh trying to please everybody uh-huh and i think uh uh you can't do it and it 's a thankless job and basically i think uh i have done my part and uh if somebody if they don't agree with some of my of my policies well i try to my best to serve uh uhm i 've always said that anyone who can straighten out the international airport deserves to be president i don't know if you gentlemen agree but you know that airport is really the heart of chaos anarchy lack of order lack of discipline lack of planning you know i 'm talking about the architectural uh requirements that are not there we 're talking about water not being there we 're talking about doors falling apart and people running in and out who should not be there uh by the way jullie i 'm the only agency with water and and power all this this time yeah   all the time ha you 're sure well how did you how did you do that well i planned it since last year that i knew that there would be a lot of problems as far as water and uh power is concerned and we addressed this problem as early as last year how did you ensure uh continuous power when the rest of metro manila suffers three to four hour brownouts every day well first of all they gave me a priority as far as this is concerned but uh there are ta times that we have real emergency powers over there and uh all of our air-conditionings are now decentralized uh uhm and so i think basically these are the uh the things that we have done over the years uh uhm and when i leave in june i 'll be leaving the the coffers of naia with one billion pesos oh that 's good now in the meantime what can you say about doc uh your brother seeking an elected office  di did your family have a meeting a council of some kind well to counsel him i found out that docky was running when i was on my way back in manila and i said well it it 's up to him if he thinks that he can serve the country on a bet on a different way and i think i wish him luck and hopefully he will win uh-huh did uh doc didn't you try to get ed to run also for some kind of an elected office uh what is that jullie didn't you try to get him to run oh no no no no  to convince him to run   uh we do not try to look into each other 's lives 'no laughter  our late father has taught us that way 'no  to leave each other in peace and maybe we just get together when we one is one has a problem or one needs help that is the only time that we get together but basically you 'll be surprised probably we don't see each other for about three four months  to each his own  uh uhm is this politics in the blood for for some of you for the apacibles this is your first time this is my first time the only other politician in the family was my great grandfather agapito zialcita whom you you never saw who was an original signatory to the declaration of philippine independence in eighteen ninety-eight and it stopped there uh-huh the rest of the family are professionals doctors engineers and uh i 'm the only one who 's trying this new thing in our case uh our late father was a congressman four-termer he died in office uh-huh so when he died uh alam mo ganyan ang kaugalian e kung mapasimulan ng ama pag mamatay gusto 'yong either asawa o anak e wala pa naman ako sa edad 'yong kapatid ko lang ang nasa edad kaya siya ang lumaban ng mayor sa aming bayan  and i think he was a uh two termer there or something like that three three three terms yeah he was one of the most outstanding uh mayors at that time but but so nakasimula siya siya na ang nauna kaya ako medyo nag- shift na ng career e  but to be frank ano isn't it nice to be just a plain simple private citizen i mean is the power that you get worth the trouble you know being unable to sleep soundly people knocking on your door at five o' clock in the morning people asking you for a job for money to bury the dead sonny you were a newspaperman tell me which part of your life did you enjoy most being a newspaperman or being the boss of the g s i s manila hotel philippine airlines you inherited all those positions i mean you got all those positions you know overnight and how did you how would you compare your happiness then and now and now you 're going into it you know again
