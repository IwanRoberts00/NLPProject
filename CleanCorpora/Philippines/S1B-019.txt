we continue with the lecture  on herbert marcuse and we told you that there were three influences on him namely hegel  'no  freud and marx
""
last time we uhm explained to you the influence of hegel on uh marcuse and we told you among other things that for hegel everything is in absolute unrest and so therefore nothing is static
""
nothing is congealed but everything will continue to flow
""
today we 're going to take up the influence of freud and if possible also of marx on marcuse
""
this is found in the book of marcuse entitled   eros  and civilization 
""
  eros  and civilization 
""
what in a gist is the influence of freud on marcuse
""
first of all according to marcuse this is marcuse 's interpretation of freud
""
that according to freud there are always two forces in human nature that are at loggerheads one with another
""
the positive is called the  eros  and the negative is called  thanatos 
""
you all know what  eros  means in greek
""
 eros  and  thanatos   writes on the board 
""
 eros  means love in greek
""
 thanatos  means death
""
but here in this particular idea  freud is trying to tell us that in every human undertaking there are two forces that are continually battling one with another
""
one is  eros  and he calls  eros  the builder of culture
""
the builder of culture  writes on the board 
""
and  thanatos  is supposed to be the destroyer
""
however he says the stronger the  eros  in other words when  eros  is on an upbeat  thanatos  is on a downbeat
""
if  eros  is down then  thanatos  is up
""
what does it mean
""
let us take for instance the building of culture
""
it 's something interesting because you know you never i 'm sure uh looked upon it in this manner
""
look at the way marcuse explains it
""
he says culture and civilization require a sublimation a desexualization for culture obtains a great part of the mental energy it needs by subtracting from sexuality
""
what does that mean
""
it means that if i want to be a great writer if i want to be a great artist if i want to be a great researcher and scholar i cannot be at the same time  be oversexed
""
meaning to say  sexuality is energy right
""
the building of culture requires energy
""
if i already spend a lot of my energy on scholarliness on art on culture and all that what happens
""
i have already removed part of my erotic energy and what would happen later on
""
there is nothing left
""
if this is down that will go up
""
meaning to say i 'll become destructive
""
i will become cruel
""
why
""
because i don't have any sexual expression
""
i uh do my work all the time all day and all night
""
i have no time for play
""
and what happens
""
that energy which is repressed will express itself in cruelty in violence
""
you might ask what is marcuse trying to say
""
simple
""
he says how can you explain that the countries that are most cultured are the most destructive
""
how can you explain germany supposed to be one of the most cultured in the world was capable of exterminating six million jews
""
how do you explain that
""
here is a country full of culture produced the three b 's bach brahms and beethoven produced schiller goethe
""
how come that it is capable of exterminating six million jews
""
and the explanation of marcuse is because the erotic energy was so repressed so suppressed and that energy had to go and be expressed sublimated in another way
""
and that is why he says look at the most cultured countries in the world they are the most cruel and violent
""
meaning to say do not look to the you know the little uh individuals like uh pol pot like idi amin
""
these are little you know little uhm butchers
""
what did pol pot really do
""
maybe he exterminated let us say one hundred skulls one thousand skulls ten thousand skulls
""
have you ever seen a picture wherein we have here a an entire wardrobe all containing skulls
""
and we are alarmed we say what cruelty
""
oh my goodness what are ten thousand skulls against six million
""
in other words the small minds of pol pot and idi amin were not enough to be able to  to prove enough cruelty to be  genocidia 
""
why
""
because it did not really have what it took
""
but he says look at germany the one that has really produced the great musicians the great philosophers remember you count hegel fichte  schelling   etcetera 
""
they were the ones who had produced the most cruelty
""
what is the reason
""
because of this energy of  eros  that was so suppressed
""
they built culture
""
they had no time for play
""
they had no time for sexuality
""
and so what happens
""
that sexuality that was suppressed that energy for sexuality that was suppressed will come out in  thanatos 
""
alright you know let me give you an instance
""
you might say does that mean that uh i should therefore give way to my sexual energies so that i will not be cruel
""
well in in a way let 's look at it from the individual point of view
""
like your fathers your fathers your own fathers
""
a father that works very hard a father that is morally upright a father that has no vices is usually is a father who is a little strict and sometimes cruel with his children
""
why
""
because he says son daughter if i can do it why can't you
""
look i work eight hours a day
""
i do everything for you
""
i 've no time for play and that 's the reason you 're prosperous
""
but look on the other hand on the father who has a number two or maybe a number three or who gambles who drinks he is very kind to his children
""
why
""
because he wants to salve his conscience
""
he wants to say look i 'm indulging myself let me at least be kind to you
""
how much will you need for this
""
here
""
what is true of individuals is true of countries and marcuse is telling us very clearly the explanation why the countries that are most cultured are without our meaning to underestimate them they 're the most cruel
""
now you might say germany is there any other country that might have been another example
""
the answer is yes
""
and that is the united states the united states
""
the united states is supposed to be the bastion of liberty
""
the united states the americans are supposed to be the apostles of what fair play democracy but look what they did to vietnam and now to iraq
""
but never mind iraq for a while
""
let me concentrate on vietnam
""
vietnam
""
what did they do to this small town called my lai  writes on the board 
""
you know what they did to my lai
""
they razed it to the ground
""
why
""
because the vietcongs were coming and they told the people of my lai we are going to burn your town in order to save it
""
what kind of logic is that 
""
i 'm going to kill you so that you won't be sick 
""
 ha 
""
and that 's exactly what it did
""
it dropped napalm bombs on my lai
""
up to now there is nothing that will grow in my lai
""
and you might say how can the united states such an advanced  cultured country how can it do that
""
could it be that something that you will not hear that uh africa ghana or where did idi amin come from something that cambodia cannot do
""
you might say oh my goodness the most primitive are the most cruel that is not true
""
the most civilized the most cultured are the most cruel
""
yes
""
""
what about uhm they were  words  japan something very uhm sexually promiscuous yet uh we had also the    words  
""
""
 uh   it is the time element that changes
""
that oversexuality came after they had already conquered everything
""
so what happened
""
the soldiers became soft
""
they had no work to find anymore so what happened
""
they started to have  catamites  look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what a  catamite  is
""
they started to indulge in in sexuality
""
why
""
because there was nothing else
""
but before that look at the legions of rome
""
the legions of rome were the most uh uhm how shall i put it
""
the most disciplined
""
why
""
because they had a lot to conquer
""
and because they had a lot to conquer they were more they were more disciplined
""
they were sturdier
""
now after that when everything was finished they are now starting to decline
""
uhm if you uh get hold or if you uhm attended my lecture on arnold toynbee sometime ago you would have known that that 's the way it is with civilizations
""
there is a kind of birth of civilizations genesis then a build-up and then once the apex is reached there is a tendency to fall down
""
this has happened in many countries
""
rome
""
rome at first it was a building of culture
""
the moment they reached the apex there is no other way to go but down
""
now let 's go to iraq
""
the united states what did it do to iraq
""
what did it do
""
the united nations just said look uh you 're going to save kuwait
""
but what did it do
""
it bombed baghdad
""
of course you and i were secretly rejoicing wasn't it
""
of course you and i were saying oh down with saddam
""
but that 's not the point
""
the point is how can a country like the united states allow such an idea of exterminating almost almost exterminating an entire country just because of kuwait
""
this is an example of marcuse 's explanation that the most civilized countries are the most destructive not the primitive countries but the most cultured countries like germany
""
wherefrom he came and the united states which is now his second country
""
do you have any questions about it
""
this is a this is a way of explaining that uhm that 's the way it goes the more civilized you are the more cruel you are
""
because take a good look which countries are producing the most destructive weapons
""
which countries
""
the most civilized germany the united states britain france russia
""
why
""
because of their civilization
""
not  in spite  but  because  of their civilization because they knew a systematic way of demolishing an entire an  entire clan or entire race
""
look at hitler my goodness
""
how could anyone in his right mind accept the doings of hitler
""
the germans would you say for instance that the germans were uh stupid
""
they were not
""
they were very cultured
""
how come they accepted
""
maybe it was because they knew that uh after all after all that is said and done hitler was there
""
he was their  fuhrer  and so therefore whatever he did was just acceptable to them
""
besides there was a carrot dangling in front of them  deutschland uber alle  germany over everything
""
and you know when you dangle that carrot in front of any nation what nation will not accept
""
even now the united states
""
look at what happened after the uhm after the the declaration of uh or the i say declaration of war it was not actually a declaration of war
""
but the hostility started on january seventeen and what did the american people do
""
they were waving flags
""
they were wearing t shirts that would reflect in order to show that we are with you
""
with what
""
come to think of it it was destruction
""
it was the extermination of a people and yet they were for it
""
why
""
because in the end they will say rah rah rah the united states
""
i am not against it as i told you we were all secretly rejoicing that baghdad after all was going to be bombed and we were secretly hoping that in one of the bombings saddam hussein would be there and dead
""
you and i are guilty
""
why
""
we are supposed to be cultured and yet at the back of our mind we are hoping that in one of the bombings saddam hussein would be one of them
""
perhaps another person who is less cultured less intelligent would not even have thought of it
""
now there you are
""
what is the explanation
""
it is because lack of play will make a person more vicious
""
any other question you 'd like to ask me
""
alright if you 've no other question then let us now go to the part of marx
""
on the part of marx 
""
marx you all know  based his teachings on hegel
""
as i was telling you last time hegel did not realize that by espousing a theory of the thesis and the antithesis producing the synthesis he would spearhead the communist movement
""
but now what is the influence of marx on herbert marcuse
""
let 's begin with the following
""
what is marx saying to us
""
why does he make a big dent on the mind of any young student
""
in other words why are there many marxists in our midst
""
and i am not going to be surprised if right here in this class there are those who are majoring in political science who are young marxists
""
why is this so
""
let me single out a few ideas
""
marx is famous for  entfremdung 
""
what is  entfremdung 
""
 entfremdung  means alienation
""
what is this idea of  entfremdung  or alienation
""
look
""
after the industrial revolution when machines started to take the place of human labor it became very clear that machines were going to take the place of what was or what used to be the work of individuals
""
let us begin before the industrial revolution
""
alright
