okay uh the activity is a year-end party for the college of business and economics and the college of engineering so it 's kind of like a celebration for all uhm la sallians not well uh we we 're aiming for all la sallians but in particular the students of both colleges it 's a year-end party so oh this is going to be on march fifteen that will be on a  saturday   yes saturday  and you 're going to hold it in rockwell yes so let me just review your project proposal objectives okay description, so it 's it 's a concert and a fashion show yes uh do you have do you do you already have sponsors for this or are you just starting to look for it well we 're we 're uh we have an idea na of who we 'll get yeah  pero we 're waiting pa for the approval and then we 'll get sponsors but we 've talked to some sponsors already so they 're just waiting for the approval of the packages then we 'll fax it to them right away uh who who 'll be going to uh be the models for the fashion show uh students or who are from outside uh outside school so there 's an entrance fee of one hundred pesos yes yeah project plan okay uh you 're angela yes i 'm angela yeah uhm projected income statement uh you 've already coordinated with rockwell regarding the venue yes they 've told you about the capacity one thousand yes yes we 've already seen it we 've already seen the place okay entrance ticket how much per ticket is it a closed venue isn't the car park medyo open well it 's open so how how can you control the the crowd well there 's one entrance lang for the cars so maybe yun yung entrance na we 'll use it as entrance yeah i mean i mean the the show the stage will it be open to other people so even if you don't go inside wouldn't the people be able to see it uh kasi it 's like this is the car park and then at the end of it at the two sides just like there 's a small land or something it 's like grass so it 'll be like enclosing the place uh-uhm and it has uh i think a wall on the side of a building so so your target solicitation will just be fifty thousand yeah, 'cause we 'll be getting a lot of uh revenues from the tickets souvenir program what 's the souvenir program for uh just for the sponsors we 'll put in the local sponsors and descriptions of the models just in case anyone would like to know okay the venue do you have uh the a moa between rockwell regarding the venue uh uh not yet 'cause it 's tentative tentatively reserved for us na pero we 're just waiting for the approval kasi we don't want okay so i 'll be needing to ask you a copy just a copy so it hasn't it doesn't need to be signed yet uh yeah we have one we just need to see to see something from rockwell showing that they are really charging you thirty thousand pesos no actually kasi the thirty thousand is still negotiable  oo  since and we 're waiting for the approval para  we can transact na  so wala pang there 's no specific amount yet how much yung venue but the maximum the maximum is thirty thousand yes thirty thousand so it 's it 's okay even even if you 'll uh be able to negotiate for a lower just show us the copy okay uhm stage design 1 word and sounds tickets tokens your total expense will be sixty-two yes uh did you include okay here it is 1 word  has seventy-five thousand this doesn't include yet what you 're going to get for the  stephen speaks   laughter i don't know  laughter the stephen speaks proposal also indicated seventy-five thousand so i guess this would be reasonable yeah  1 word has forty thousand so how much is that hundred one hundred fifteen one hundred fifteen and your expense is sixty-two thousand that 's more than enough sixty-two that 's about just half so it 's okay yes yeah alright ten percent will go to scap forty-five to eco forty-five to c b e okay uh can i need to have the paper actually signed okay laughter  you can't print the signatures we have na kasi yung signed kaya lang we didn't have the logo we didn't bring the logo so we 'll ask na lang  to sign we 'll ask them to sign again so if they could just countersign here so you shouldn't be doing this printing the signatures okay so this is okay this is good this is your solicitation letter yeah and this is the program the program and this is the memorandum of agreement between the two colleges between the two colleges so each of you would be giving fifty thousand no twenty-five thousand uh twenty-five yeah sponsorship uh so this means that uh each assembly should be getting twenty-five thousand sponsorship yeah  kasi 'cause uh the way you write you wrote this it seems that you 're giving twenty-five thousand from your funds but in case uh sorry so just try to rephrase this uh each party should be uh how do you rephrase get solicitations solicitations worth twenty-five thousand pesos so uh i thought there were only one thousand tickets uh sorry it was uh nagkamali ako  laughter  so is this supposed to be five hundred or is this supposed to be one five five hundred five hundred sorry i was thinking of something else  2 words not sell so all the five hundred is considered sold yes so that means five hundred tickets uh one thousand tickets hmm okay 'cause i 'm thinking uh when when you indicate that tickets are considered sold that you should reflect as your expense uh as expense on on us yes so this is just going to be cancelled out when you sell it sixty-two correct uh okay sixty-two sixty-two so three sixty-two fifty-five minus sixty-two negative income net loss  laughter  uhm don't you have expenses for the bands uh we 'll be getting amateur   amateur amateur bands amateur bands usually it 's free yeah 'cause they 're just starting it depends actually if we have i don't think amateur bands are play for free yeah we 'll hold out like new students you know but but how how would you be able to market the activity if you 're just going to to play amateur bands well the the amateur bands they 'll be performing for the intermission numbers of the fashion show but they 're really what the students would go for i think is partly the fashion show and the open house party it 's the party yeah it 's the party afterwards actually it depends uh if we uh okay okay because i 'm thinking that part of uh or the tickets would be you would have to pay some other organization so basically all of the uhm revenues from the ticket sales would go back to you yes so you don't have to share it with other with any other organization no okay okay the moa 's good now is it possible if you you also show the list of prospective sponsors uh okay  reads part of the document under his breath uhm try to rephrase this because i don't think it sounds so good when when you write in your letter like we would like to request for your financial help so instead uh try to say that uh we would like to invite you to be one of the partners of this activity so yours truly uh you need to yeah okay aside from that you also need to add uhm additional uhm people to sign so let 's get from nins and mr kalaw from the alumni office okay do you do you know other names no okay i 'll write down that 's under noted by or yeah actually if if you want you can yeah you can have uh just one person sign the solicitation letter so whoever will be the head of all the solicitations can you can let just one person sign so although you can still provide the contact details of the other people uh so under noted by ms kit mrs monina banaynal do you know what d s a stands for  trying to guess de la salle dean of student affairs so i 'll just write d s a okay okay and then mr kalaw vice-president for development and alumni affairs okay now uhm when i show this to ms kit she might uhm make additional comments or revisions on the letter okay although she 's not around today so the next time you return this that 's the only time she 'll be able to check the letter sponsorship 1 word uhm we normally don't allow room to room campaigns anymore so it was the decision of the different deans so although you can still uh have it during in between classes  pero but uh during classes you can't ask the teacher for you to publicize so don't indicate this anymore the rooms distribution jingle uhm streamers uhm you can't put up streamers that bear the name of the company or the product only so you can only put up streamers that indicate the details of the activity the name of the organizations the details of the activity and you can include the logos of the sponsors but you but uh streamers of sponsors that only indicate uh purely their names you can't put that so you can only put that at the venue at the venue selling it 's outside so it 's okay uhm this is good resum&eacute; of the project heads so just revise this from the other packages okay so now since this is going to be held outside we also need to fill out uh the requirements for off-campus activities uhm the off-campus activity form the yellow form the faculty conforme form so you should have uhm at least one faculty present there uhm you don't need to submit papers anymore kasi  it 's a party uh so faculty off-campus activity form faculty conforme  form uhm a copy of the map of the venue uh and the list of the officers going there going to be present there all all officers involved in the project in the project okay so we 'll be able to know who 's responsible for that activity okay and then just have this signed by uh a n b so they 're going to sign this first before you submit it to us okay  officers  so we have to revise everything uhm the corrections yeah the corrections i i although mostly are okay already uhm just the signatures uh this one you need to have this noted by your respective treasurers that 's it you just need the revisions and submit it di ba  okay  okay  okay thank you do you have any questions no uh yeah wait lang  when can we see you again anytime tomorrow anytime i 'm always here at the office okay okay thank you thank you thank you
