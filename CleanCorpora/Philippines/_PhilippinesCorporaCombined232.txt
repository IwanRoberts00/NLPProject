we start another week here on in fitness and in health  i hope you enjoyed last week when we had paulo villaruel and cheska laurel teaching us those pilates exercises for this week we 're back here to the house doing practical exercises that you can do with just minimal equipment so for today let 's do some legs if last week it was all about abs and lower back so let 's concentrate on the legs and the arms for this week all you need is a chair so that you can hang on for balance and we 'll start with some lunges okay take your legs apart like this make sure it 's wide okay keep your body nice and erect but 2 words  lean forward a little bit and then you come straight down okay we 've done this before so you know that your knees should not go past your toes this is what i mean this is what we don't want you to do so you don't hurt your knees so take it straight down and then bring it up okay take it down and all the way up now the muscles that are being worked are the muscles of the buttocks and the thighs and it is this leg right here right now that is doing the work the other leg is just following so when you come down it 's just bending also and again down lift up okay let 's just do two more two more one last like that now before we go to the other side we are going to do an exercise right here for the buttocks so you lean forward here okay and you 're just going to bring it back like this so not only the buttocks working but also the back of your thigh the hamstrings very small lifts look at my back it 's not moving and yours shouldn't be moving also so here 's the wrong way you don't want to do this keep this steady here and just lift behind now the leg in front is also doing some work you can feel that in your muscles alright let 's do two more oh and the last okay put that down just rest for a few seconds and now let 's do the other side okay start with that lunge get into a good position if you start here which is very very short here you 'll end up doing that and that 's what 's gonna hurt your knee so take your leg back nicely make sure it 's wide okay remember your back is nice and tall put your knee slightly forward and come straight down now if you want to develop some good balance you can let go of the chair and you can just do this otherwise if you feel like you 're moving around then just put the hand lightly it can be a chair it can be the wall it can even be a desk okay down inhale exhale as you come up down and exhale up that 's when you feel the exertion as you come up do it again and here 's the last great now move slightly forward here put all your weight in that leg and now the buttocks and the hamstrings behind here we go and lift just a small lift keep your mind involved in your exercise squeeze the buttocks even before you lift the leg again if you want some balance you wanna challenge your balance do it this way so you can have your arms here otherwise just hold lightly squeeze remember lower back not moving this is not a very high lift squeeze that you should be able to feel this 'cause i 'm feeling it and one more one more okay so our legs have gotten a good work-out this morning we did the lunges and we also did what 's called a leg lift extension to the back for the buttocks and the hamstrings and tomorrow we 're gonna give you exercises for the arms hope you enjoyed yesterday 's exercises which were all about the legs remember the lunges and that back lift extension but this morning we 're going to shift our focus now to the upper body and specifically we 're gonna be working out on the chest and also the muscle back here which is called the triceps now if you 're using dumbbells at home what i want you to try is to try two dumbbells in each hand for the chest because the chest is a much larger muscle and then use only one dumbbell for the triceps if you 're using water bottles which you filled up with sand my suggestion is the sand does not weigh as much as putting in things like nails or ball bearings which you can buy in the hardware so have several sets of those water bottles some of them with sand so that they will be like the one dumbbell and then some of them with the ball bearings or the nails that will be the equivalent of two dumbbells okay so let 's lie down on our mats now i 'm gonna try it with two dumbbells don't be afraid ladies that you 're going to get your muscles very big because this is only eight pounds on each hand and your chest actually can take quite a bit of weight okay slowly down now make sure that if you 're holding the two dumbbells you 're holding it well so it doesn't fall on your face take it right above your shoulder joint alright now and slowly we 're coming down and then we 're exhaling as we bring it up so inhaling down move nice and slow like this and then squeeze it up the reason i 'm moving slow is so that i 'm giving my muscles a real challenge here because we 're actually only going to be doing eight repetitions that 's the fourth and i can really feel this one not only am i moving slowly but i 've also got the right weight for my chest okay so remember larger muscles require more weight smaller muscles smaller weight alright here comes one this is the last one here exhale up okay let 's do just one more for good measure down and exhale up oh boy it 's really feeling that alright now you 're going to use just one dumbbell so get that dumbbell hold it up here bend the elbow bring it back i 'm going to put my hand here so i hold my arm steady so it doesn't move and could only move from this portion and you take it straight up okay where you put your hand you can actually feel your triceps squeezing and contracting so bring it up you want to straighten the arm but let 's take good care not to over-straighten and lock it like this yeah that 's the one you don't wanna do that 's painful on the joints you want to keep the effort on the muscles and keep your joint safe oh i can feel this one and even if this is just four pounds because we 're doing it slow holding it in the right position we 're really giving that muscle a challenge one more oh and that way now let 's go to the other side take it up again remember position it so that the elbow is facing the ceiling hold it and then straighten now think about your muscle imagine that it is a sponge and every time you contract you squeeze the water out that way you 'll be able to get the full contraction and the full benefit also you don't have to do so many repetitions but you do have to do quality repetition okay again exhaling always on the exertion and squeeze it okay one last to go and word excellent okay let 's put that down now to come up safely from here turn to your side use your hand and slowly up alright so what have we learned today we 've learned today that when you 're trying to work a large muscle like the chest which covers this whole area here you need to have a heavier weight and then when you use the smaller muscle like the one back here a smaller weight so you can't have just one weight for both of those muscles  good morning welcome to an in fitness and in health  morning i 'm tina juan and
