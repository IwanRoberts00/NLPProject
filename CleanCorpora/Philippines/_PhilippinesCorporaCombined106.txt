 words allows some teachers especially those of us who do other things other than teaching to run wild at least once in a year in the past two years i 've done just that uhm it allows us to teach the way we want to teach now i am a poet as well as a teacher i think robert frost said something about uh vocation and avocation in my case voca uh my vocation is poetry my avocation is teaching but as uh robert frost says it 'no my vocation and my avocation like my two eyes make one sight  and i would like to share with you this sight for for uh our alternative class i would like to experiment uhm in terms of creativity that is a shared kind of creativity i believe that all students have have it in their hearts and in their minds to write poetry now it might seem impossible but uhm you 'll never know unless we try  now i have i propose to do three very very simple things today i will i will share with you what i mean by creative reading and creative writing and then uh we will look into two kinds of poems one which i had done and this is written in the experimental mode we tried this out uhm we had uh a huge workshop with the philippine educational theatre association peta you 're familiar with peta and uh we had uh a festival of the arts and at fort santiago  they they placed the poem on a sheet on a large sheet of paper and uh we invited the audience to write their own poetry based on the poem because the poem is not a dead text  the poem is a living text so when you read you also make your own poem in effect so this poem can replicate itself can be written in many in as many ways as there are many different kinds of readings so i 'll be giving you the text later on and then we will see if we can do something about it uhm either uh individually or maybe by dyads 'no since this is a large group the second exercise that we will go into after we have done the first one is uh to make some very very short charms 'no  charms are one of the oldest forms of poetry and it is hinged on the idea that words can heal as well as hex or hurt do you ag do you know this do you understand this i think you 've tried this once in a while use words to love or to heal and uh you can also use words to hurt or to hex 'no like when you say madapa ka sana 'no that 's that 's hexing now in poetry it is a very specialized form i will give you a model for this we will read the model first and then you will do your own now this is not impossible because i have tried this out in uh in some of my litform course code for literary forms classes uhm the litform class that i have here uhm we will try that when we reach poetry now after we do uh the two poems if we still have time and if you still want we can go into another writing exercise uh we will try to write our our own stories based on a story 'no using uhm how we feel and how we think about things okay uhm is that clear to you what we are here for  any suggestions or comments so far  none okay uhm i will can you please help me uh distribute i only have fifty copies of the of the text so maybe uhm people can share the the text okay  okay again that as a teacher and as a poet i believe that there is a very direct relationship between reading well and writing well so if you want to be writers if you want to write more clearly you have to read lucidly  uhm how does one read a poem one goes into the heart of it 'no  so there are many levels at which you can approach a poem and one of them is and the best of them is to use your imagination when you are reading uh the words because the words have to mean more than what they are put together they should mean like music they should move you in its own melting 'no  now uhm i have written here on the board one of the one of the names that you encounter in the poem chikibu  she is uh a court poet she was writing poetry in uh heian japan in the heian dynasty and uh she wrote very very short poems which however like little dynamites they were deadly when they exploded 'no inside inside the person because then the person had to be changed forever when the poem reached the heart of that person the person was not the same anymore after reading it well or after hearing it well now iz izumi chikibu is used as an allusion in the poem sagada stills 'no which is our first text for today uhm the other person that is in that poem if you look at it very care carefully there is another name there uhm yes anyone yes you found it maskere are you familiar with eduardo maskere no you 've never heard his name say hello to him  mas maskere is a filipino he recorded with his camera he did not have any uhm formal training in photography or art of photography but he recorded with his camera a very simple one when he started the life of the cordillera and its people in the nineteen fifties and uhm a group of people who have seen his photographs have put it together in a book entitled maskere  it won the national book award in the philippines about uh three years ago and uhm he has presented to us unforgettable pictures of uh cordillera the northern part of the philippines which i think we should all visit sometime in our lives if you haven't seen the banawe rice terraces you should try to do that not as tourists but as a but as students of culture your own culture because it is i think it is the epitome of the best 'no in the in the spirit of the filipino we always hear very negative things about ourselves as filipinos but if we do that uh if we go we go up there it is a healing process now eduardo maskere used whatever light was available maybe like all kinds of artists whether you are a musician a poet a photographer uhm a painter you use whatever materials are available and then you make the best out of it now here uh he has presented uhm the cordillera i will show you some of his pictures so that you will understand who eduardo maskere is by the way this is part of good reading if we encounter words and names that we do not know we try to get to know them and love them 'no  learning is loving well if you don't love what you learn it will not mean anything in one 's life i think that 's what we mean by alternative education the ordinary education is facts what you memorize and then throw out after a term the real education is what you keep 'no and that which grows with you as you grow older and it gets better as you grow older okay here 's the picture of sagada have you have you heard of sagada it is uhm about you go from here to uh bontoc for about eight to ten hours and then another two hours through very very rough but beautiful terrain and then you reach sagada i think it is the skyworld in the philippines if you want to know how the skyworld looks like and how the sky beings used to be in the midst of the philippines you should visit sagada but again i warn you not as tourists but as lovers of your own culture  this can you see it maybe i 'll show you i 'll show this too this is the picture of the cordillera if you if you 've gone to baguio maybe about ten or fifteen years ago when you were still children and if you had a magical childhood that probably uhm made its effect on your imagination it 's uh this is the vision of the the photographer of the forest as well as of the the mountains of sagada  i think this this is one of the best uh photographs that eduardo maskere he 's he 's a self-taught photographer but uh it 's pure art because he saw with his heart   phrase of the cordillera people here 's the man who is uh the artist 'no and the singer and he 's playing on the nose flute okay uhm there 's another picture of a warrior very proud being with full dignity and integrity very very unlike many of the filipinos now  much better than many of us now  okay now i 'm showing this all to you because when i wrote that poem sagada stills it was occasioned by a a visit to the bontoc and cordillera area and uh when i reached sagada i realized what it is what it was like to imagine as a filipino would imagine but because when one writes one includes a whole world of experience one includes one 's reading also and i have read izumi chikibu uhm i 'm very much attached as a poet to the japanese and chinese uh poets and uh izumi chikibu is one of the best uh women poets that i have ever encountered one of the best poets in the entire world if you read just this haiku or it 's uh it 's a tanka it says in this world love has no color yet how deeply stained my body is with yours  now if you don't sigh if you don't understand that you 'd probably have to experience it first okay uhm now what will we do with the poem that you have uhm  will you will you please open that uh you have your text with you  this poem was recently published in the tampa review of florida and uhm i think it 's because they were trying to put together an experimental uh volume of experimental work i was trying to experiment with sheer creativity as a poet i believe that creativity is communal it is done by an individual but it is within the context of a community now since education i think effectively kills our creativity in many many ways uhm it seems as if poetry or the writing of literature is the is the province of a very select few very rare people we call them weird sometimes 'no weird weird and wild but uhm i think everyone can write if they know how to see with the imagination not just with the eyes the eyes are literal 'no but the imagination is metaphoric now it is in the metaphoric level where you can write something now when i wrote this uh poem uh as i said it was occasioned by uh a visit with a friend to this beautiful place in the philippines and i realized the the limits of art when you are in front of something so beautiful 'no  you can try to paint something you can try to catch it with a photograph maybe maskere is is uh luckier than i am because a single picture as they say is worth a thousand words but i work with words as a poet so i was trying to capture what maskere had captured now when i wrote this i tried to experiment with the visual form of the poem as you can see it there when i first finished this and i showed this to my daughter my daughter is twenty-one years old she uh yes she she said the immediate reaction that she had was how does one read this and i said exactly read it anywhere anyway you want 'no  that is my great experiment now as i said there will be as many poems as there will be different kinds of reading i will just share with you what my chinese friend did okay when he saw the text he looked at it and he said i 'll read it the chinese way how is the chinese way  yes  they read it from right to left  from right to left isn't it also from top to bottom okay so that is possible 'no  but my but my daughter was more uh playful with it so she played hop-scotch with it do you know how to play hop-scotch  step-no you know how to do that and then you jump like this you can do that with the poem too so if you are playful 'no you can play with the with the whole text and then you can make your own poem what we will do is i 'll give you about fifteen minutes of quiet to just meditate and and look at the poem and then you write your own version and after that you write there on top where my name is as author marjorie evasco and chet chan because that 's our poem okay uhm is that clear to you now before we go into that exercise let 's read that first try try to read it the ordinary way okay meaning to say syntactically in terms of its syntax the poem is trying to make some sense but like a poem it can make many other senses or many other uh meanings so ordinarily in the usual way how you how would you read a text you go from left to right or like this okay so we will try that that 's the most ordinary and maybe what most readers will do i 'll read it because it 's in my it 's my poem okay  sagada stills in a floating world if with images if with words i you could catch on photographic film on silk paper a likeness of you of me in sagada i would have you would have to set a thousand years with master of austere light measure maskere chikibu to learn the process of rendering silence of staining sound  okay i will not explain my own poem because it is a shared poem as i as i told you it is a love poem 'no okay
