she helped campaign for the elections
""
and she 's telling me all her experiences all the wild stories she
had while campaigning how the people were how much she had to do how much
they had to do and then but they couldnt they didnt win 
""
'coz there 's a lot of fraud going on as usual and yknow a lot of
uh it 's been uh the situation has been very tense 'coz there 's there 's
more than just the elections going on the power a lot of power play
""
""
yeah
""
""
yeah
""
""
'coz when you 're in power you know if you 're you 're if you
wanna push it to be where you know if there 's power  you should be uh 
be able to match that power yeah you should learn to go against it
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
if you cant you wont win
""
""
well if ever uh you do eventually you know rise up in power
 lar how can you keep your life simple if you 're in politics

""
no uh it 's it 's local government  it 's basically
management you know 
""
""
okay  but it 's so sad
""
""
what
""
""
oh nothing you know you eventually going away
""
""
i will dude trust me
""
""
yeah i know
""
i know you 'll make an extra effort to go away back to the
province
""
""
no  get away from everything here in manila
""
""
oh i thought you liked it here
""
""
what
""
""
i thought you liked it here
""
""
i used to
""
""
what happened
""
""
i dont know it 's just too
""
""
what
""
""
it 's just too uh what dyou call this  so toxic
everything
""
the traffic is bad you know the environment is uh messed up
""
it 's not a good place to raise children
""
""
oh yeah but 
""
okay  well uh honestly i cant relate 'coz i 've never i dont
have a province you know and i 've never lived in one for any period of time
""
""
well then manila is your province
""
""
exactly so this is as provincial as i can get  chuckle
""
""
yeah but i do  i can see from what point of view you 're coming
from when you talk about simple life and simple desires and simple needs
""
""
yeah
""
""
but i 'd think that you know you 'd have you 're given the
opportunity and you have so much potential going for you you should utilize
that
""
""
yeah but the thing is i could make my own opportunity when i
'm there
""
well it 's not just about manila you know
""
""
you know i 'm not saying that
""
i just dont want you to sit back and relax and do farming that 's
my point  chuckle

farming
""
""
yeah you know raise  carabaos or  chuckle  what 
chuckle 
""
""
you 're so lame you know you have this this this concept of a
province as if it were a a barrio or an undeveloped place
""
""
what did you want me to think
""
""
you see that 's it
""
""
okay you fine correct my perception what am i supposed to
think
""
i i dont even know which province you come from
""
""
you know what
""
that 's your bias so
""
""

""
""
yes it is
""
""
it 's my ignorance
""
""
 chuckle 
""
""
