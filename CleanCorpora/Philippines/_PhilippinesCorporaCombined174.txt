uh this will just be an informal meeting uh because the lasallian ambassador group is a big group so we 're about a total of sixty plus close to seventy with the old members right so this is my uh way of getting to know everybody or each of one of you personally so because of my past experiences for the past three years in the lasallian ambassadors i see them come and go and then i really don't know them personally i just know them by face or i just know them by uhm by what they do but not actually personally but how they are what do they do what are their strengths etcetera and so since you 're a new member could you just possibly introduce yourself to me say something a little about yourself  yeah  uh well uh i 'm a second year applied economics and accountancy student uh   uh-huh  so actually uh whenever i say my course a lot of the other students come to a shock but then for me it 's not a very big deal   because uhm  uh-huh  why why are they in a shock laughs  i don't know because well the course is challenging   i find myself really challenged mentally and physically challenged with all the things like right now i 'm still on my second year and we 're already on our major subjects and by next year we 'll be having our thesis for economics at the same time   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh   already  yes 'cause because regular uh regular applied economics degree takes only three years and at the same time we 'll be having our major subjects in accounting   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh  so by this time we 're already we 're already struggling trying to adjust to the academic   struggling laughs uh-huh we 're really we really are because some of our classmates they already went back they repeated the course or something like that so it 's difficult also to maintain being a regular student so so for me uhm i don't think they should gasp  about it  they just like uhm i chose this course so it 's my choice something like that  uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh speaker a makes a lot of these uh-huh assent/attending markers within speaker b 's turn of speaking; henceforth, such assent/attending markers in the middle of the turn will not be indicated but you like what you 're doing yeah i i like the course why did you choose the course in the first place uh at first per personally like before i know that my line is on the business side because of my family background and so on plus we have our business uh-huh but then i didn't want uh certain management or degree only something like that uh-huh i think it comes with the pride uh-huh uh-huh yeah then i wanted something that would give a name or sort of like if i took up accountancy i would someday become a c p a hopefully  c p a  yes yeah at least there 's a title and then for well in high school i appreciated economics so so one day i said that i want it 's either when i go to college it 's either i 'll take up accounting or economics it 's either one of the two but then when i saw the application form  laughs from la salle it was a combination so unlike  uh-huh   uh-huh  uh-huh yes you got the best of both laughs  so this is great so i just chose it and then i got in so but uh-huh i didn't really it wasn't really an aspiration or something that i really wanted to get in this course so i think it was just god 's will really that i got into it uh-huh in what other organizations are you involved here in school uh currently uhm i am part of the student council office of vice-president for academics as actually i 'm into uhm team spirit academic grievance uhm yeah so what do you do uhm basically we handle cases grievance cases but then there are not a lot of them most people like when i was in my freshman year i thought that uh the grievance team was uhm had a terrible job of handling all those cases numerous cases i thought it was very tedious well the process is tedious but however these people are the community are is not aware of their rights basically they don't know what to do about them so what we 've been doing what we 've been trying to do is to disseminate this information information uh-huh on rights and so on but then uh it 's not that   uhm efficient yet because the team is so small because   nobody wants to join it  uh-huh   uh-huh   laughs because of the work yeah perceived work yeah perceived work but then uhm for me it 's not it 's not just the work it 's also the companionship you get to know other team members uh-huh so during your stay in the organization what did you get to do already uh actually i 'm in charge of publicity so when 'cause uhm every term every midterm final course card day we set up a booth for students to like they come and consult us uh if if they have a problem with the professor and then if they think uh they would ask if they have a case or not so they consult them then we would guide them but then also the common notion that we want to uh erase is that we are not the ones who will uhm file your cases for you you have to work on your cases we 're not gonna work on your cases we will just guide you and help you but what happens is they leave that to us which is a very big problem correct correct but how can we defend you when we don't know everything about the case laughs  yeah and that what happens is we example the student is not that cooperative but then we go on with the case uh we approach the professor and so on we are the ones laughs who get the blame yes yes we take then we take the blame you 're you 're caught in the middle laughs  yeah we 're caught in the middle the students think uh they 're not uh they 're not they go like uh  walang silbi ang mga yan gumaganon sila  uh-huh uh-huh something like that so it also hurts in a way correct if you 're doing your job and they 're not doing theirs laughs  yeah have you been in actual hearing uh no no not yet not yet as of this year i there are no uh speci serious cases okay and then actually those also what we know is that those personal cases like when they say sexual harassment cases they usually uh have them in private so it doesn't go through us it goes directly to the higher uh student council  officers and then to the discipline office and so on  right  uh-huh uh-huh i see so aside from your involvement in the student council what uh other organizations are you involved in actually the other team in uh uhm acad academics group is the education expo which has been moved and moved because of a lot of circumstances uh this is with the foreign countries foreign schools yeah external linkages and hopefully it will push through in march march first week of march okay so every now and then we had meetings ganon  so on how to prepare for it uh-huh what is your role in that committee uh actually i 've been assigned as the assistant coordinator and then uh ohhh so as assistant coordinator what will you be doing i will i will really be uh hands-on supposedly on the event itself because the preparation itself has we 're not that part of it because the external linkages an office in the university uh handled it they said that they will handle everything 'cause they have the contacts  so it 's also hard for just plain students to approach these embassies so we have to they have to back us up  uh i see  course it through external linkages so they did that work for us so then our work would be on the event itself the guests their food their uh the seminar rooms yeah basically logistics  more on taking care of the guests  their needs i see so aside from the student council any other organization since freshman uh j pia = junior philippine institute of accountants j pia member since it 's our org = organization  yeah then this year uh i got into the publications so i 'm the news editor oh so once in a while we go to the events and we write about about them uh-huh what made you choose the lasallian ambassador group why did you join us basically because uh did you join did you did you have the intention to join since you were in your first year or just now or yeah i wanted to uh-huh why because i think it was a chance and you also get to know a lot of people i didn't uh i wasn't aware of all the activities of the main activity i know is the l-pep l-pep yeah and then the other activities i i know that i don't know trainings and all but then the other other activities i wasn't that aware of them until i got inside like uh like all the first activities like the christmas  salo-salo that you 'll be the one serving yes uh-huh yeah then the ushering uh-huh i wasn't that aware of them that there are other activities uh-huh uh-huh yeah so how do you find the ambassador group so far yeah they 're okay uhm they 're a fun group uh-huh laughs  yeah i guess if you if you don't have that much confidence if you if you don't get to talk to a lot of people how can you talk to your orientees during the l-pep which is very important since you 're welcoming them into the lasallian community as a representative of your school uh uh-huh uh-huh so basically you 're doing p r work for the school yeah that 's why you 're called ambassadors that 's why we choose good people so as in about a hundred or hundred plus or two hundred plus who applied we only get seventy seventy or sixty 'cause we make sure we also get the best at least those who could project good of our university di ba  so what are you looking for in an organization uh actually like what do you think could you get from the ambassador group that you wouldn't be able to get in some other groups laughs   di ba  why the hassle of going through the tedious process of screening  laughs  yeah i well i didn't really know how hard it was to get in until i was there you have to be you have to be mentally prepared also with all those laughs what do you call it uhm they 're they 're sort of the challenges yes uhm i think it was okay even though some of them were funny  1 word somewhat stupid but then it 's low confidence level that you get to build up yeah and then we also got to experience some of my friends got to experience it 'cause i celebrated my debut last july oh you did yeah so we had uhm we really had a director who taught us and then he really taught us how to uhm be more confident of ourselves so he would let you uhm he would really let you walk down those 'cause we practiced on the top on the roof top of our condo unit so every some of the residents would come up every now and then  uh-huh  ( laughs) to look and watch laughs  and they would see us and it 's really embar it 's really embarrassing to see them look at you when you 're walking down uh as if you 're modeling especially the guards when they know you laughs   uh-huh  uh-huh yeah but then that helped uhm on the event itself because you won't really mind all those people anymore you wouldn't be bowing your head so you would uh look straight and be more be more confident since uh you 're pres it 's like you 're presenting yourself for me it wasn't just my debut it was everyone 's all my  friends' debut those who participated because we 're all part of it so it wasn't just it wasn't just me because my all my friends my family all those close to me uh-huh so that 's what you 're looking for in an organization something that would help you develop yourself in terms of confidence yeah well not only that uhm i think it 's very important to know a lot of people like i 've seen it in my parents when they established their business  oh what else  uh-huh their networks yes laughs  because my mom used to work in a bank so she did have a lot of networks uh-huh from her high school and college friends her colleagues and she knew a lot of people also my dad uh-huh so the through those people that they knew they were able to be more successful in their fields uh-huh yeah and then they were also able to build their reputations even though a lot of i guess it 's normal to have rivalries uh-huh and then some people have uhm they 're just insecure uhm and all those even though a lot of people tried to destroy them but then they had the credibility they had their reputation  so it wasn't easy it 's not easy to destroy that so that 's like for me that 's what they 've been teaching us all throughout these years that uhm no matter what happens you know that you 're right you know what is right and wrong and you know what you should do so for me uh i try i 'm trying to build my reputation i got i think i have already uh in my credibility  correct   uh-huh  and you 're just trying to build up your network so it could be better known laughs  i guess probably you 'll be able to get that 'cause de la salle ambassador group uh especially the core work with the administrators and faculty probably during your uhm working here you 'll get to meet uhm well most of the people who work also in the university okay of course they will be asking you to coordinate for us coordinate with different offices coordinate with the administrators so hopefully you would be able to have that okay if you 'll be active with our group laughs  yeah how long do you plan to be with us you 're you 're you 're going to be here for about two more years i have three more three more years yeah i 'll be graduating in two thousand six two thousand six still a long way so i 'm hoping that you 'll stay with us all throughout your stay hopefully if you like the group of course laughs  and what else would you like to know about the ambassador group i don't know laughs  uhm there will be there will be five committees in the ambassador group each committee will be headed by a core we have the publicity and marketing uh publicity group we have the logistics group the logistics group takes care of all the physical arrangements for our activities from campus tours to ushering to coordinating writing letters uhm what else physic uh reserving rooms or areas that we have to use so basically the bulk of the work during l-pep that is theirs we have the h r d human resource and development committee they care they take care of uh manpower take care of training of the ambassadors whatever the ambassadors need to develop in terms of skill uhm they make sure that uh these needs are given to them or addressed and then we have the marketing and finance committee they take care of solicitation and handling the budget for l-pep and then we have the documentations team they 're documentations and research they produce the lasallian ambassadors manual and uhm they make sure that the contents are updated 'cause every year we have new information the people change the officers change departments change even the physical structure of the schools change yeah so we have to change the what do you call this the maps the maps once in a while because of the additional of one building laughs  a building disappears or another classroom appears or whatever so we have five committees that you get to choose from so given probably your skills or what you 're good at what what committee do you think would you be more uhm where will you be more what do you call this used or maximized uhm i 'm not sure yet laughs  you 're not sure yet laughs  like you 've been in publicity right you 've been in publicity   in your other involvements and you 're good in math so maybe you have a choice between what publicity or marketing and finance  yeah
