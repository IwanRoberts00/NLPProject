""
""
the official statements by the united states that there is no more renegotiation that they will either agree to or even allow   well  but uh 
""
""
 what do you expect them to say    laughter 
""
 eh sasabihin ba naman nila eh  of course  pagna-  reject eh i mean that 's the  iba-bluff-in talaga tayo 
""
i mean  mas  ma  'kung mas veterano sa poker 'yan eh 
""
so  lahat ng pananakot 'no 
""
we will be terrorized into uh running this through the senate and that we cannot do
""
 dahil  we just got it now
""
there are several folders and that is uh expected rhetoric
""
""
so  hindi kayo naniniwala kay  senator lugar senator all the other senators there congressman solarz uh stanley shregger of the u s embassy ambassador weisner
""
""
 kasi  it 's not in their best interest
""
""
uh-huh okay
""
senator pimentel any surprises uh among the documents that uh you 've had the chance to look through today
""
or was it uh purely as pre-advertised
""
""
well actually dong we we took a quick look at the  uh you know several folders and documents that were sent over just a few minutes before coming to this program and there isn't any indication that there is anything new
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
that can persuade us to change our minds
""
now mike has pointed out that uh we are all yeah we are we are indeed friends of cory
""
there 's no question about that
""
but in this particular case it is not so much the friendship that we have for our president or you know the esteem the respect and the love we have for her that are of primary consideration
""
we would look at this point in in the in the in the light of what is in the best interest of our people
""
and as rene pointed out that is exactly the reason why
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
i feel for example that the level of compensation is totally inadequate and unacceptable
""
""
uh okay i know that uh senator saguisag was probably only half-jokingly saying before the program began that he was being sandbagged because of the of the random comments we played from the public
""
but honestly that was really a reflection of what of what the people are really saying
""
and people are saying and you know this is already the argument being made
""
who are the senators to make this decision for the people when it is very clear what the people are saying
""
how how
""
""
well we are we are only the representatives from the people as mandated by the constitution   to  act on this particular issue uh on on the treaty on treaty matters that are to be entered into by this country with other countries including the bases agreement
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
that is our these are our functions as senators
""
""
okay you wanted to
""
""
well yes  dahil  it is really the fundamental question  e 
""
are we a voice or are we an echo
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
do we lead or do we follow
""
why are we here
""
because the people voted us here
""
and as i said yesterday  nga  in my prayer the only one who knew in nineteen eighty-seven as to how we would be voting on this
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 iisa lang 
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
 e ang panginoong diyos e 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
we did not know the stand of  manong  johnny of erap of butz
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but he willed that we be here at this moment in time
""
 kaya 'yon nga  the voice of god should be the voice of the people  siguro 
""
so  'yon nga  we listened very respectfully to any constituent  'no 
""
but again  'yon nga sa huli niyan eh  we consult our consciences like in the case of nene and myself
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 matagal kaming nagsama pa sa p d p laban nasa  platform  'yan eh 
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
so there was no surprise no meaning
""
we are behaving as advertised
""
""
i see
""
""
and when we were elected it was partly what we stood for
""
so there was no misrepresentation on the part of nene and me
""
""
okay what about that senator osme&ntilde;a i know you that you 've been going around the country and you 've been taking a sounding of what the people are saying on this particular issue
""
what is your uh feeling of what the people in the country is saying
""
""
well i think that the the few samplings that was done on the screen are reflective of what the people out in the countryside are saying
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
in fact in general santos uh the rotary club of general santos uh somebody suggested and said you tell those people in manila if they don't want sangley out there move it to saranggani bay
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
which is the bay in general santos
""
and that is the same thing
""
in cebu uh the students in the university of san carlos were for eighty-seven percent in favor
""
and these are students not necessarily residents of cebu but who comes to cebu from northern mindanao and leyte and negros
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
so i think that that is that is the sentiment of uh the constituency that is out there
""
now i will i will grant that under our constitution  regardless of how people may look at it the constitution says very clearly that it is our responsibility
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
the twenty-four of us to ratify or to reject a treaty
""
""
uh uhm uh uhm
""
""
and so the problem really here is that when we were when that constitution was ratified in nineteen eighty-seven perhaps we were not really looking at all the provisions because we were anxious
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
to get a constitution in place and when we ran for office in eighty-seven we all ran under the uh  mga  at what is it  pangkat ng pangulo 
""
""
uh uhm uh uhm
""
""
and nobody really examined whether the senators that we are electing to ratify a treaty that is going to expire in nineteen ninety-one whether they are in favor or not and therefore whether i would support or share their views
""
 wala namang  we were all elected uh as the ticket of cory so you know that 's
""
""
so in a sense you take that as a signal that you are allowed to vote what you really think
""
uh what your conscience really says
""
""
well it 's not a signal
""
it is the reality of it all
""
it is the legal reality of it all
""
""
let 's take a break
""
when we come back let 's start at uh with some issues
""
why why for why against
""
what are the reasons for the positions of the senators on these points
""
we 'll be back  commercial break 
""
okay before we go to substance some some mechanics
""
senator tamano is there time people are worried that september sixteen is about a little more than two weeks away
""
is there time for a real intelligent discussion of all of the issues here
""
""
i don't think the uh there is time enough
""
and that is really the problem
""
we have so little time
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
now we have so little time but there is no preparation for the eventuality that the americans will really leave come september seventeen
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
we have not even passed the uh bases conversion uh authority uh bill
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
so what we are creating here is a vacuum and that is one of the main reasons why i am for the ratification of this treaty
""
we need a breathing spell in order to prepare for the reality of the americans leaving because there is no doubt that these americans will leave
""
but let us be prepared for it
""
we are not prepared now especially because of mount pinatubo
""
""
uh uhm
""
senator pimentel does the shortness of the time make any difference to the antis  words  too much
""
would it be any would it be any different
""
""
well, the difference would be in the fact that uh the bases agreement will be scrutinized to the minutest detail
""
and all the pros and the cons of the argument will be brought out
""
but the whole trouble is precisely uh a couple of days ago rene and i stood on the floor of the senate asking precisely when are we going to receive a copy of this uh proposed agreement considering that even the the most  in  insignificant bill before the senate takes uh days if not weeks
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
to pass
""
""
so is there a real possibility that at the end of this period there will be no action by the senate
""
""
that 's a distinct possibility
""
and probably in the sense of uh just returning the document
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
 nandoon naman sa manglapus-schultz na  a committee will be formed
""
and i understand the president is selecting the members of the committee
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
for the orderly withdrawal
""
 diyan puwedeng ipasok kung ipa-  privatize  na ba 'yan dahil  one of the more onerous conditions  nga sa nangyayari ngayon  philseco cannot even repair uh soviet vessels  'no 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
anyway  itong mga  intrusions into our sovereignty
""
""
i see
""
""
 samantalang kung ma-  privatize  na 'yan ay dahil  to me  itong  asset  na ito 'no na  declining  kuno  cannot really be duplicated elsewhere
""
so i don't believe that the americans will really leave all that quickly
""
in other words uh probably what they will do is work for the election of a pro-bases president and a pro-bases senate
""
so  ano bang mangyayari diyan dahil may  special relationship  daw tayo 
""
will it be very bitter and permanent
""
will it be some kind of a lovers ' quarrel  na  after a short period they 're back in bed but under more honorable conditions
""
you know everything is possible  pero 'yon nga  it 's not as if  binomba ka na iraq o vietnam o afghanistan 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
or cuba
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 e hindi naman ganoon ang mangyayari diyan e  meaning it 's localized  'no  we suffer  'no  with our brothers and sisters  'no 
""
of course in clark well the good lord himself liquidated the problem
""
 pero sa subic ito ang pinag-uusapan natin ngayon 
""
there is a chance for orderly withdrawal
""
and whether i like it or not whatever we do now can be undone
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
in a few months uh uh by president pimentel or whoever  laughter 
""
i mean uh nothing is ever permanent  naman diyan eh 
""
""
okay now so  cough  let 's talk about what the positions of the senators are
""
senator osme&ntilde;a for example in your case you are for the ratification of this uh particular bases agreement
""
why
""
what are the principal reasons why you are in favor of it
""
""
well the the most uh used reason that i have always advanced is the economic reason
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
the repercussions upon our economy upon our stability upon the uh uh inflow of foreign investments that a withdrawal would bring about
""
and i am using this because this is the understandable
""
this is the stomach
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
the issue
""
""
the gut issue
""
""
the gut issue
""
but there are other issues  'no 
""
there 's the issue of the security of the asean and the pacific and our role in the family of nations
""
there 's the issue of uh whether or not we will isolate ourselves and withdraw
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uh there are the there is the issue of the support for our local military which i think is a real issue
""
""
uh uhm uh uhm
""
""
because our military is by the by the testimony of our own military leaders are saying that uh the military 's uh capabilities will drastically collapse if   the  uh support of the united states is removed
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
so these are the these are the other issues
""
now in the course of the debate uh those of us who are the ones who are in favor have allowed those who are against particularly you know uh abueva and a bunch of u p professors put out an ad in the papers which really angers me  'no 
""
because that 's supposed to be a citadel of truth   u p 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
it 's supported by one point three billion of public funds and it has now turned into a  wra  uh into a machine to warp the minds of the young
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and uh so
""
""
 laughter  okay alright
""
""
so you know uh they they say that it impacts on our sovereignty
""
it impacts on our political maturity
""
it impacts on our national development
""
all these arguments really have been unchallenged by us because we have concentrated on the economic issues
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but i don't accept any of these arguments that they are advancing
""
""
uh uhm okay
""
now senator pimentel just so that we can see the issues at hand what is the basis the principal basis of the anti uh at least your own personal anti vote
""
""
yes uh from my point of view dong uh the the traditional argument uh do not convince me like uh the bases are an infringement of our national sovereignty
""
because i feel that if you can vote no to the  bas  bases or vote yes that is an exercise   of sovereignty 
""
""
 exercise uh uhm  
""
""
and uh that they are magnets to nuclear attack or nuclear attack
""
i don't think that that is uh you know a a very cogent reason now considering what is happening in the world
""
