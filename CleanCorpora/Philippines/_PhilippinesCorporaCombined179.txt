well first and foremost there are what we call signs and symptoms of pregnancy symptoms usually are the patient will usually complain of nausea or vomiting or dizziness usually in the early morning which is what we call morning sickness or the medical term for that is hyper- emesis gravidarium  now is that always the case when there is a pregnant woman   words   not really not all not all pregnant women complain of this but mostly uh uh about probably seventy percent would complain about nausea and vomiting   yeah will have hyper- emesis gravidarium within the first uh up to the twentieth twentieth week up to the twentieth week now yes   doktora now are there any other symptoms that i might uh  at the latest the twentieth week  well if there 's one more symptom which we call the pica   which is   now what 's a pica  the unusual craving for food  unusual food sometimes even some pregnant women will even resort to eating clay or soil 'cause of the pica  that is what we call in tagalog lihi   pica  yes  pica  okay so are those the only two symptoms that i have to observe   most of the those are the those are the most common symptoms other symp uh other signs will be amenorrhea or the absence of menses and other another sign will be the uh what do you call this enlargement of the abdomen some of some women will also complain of engorgement of the breasts and hyper-pigmentation or the darkening of the nipples the armpits and around the neck area uhm now doktora about the darkening of the nipples would that go back to normal yeah it will after pregnancy it will okay so i 'm just curious chuckles  now the second question is  laughs uh but the diagnostic of course the only  ti the only time you can be sure that the patient is pregnant if  you will get a positive pregnancy test or the you can see it in the ultrasound that there is a baby in the womb  pregnancy test  uh is that possible even in two weeks or one week old  the ultrasound   yes uh uhm uh i see okay so my second question is uh how do i take care of my wife for example if uh she 's pregnant what are the special precautions that i have to watch out or i mean what is your suggestion about it well pregnant women are usually most of the time they feel lazy they 're so sleepy you just give them uh provide adequate rest and if they are suffering from hyper- emesis gravidarium you can give vitamin b complex or some an anti-emetic like bonamine just bonamine yeah would that not affect ano have any effect on the baby the bonamine   no that 's safe for pregnant women uh that 's safe and of course you give them pre-natal vitamins and iron preparations because when the patient is pregnant uhm she would need all the supplies on her body to be   words for the baby   yeah because uh yeah the baby uses up the iron in her blood and calcium supplements also sometimes are needed so now what foods do you suggest actually a pregnant woman can eat anything she wants ex  uh but of course   except me laughs  no but of course we would suggest nutritious food for her for her good and for the good of her baby uh we would shy away from junk food because that has no nutritional value  right  soft drinks all the more because it just contains sugar and the weight will just go to the mother not to the baby yeah okay now what are the critical months that i have to watch out is it the first the second it 's usually the first three months or the first trimester  because during this time the baby is just being formed  uh-huh  so during this time it is uh if the mother gets sick or she takes medicines that are not allowed the baby can turn out to be deformed or with congenital abnormalities in in the first month   after the third tri after the first trimester all the baby does is grow up so most of his parts are complete already  yes  how about the last trimester  is that also the critical ay a critical stage that it might be a premature birth if something happens   it depends it depends it depends case-to-case basis case-to-case basis because like placen placenta  previa or abruptio placenta they usually happen later on uh-huh so you just have to be that 's why it is  necessary for the pregnant woman to go to  to prenatal check-ups monthly  well   uh-huh   now i have a cousin monthly prenatal check-ups   and then every two weeks starting on the seventh month and then weekly on the on the ninth month  uh-huh  now what if what would happen if uh during the first trimester  uh my wife would contact what do you call this uh  bulutong tubig ano 'yon  chicken pox chicken pox yes what would happen i mean would that be a big effect on the baby or or what or would that have no effect on the baby at all  or nobody is sure  well  you can never be sure if y uh sometimes we get pregnant women who get chicken pox early in their pregnancy but the babies turn out normal what is the most feared sickness during pregnancy is german measles  or rubella because chances are the baby will come out deformed  uh i see he will have congenital cataract microcephaly  or small head congenital heart disease and all those other things  and ment mental retardation also so we really have to avoid german measles yes now if you get rubella shots speaker b coughs  if is that advisable no not to pregnant woman to to single women or pregnant  wo single before getting pregnant  'yon nga if you have to get a rubella shot you have to wait six months before you can get pregnant uh i see or else or else the vaccine yeah it might affect the baby also within six months now now i 'm a dentist and i want to know do you suggest local anesthesia for extraction during pregnancy as much as possible minor surgical procedures should be deferred until after delivery unless it is absolutely necessary if for example you have an impacted molar which is causing the pain  the patient so much pain   intense pain yes well you should have to weigh the the pros and the cons the benefits for the patient and possible adverse effects to the baby uh okay if it 's absolutely necessary then now it is up to you now for example it is just a filling if it is just   a filling   do you use local anesthesia for filling yes we use local anesthesia now now what would happen if i use local anesthesia what  what are the effects would it go to the placental barrier or or would just pass the baby or what do you think would happen i 'm not so sure about local anesthesia but we usually advise them to avoid as much as possible   to avoid as much as possible okay so the interview is finished as of now and thank you very much any any further questions laughs  okay thank you  tapos na  yes dr del fierro judging from your uh uhm from my your opening remarks i suspected that maybe you had a change of heart regarding this  yes   about  your signature no i don't have a change of heart i don't have a change of heart and i mentioned it again to uh dr  mendoza  so but that 's alright i wish uh you could all sign it  and uh i have nothing i have nothing against the propositors  but signing it uh i can't   we have  it 's really up to you but i judging from what you said you made it appear that you would be in favor of such a proposal this morning  no i hope that i did not  i hope i did not i said let me see what did i say i said that i know that there is a move for his uh extension and that uh whatever might be the case uh you are against his extension in other words i am well i would say i am against the extension of uh it doesn't have to be to be uh francisco mendoza you know  but uh i i i i 'd like to stand by the uh present policy of the uh of the uh faculty manual  okay but i think  but it does say in the manual that on a case to case basis   uh people can be extended so if it were you i think we would do the same thing if it were dr quito we would also do the same thing  uh uhm  no i if it were i don't want any exception but there have been exceptions there had been but that was in the past that was during the uhm andrew administration but isn't this age discrimination uhm well then that 's a new philosophy no it 's not  it 's not a new philosophy  it 's a  it 's just that uh it 's just that i uh well i feel that there must be some retirement  would would the  yeah well it need not be sixty-five in fact it can be earlier in fact it could be later too it could be later but uh but in the case uh of some faculty members who retired they 're hired on a part-time basis yes and they are still considered competent you know yes no problem with that   so then what 's the point well the point is that uh if there 's no movement up there there would be no movement down here yeah but there is a movement there is a movement  there is a movement down here and we 're doing it  and once  no a movement in the sense that uh up here among among the seniors there must be movement uh but this is just cronyism isn't it we are all intelligent people i think we have a right to say what we think yes of course of course and i think we we have arguments to support our case so go ahead i mean uhm i i wish you the best and i have no i 've nothing against that your view prosper but uh i should hope not but anyway i think uh like i said before i think it 's a gesture and uh the point is uh when somebody has retired and then they turn back and re-hire him on a part- time basis to me it seems like exploitation  uh uhm  well then if uh the person feels it is exploitation then i think uh the thing to do is not to uh not to teach yeah but that 's a very cruel argument  because some people some people just don't have a choice when they turn sixty-five uh they don't have many other options and they 've been loyal to an institution and they 're still capable especially in an institution of ac academic learning an institution of intellectuals the mind is more fertile at that age  no  yes even even even later and uh so i mean kant uh wrote his work on religion when he was uh way over sixty right right and so you see for me it 's sometimes uh i just think that people should state what they think in order to avoid injustice i have no disagreement regarding that that the 1 word should continue words   the way i see it you know i just see it i think the way i see it very frankly is i think if there is some kind of solidarity here then uh i would expect your support uh uhm you see 'cause otherwise uh uh the chairman just becomes uh you know he stands in opposition to the faculty but if the faculty already has expressed its support i think uh a chairman should be should show his solidarity that 's not necessarily the case so i mean i 'm giving you the uh this has always been this has always been the okay well of course it 's your decision and this is not obligatory but that 's just the way i see it so i just want it to be out in the open
