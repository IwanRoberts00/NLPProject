""
about  uhm  what 's the story the story 's about uh  the relationship between
""
""
between   a father and a daughter and 
""
""
 a father and a daughter   then afterwards as they as the   kid grow older 
""
""
 as the   yeah
""
""
yeah what happened is that their relationship becomes different
""
""
their relationship became different why  break in the recording 
""
anyway what happened to that young girl when she got older what happened
""
""
when she got older uhm their relationship was strained
""
""
why
""
""
i no the here 's something because the girl grew up in manila studied in manila and
""
""
and then
""
""
and she 's from bohol i think
""
""
uh i see
""
""
and then uh there was a gap
""
""
yeah
""
""
between uh as she grew   older 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
you know there was a you know there was a gap uh between them and then finally before the girl left
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh 
""
""
what happened to the girl  she grew up
""
""
  you know 
""
""
 why was the   relationship strained
""
""
i really i i i think you really need to   read  so that you can really understand because if i 'm going to tell   you all these things it 's 
""
""
 to read it  
""
 explain things to me  
""
okay what about youngblood two
""
""
what about   youngblood two 
""
""
 you 've read it   already
""
""
yeah some are nice some are not really that nice
""
""
  but it 's okay 
""
""
 you were talking   about gender  sensivity  sensitivity  laughter 
""
""
a while ago
""
""
a while ago
""
""
no uh yeah yeah yeah yeah
""
""
i read an article about uh about gender that 's   not  really  re  related to what you 're  sa  you were saying a while ago
""
""
 yeah   okay
""
""
it 's about uh 
""
do you believe that guys are really good in math
""
""
i i i i i think generally guys are good in math i mean they 're better off than girls when it comes to math
""
but for say for the for the arts and the languages i think girls are far better   than guys 
""
""
 you really   believe or
""
""
i guess i mean that 's an observation
""
""
that 's an   observation 
""
""
 yeah   why
""
""
because we were discussing a while ago in our class uh last time in our class we were discussing about  cough  uh guys are really better in mathematics   than girls 
""
""
 are they  
""
""
there are researches   made  and we were discussing why
""
""
 yeah  
""
why why
""
""
uhm  the thing uh the reason that we have was that uhm guys are really better in mathematics perhaps because of our culture
""
because   before  remember before uh   time  of plato   and socrates 
""
""
 why  
""
 i mean  
""
 so you 're you 're speaking   about uh so it 's not not not just the philippine culture  break in the recording 
""
""
international   research 
""
""
  ano  okay   yeah
""
""
it was really known and there   are so  many researches that shows you know
""
""
 and then  
""
and why is that   regarding plato and 
""
""
 researches that show   uh if you can remember uh those uh philosophers before  they were allowed to you know only guys were allowed to study mathematics   remember 
""
""
 uh   uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
""
""
so girls are not allowed and then we were saying
""
""
they were not allowed to study   mathematics nor  were they allowed to neither were they allowed to study   yeah 
""
""
 yeah because  
""
 because   they 're they were second class   creatures 
""
""
 yeah  
""
denizens  laughter  okay
""
""
critters  laughter 
""
""
okay
""
""
no uh
""
""
and then
""
""
and then we were saying that what we have now although we are always saying that there 's equality between you know men and women what we have is the residual effect of that chauvinistic culture   handed now  to   our culture 
""
""
 uh really  
""
 handed down  
""
and then
""
""
but there are no researches that prove that the factors but they are just assumptions that we are saying     because all all the researches are saying perhaps guys are really good in mathematics but the question of why   was not   cough  explored
""
""
 uh  
""
 yeah  
""
i was thinking of a     more biological reason for that
""
""
 what do you think  
""
biological reason
""
""
like perhaps what what part of the brain functions uh for math  wha  uh
""
""
left
""
""
yeah left okay
""
perhaps uh the left part of the brain of the guys work better
""
""
but if   you  can
""
""
 or  
""
""
to think that   there are  also girls who are   really excelling  in mathematics
""
""
 than girls  
""
 uh yeah yeah  
""
but generally it 's the guys who excel in   math right 
""
""
 because that   was our culture before
""
""
uh   okay 
""
""
  di ba    like engineering are only for guys      di ba 
""
  so arts  are only for girls
""
""
 yeah  
""
 but   why do you think girls generally succeed in the languages than guys in languages rather than guys
""
i mean  do you owe that to culture also
""
""
perhaps because     language is    in a sense a weaker 
""
""
 not really    chuckle   like like   girls
""
""
weak
""
""
weak what
""
""
a weaker
""
""
a weaker
""
""
uh a weaker science unlike math it 's a hard   science 
""
""
 so it needs   analysis
""
and language doesn't
""
""
even psychology  di ba 
 we don't see   guys in  psychology
""
""
 women psychologists  
""
uh really but but the proponents but much most of the proponents in psychology are
""
""
nowadays but before
""
""
like   sigmund freud 
""
""
 most of them   are girls
""
""
yeah really
i never thought of that
""
""
that 's why in psychology because it 's uh nowadays uh they are already promoting   in  school
""
""
 yeah   yeah but languages languages why or arts
""
isn't uh girls uh go for arts more than guys do
""
""
i don't know i don't think so
""
""
or or   the number 's  just equal
""
""
 because in   architecture classes  di ba 
""
""
there are more girls than   guys 
""
""
 there are   more girls uh there are more guys     i think you can see and architecture is an art an art form
""
""
 uh yeah  
""
uh oh yeah
""
""
so it doesn't really follow but come to think uh there are only few girls in architecture classes right   why 
""
because of our culture    
""
because we are saying that architecture is only for guys  di ba 
""
""
yeah  yeah  
""
 because our culture dictates  
""
oh yeah
""
i took that up with uh my class last summer when i taught so-an sociology and anthropology
""
and that 's it we were discussing about what professions uh uh in what professions do guys usually dominate and what professions do girls usually dominate
""
and that 's it like what professions do girls usually dominate
""
these are teaching     the teaching profession nursing
""
""
 yeah  
""
nursing
""
""
like most of our nurses are  girls most of our teachers are girls what else
""
and i i i i i even pointed out to them that i had a classmate in college before who took up education and like his friends were trying to tease him about it why why are you taking up education   are you gay  or something
""
something like things like that
 if you also take up nursing and you 're a guy like hey are you gay or something because our culture dictates that this profession is only for girls and this profession only for guys yeah
""
""
 yeah that 's true   that 's true
""
""
engineering
""
you know there 's this anecdote about what was that
""
uh a boy and his father meeting an accident and the  fa  uh the father 's boy what was that
""
and the boy and his father meeting an accident and the father uh a vehicular accident at that and then the father died on the spot
""
so uh the people who witnessed the accident uh brought the kid or the boy to the hospital
""
and when the boy  rea  and when they reached the hospital they called for a surgeon
""
and when the surgeon arrived she exclaimed oh i couldn't i couldn't operate on this boy
""
and then they were asked why
""
and then the surgeon said 'cause he 's my son
""
""
 chuckle 
""
""
so who 's the surgeon
""
""
the what the mother
""
""
the mother
""
and what most of my students said oh perhaps the the father who died in the accident was just the foster father and things like that because usually we have this notion that surgeons are male or males or guys yeah
""
""
 chuckle  like in the story of one of our teachers last time
""
uhm in a mathematics class  cough  he gave uh examples of maria painted the room  cough  twice as much as
""
""
yeah yeah yeah yeah
""
""
you know the usual problem in mathematics and then all of the students are you know     reacting like there 's something wrong
""
we cannot solve the problem because     there 's something wrong in the problem because maria doesn't really paint
""
i mean the usual thing
""
""
 what  
""
reacted
""
 why   uh
""
""
maria don't paint   maria  cooks  laughter 
""
""
 okay  
""
so if the problem was stated that maria cooked more recipes than whatever or went to market
""
""
she doesn't paint   she doesn't paint  she doesn't you know do carpentries   like  some old culture  laughter 
""
""
 she doesn't paint  
""
 okay  
""
yeah or like plato what plato doing the laundry  laughter 
""
""
i don't know if it was plato or socrates     who who had eight female teachers i think
""
""
 who  
""
eight female teachers
""
and then what was the implication
""
""
but it was not even mentioned in the articles
""
""
yeah
""
""
why because men are not really that significant before
""
""
women
""
""
uh i 'm yeah i mean women
""
""
women are really not not that significant before
yeah
""
how would you attribute that to what would you attribute that
""
like women weren't really that significant because  weren't really that significant because  how did that originate
""
do you know
""
""
uhm
""
""
like we we were born we grew up in a patriarchal society wherein boys rule over girls
""
why
""
""
perhaps perhaps it can be traced back uh to activities of the society before ancient society
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh  where  guys are the rulers
""
""
yeah
""
""
but you see cleopatra
""
""
oh yeah cleopatra but was she a ruler
""
""
was she a ruler
""
""
was she a ruler
""
""
because usually uhm girls are  you know on their emotional side
""
""
yeah  is that uh scientifically proven like girls are more emotional and guys more logical 
""
""
i read an article about that uh i 'm not convinced
""
""
yeah   it 's because  you know uh
""
""
 you know  
""
it depends upon the culture where you 're growing it depends upon the environment you know
""
""
yeah
""
""
the environment shapes you  di ba    so 
""
""
 yeah   because in our r s class before we had this hand-out no not  hand  it was really a book it was compiled
""
the the the articles there were uh compiled by fr yatco and then yeah he  whe  when we went into the topic of marriage of marriage uh that 's it he mentioned that uh why should men and women be what  understand each other
""
then we he he enumerated the things that men should understand in woman women and women should understand in men like men are basically what  silent that they don't talk much
""
""
oh yeah that 's true
""
""
yeah   is that 
""
""
 women   talk much
""
""
women talk much do they
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
i guess so
""
my mom and dad are like that
""
my mom talks more than my dad does
""
""
they nag more often  laughter 
""
""
mothers nag more often obviously
""
okay what else
""
what 's the difference between men and women
""
""
the thing that we you were saying a while ago     the thing that you were asking i mean about gender what was that
""
""
 what  
""
gender
""
""
yeah  socializa  uh there are words that you know
""
""
uh yeah that uh like there 's this study that uh showing that gender defines what  social language
""
is that is that the term or something
""
that uh men have  diffe  have a different language quote unquote from women
""
do you believe in that
""
""
yeah perhaps perhaps   like i have 
""
""
 like men   speak in different language
""
""
yeah because like like us   we  cannot talk about  i mean private things like
""
