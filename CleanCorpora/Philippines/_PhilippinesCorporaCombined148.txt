hello again i 'm gene orejana you are on-line for another issue in the day with the chief financial officer of meralco the treasurer rafael andrada welcome on on-line mr treasurer good evening gene uh let 's put a historical perspective into this discussion about power and the power sector in the country looking back ten years ago in the nineteen nineties we had this crippling power crisis  now what do you think caused that that problem well uh we as we all know right now uh the the power crisis was was primarily caused by by two major factors  uh uhm   one is a is is is uh misforecasting the inability to be able to plan properly for the requirements of a a an economy that 's taking off  okay  uh uhm and second is the inability to attract the right kind of investments uh to ensure that uh you would have players coming in to to provide uh generating uh projects uh uhm uh uhm now the inability to attract investors what brought this when in when in the nineteen nineties the philippines was one of those highly regarded by the foreign investment uh portfolios as one of the best in asia to put your money but at that time why were we not able to attract the foreign investors in the power sector well i i i think it 's uh primarily because of uh the the structural reforms needed to uh to provide uh a a a transparent playing field for all investors uh in the country has not really seen it its its fruition yet  uh uhm  uh uhm it was started early in the aquino administration but uh it has to take some time to be able to to get uh investors uh confident uh with uh with the environment in the philippines uh uhm we all know that the economy suffered in that in that period but how do you assess the performance of the economy then was it way below because of the power crisis or did this power crisis uh uh stunt our growth to the present uh well definitely at that time as you you you could remember most of our asean peers were already uh uh have already taken off uh uhm and uh we were still be uh being saddled with a very basic infrastructure problem which is uh supply of electricity uh uhm uh uhm   and that is very keen critical as far as ensuring uh investments to come in and businesses to flourish uh uhm uh uhm uh it it uh and and and in in in that context that 's why i guess uh we were pretty much late in in in seeing some economic development uh vis-&agrave;-vis our asian peers  uh uhm  would you say that the condition of the oil prices the the the rate of of uh crude in the world market at that time in the nineteen nineties contributed to this power crisis uh the the spiraling cost of electricity at that time well actually i i i i don't think we saw significant amounts of uh rate uh increases uh in the early nineties   uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm  it was really more a basic problem of supply infrastructure that 's correct   uh-huh uh-huh and maybe policies also of the government yeah well you have to allow uh uh some gestation period and maturity for certain certain initiatives by the government to be able to sink in to the uh investing public  uh-huh   uh-huh  uh uhm now comes this warning of the washington sycip policy center saying that in the year two thousand four we may or we might again suffer another debilitating power crisis similar to that of the nineteen nineties why is this so because they they added that uh power demand will exceed by the year two thousand four because of population increase in in industry in industries and all those things but is it forthcoming well the likelihood is is uh is is uh very clear if we do not get additional investments or investors to come in to build up new power plants  uh uhm uh uhm   okay  uh uhm uh the current situation in the industry is such that uh there is uh currently some some level of overcapacity in terms of power supply okay uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm and that overcapacity was brought about by uh uh our our our want or need to be able to ensure that that uh supply would be in place hopefully to address uh agri-growing economy uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm but uh we had seen the finan uh uh the asian crisis uh couple of years ago and that stunted our growth  uh uhm   okay  uh uhm now we 're not seeing the demand uh coming in to take in the supply  uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm uh you would have to be able to ensure that there would be certain structural reforms in the industry uh to allow a more transparent level playing field under which uh investors could put at risk their capital and hopefully gain some uh gain some profits uh and returns uh from those investments  uh uhm   uh uhm  the government and the proponents of this proposed uh power bill restructuring the country 's power sector pin so much hope on this proposal that could revolutionize or well liberalize our power sector but juan de la cruz the man on the street doesn't see along that line because they feel that whatever you do in the power sector power rates will always remain high as it is we are known to be the second highest in asia next only to japan in terms of power rates when when in fact japan is a such a highly industrialized country and the philippines is not but we have the second highest rate in the entire of asia why is that so well uh as far as uh cost of uh power 'no it it primarily the biggest component of uh the consumers' bill is uh practically made up of the uh the generation charge 'no   uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm  and uh at this point in time the the major supplier of elec of of power is is is national power corporation uh uhm now because of certain uh policies uh that uh that used to be implemented with respect to cost subsidies as well as uh uh providing certain services in unviable areas and then together with the need to be able to fast-track uh the addition of new capacities to solve the the uh power crisis in the early nineteen nineties   uh uhm uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm  napo the napocor cost structure uh had had ballooned to a certain extent wherein now you have the cost of uh power in the philippines generation at the generation level much higher than the retail rates of five or six asian countries uh uhm uh uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm  so that makes uh the philippines uncompetitive as far as uh electricity rates are concerned uh uhm uh there is a lot of hope that 's being pinned on on the omnibus power bill because it hopes to be able to institute certain reforms and restructuring in that industry  yes  uh uhm so that you could enable a more transparent uh and market driven pricing for your cost of electricity  uh uhm  as i 've mentioned uh napocor currently is the major supplier  with with with the uh deregulation bill which seeks to privatize break up and privatize uh napocor 's generating assets into several competing companies  uh uhm  uh uhm together with the possible uh other uh independent power producers that would compete with those uh with those uh generating companies of napocor uh should allow market forces to bring down the rates  uh uhm  uh uhm allow me mr andrada to say again or take the point of view of juan de la cruz in the in the aspect of in the matter of the oil deregulation law uh which the proponents sold or the selling point they used to to pursue this oil deregulation law was that market forces will determine prices of fuel and fuel price could be more accessible to the public because of market forces now again in this proposed power bill restructuring the country 's power sector the selling point is again being used is that prices would be more reasonable because of the play of market forces but for juan de la cruz it isn't so why can't we not have that kind of philosophy or or perspective from juan de la cruz who feels he is already a victim of that strategy used in the deliberations of the oil price dereg uh oil in industry deregulation law uh uhm well uh one is that uh there would be as contained in the omnibus bill uh draft of the lower house there would be a mandated five percent reduction in uh in uh cost of generation which will get back on to the consumers  uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm uh this is a definite this is a definite five percent reduction it 's it 's not cosmetics uh uhm uh uhm the consumers will see a five percent reduction in their bill uh uhm now the second aspect is that you have a more global open uh situation under which uh under which uh power generation companies compete  uh uhm  uh uhm uh no longer is it uh relegated to a regional basis but it 's on a global basis you have u s utilities or even uh european utilities uh having very strong presence in asia because they believe there is significant amount of potential  yeah  uh uhm but they compete amongst each other and uh i think the beauty of this is that anyone and everyone who has the the ability to to uh to to think of of investing and providing the capital could actually compete in the power sector  uh uhm  uh uhm but why is it so hard for the power sector to convince the public that a deregulated a restructured power industry sector could lower power rates in the end well maybe i think it 's uh because the public has never seen uh such occur in the philippines yet 'no and even in asia 'no uh but  uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm but if you look at uh global trends countries that have deregulated there are countries that have deregulated uh as early as about nine or ten years ago and some only as recent as about two or three years ago uh the end result has always been uh substantial real savings for the consumers uh uhm uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm in fact uh some countries now uh their consumers are saying i have so much electricity at a cheap price i don't know what to do with it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so we hope that kind of a trend would actually translate and transpose itself in the philippines when when uh the industry gets deregulated on the generating side currently meralco has almost one and a half million subscribers in its franchise areas in the in the cities and provinces that we have mentioned laguna quezon batangas nineteen towns in pampanga metro manila bulacan rizal and cavite well uh three and a half  three and a half   three and a half million consumers three and a half uh-huh yeah three and a half million consumers right now in the next five years the economy is expected to grow to grow by an average of five point eight percent how much would this kind of factors affect the viability of meralco in the next five years uh what kind of pressure would this put on meralco operations in terms of rates in terms of its expansion projects its distribution and maintenance  uh uhm  well uh meralco would have even without looking at an expanded market uh uhm uh uhm uh meralco normally has to spend approximately three billion pesos a year in capital expenditure programs just to maintain the system  uh uhm   uh-huh  okay because uh well the normal wear and tear it 's an outside uh plant it 's an outside system exposed to the elements there is normal wear and tear  yeah  uh-huh uh-huh and that means constant replacements and upgrades uh uhm uh uhm uh besides uh most of our a significant component of our transformers and circuit breakers are already over thirty-one years old thirty-one years old
