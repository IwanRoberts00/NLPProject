uh mr president uh honorable colleagues today the senate is blessed with this historical moment faced again with responsibility and opportunity to be able to choose in these times of widespread discord and national prerogative that has a concrete bearing on how we can preserve our sovereignty and the security of every filipino reflected in this document are workable solutions providing for the very existence of our republic in a world besotted with conflict rage and insecurities this document will not only be the source of foreign policy direction the republic or this administration has to take but it will without doubt confer us the necessary framework to prevail over waves of changes that will engulf the unwitting and the ill-prepared this document has been the source of bitter exchanges personal attacks and harsh pronouncements within this hallowed chamber and even out in the street the other parliament every channel has been opened so that clashing viewpoints would be heard not only in the exercise of the inherent and constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression the state maintains open channels because it seeks the wisdom from what is spoken not just from the bombast we all let it loose so each one every senator casting a vote the citizen ventilating concerns can find the appropriate care and define the balance of national interest and foreign policy initiatives on what could be the end of the post cold war years in a republican state international agreements are appropriately subjected to intense debate because these cannot and should not be crafted on the basis of the whims of the executive the r p visiting forces agreement is not just simply about military exercises nor of nuclear weapons nor of ugly americans or of prostitutes neither merely of ravaged environments and menace of drugs and disease it is all this and more the resulting interplay of economic politico-military and socio-cultural forces in a new global dynamic shall determine how the v f a and those who shall father it are branded or remembered irrelevant or relevant subservient or nationalist the debates have all prepared us for this task and warned us enough how to bear the consanses consequences of our vote words  and immediately and far-off into the future although they had the chance in nineteen eighty-six the framers of our constitution did not reject american presence outright the framers of our constitution sought a balance of patriotism and pragmatism consciously they so worded foreign policy and the transitory provisions to the nineteen eighty-seven constitution to allow us to savor the challenge of this historic vote they did not find wisdom in taking away the options of the executive towards enhancing national security and assuring peace with our shores within our shores the senate on the other hand also found enough reason to wait out to wait it out for four years in nineteen ninety-one the senate did not extend the bases' stay they plainly let the r p - u s sem um m b a lapse when the last ships of americans and their dependents left eight years ago the people in the senate these same hallowed ch chambers left one of the foundations of future filipino-american relations the mutual defense treaty intact unchanged unchallenged but today more than ever we know and feel it in our guts that we need a new framework to put more meaning and muscle to commitments under the r p - u s mutual defense treaty a treaty that we did not abrogate a treaty which the people rejoiced the ejection of the american bases did not press to abrogate even with three changing of the guards in congress i believe the decision made today should be based on the most important factor national security defined correctly and in the long term external defense and the protection of territorial boundaries not only not only external defense and protection of the territorial boundaries but also increasingly of economic security in a world directed towards globalization where peace assures us and our neighbors equitable use of resources in the region as human contact across oceans reach new levels and frequencies just recently unimaginable we now realize that we are interconnected not only in the physical sense but in the plane of changing international morality played out in interregional and global engagements foreign relation initiatives must reflect the correct appraisal of the values of alliances it is easy to claim that one is against war and easier still to invoke the constitution which renounces war as an instrument of national policy however i believe no responsible leader can play blind to real and potential threats to peace equality justice freedom cooperation and amity with all nations it is not enough to denounce aggressors and it is fatal to be an island by itself we should not be trapped in the web of insecurities ab attributed to being neutral neither should we couch as to throw ourselves into the camp of the bigger bully as if wishing that another holocaust will break up we have to wield foreign relations instrument to reap the benefits of a security continuum which allow us to struggle should be juggle  arrangements and employ initiatives ranging from one that is entirely neutral to that of dependence to a superior power depending on the need of the times we have to take a calculated pace in this security continuum basic to finding the reasons to confront options in this security continuum is having the courage to face new and emerging configurations of the new global dynamic and after a continuing assessment of the new global dynamic to slowly but surely enter multilateral and bilateral arrangements geared towards self-reliance i understand why others find comfort in old patterns characterized mainly by unequal ties betwan between the philippines and the united states and as breaking away much later there too was comfort in the belief that the u s what that this threshold of declining influence in the initial embarrassments and the very vivid images of its pull-out from vietnam handling of this whole hostage situation in iran and its being booted out from the philippines the image of the u s on the brink of collapse was reassuring the favorite line was that the u s enjoying a peak would soon in a rage bring down itself and its allies in a war of its own undoing likewise the u s s r 's grip of its satellite was slowly slipping after it went into a wave of changes. the rising nationalism of u s s r 's component republics led to the formal internment in nineteen ninety-two of an ailing soviet empire the end of the post cold war was carved deeply into men 's minds when the one raging symbol of the cold war the berlin wall was pick-axed and bulldozed in eight in nineteen eighty-nine the mad men 's game of the arms race was gone the cold war was over and mr president we pretended being secure within our shores we lulled in the feeling we that had an even chance of having peace after breaking the suffocating yoke of a former colonizer and its only rival splinter a period of disengagements the integration reassertion of political and cultural independence erasing old spheres of influence of the great powers characterized what we commonly term the post cold war world this was a unique period in modern history no big war was dividing the world the various causes were fought by swift troop attacks including government-funded mercenaries and terrorists that stretch of time so the great powers waging battles that were still about controlling continents without the use of the giant talents of armies which constituted the panorama of the two world wars this period showed the enlargement of the the demec democratic world in the u s efforts in panama the break-up of the soviet empire and china 's political reforms the two germanys reunited while other eur european republics splintered into smaller nations the soviets rev uh withdrew from cuba middle east conflicts simmered to the accord between israel and palestinian liberation organization and in the meantime mr president that democratic space expanded in turkey and other eurasian states the manifestations that this period will not hold and was only temporary was present but we failed to read through the fine print muddled as we are and merely stared at the unfolding of the tapestry of global events the post cold war world was headed to a conclusion kosovo may just have done it i subscribe to the analysis that we are coasting through to the conclusion of an interregnum a gap between two tempests the crumbling of the berlin wall and madeleine 's war a lot of us gathered here missed the interregnum unbeknownst to us we also just managed to exist in a superficial peace without exerting any efforts to craft a comprehensive foreign policy relevant to the security of the filipinos' future the importance of the crumbling of the berlin wall in geopolitics was lost on us as the aquino administration used it only to shame local insurgents if not for the large army of filipino workers the government would have also looked the other way when iraq 's ins expansionist wars in the nineties had to be stopped by united nations-sanctioned desert shield and its bombardment in desert storm these two events should have signaled the aquino cabinet to immediately craft and strategize on an independent foreign policy then we would have had the opportunity to that should be thus  nullify the old valid charge of the great nationalist claro m recto that the philippines has a mendicant foreign policy this also explains why we are lost with the impact of the realignments in the post cold war world the government missed the signals that was alerting us to the possibility that the superficial peace being savored will be broken the wars in far-off shores are impacting on us while swelling wars inside our neighbors' yar yards are threatening whatever was holding peace until nineteen ninety-eight the united states the only remaining super power had worried about serbia iraq and north korea currently it is forced to reckon with the strength of russia france japan and china russia is now in the process of reu reunification with the fragment of its old soviet empire in nineteen ninety-eight russia found a center of gravity in anti-americanism sparked by the unannounced u s bombing of iraq driving a wedge into the russian psyche that power to spoil u s actions had slipped away powerlessness was the russians' collective shame because the returns were never realized the in-flow of american investments and loans had drastically constricted therefore it sought a reattachment with china a renewed alliance with china will counter aggressive u s pressures to acquire increasingly russian economic cooperation the u s now has to consider france after its effort exhibited in iraq it may be the u s forces that are leading nato forces but it does not monopolize the directions and the ultimate conclusion of the serbian drama japan poses another challenge to the u s despite clearly securing its sovereign through american military presence its independent assessment of the north korean threat already felt in pentagon meanwhile china let cannot let its economy weaken or be artificially propped up it wants to emerge to be a stabilizing factor the most conservative of u s policy makers appreciating the global aspiration for peace reflect this in their recommendations as follows safeguard u s national security through a non-proliferation policy on nuclear weapons prevent a major power threat to europe east asia or the persian gulf through a u s permanent power position in the pacific maintain access to foreign trade through nafta and actively seek open markets to benefit american consumers and exporters protect americans against threats to their lives and well-being by decisive action against terrorists and international crime syndicates maintain access to resources the most strategic of which is foreign oil which supplies half of american needs i find the enumeration very revealing mr president they are all realizable only if a peace holds mr president who would have thought that the giant responsible for decades of anti-capitalist propaganda and one of the foremost critic of the western money economy would one day hold a free-market superpower america perplexed at the power of its own currency who would dared should be would have dared imagine the western currency speculators included that china could hold by its pocket an america fearing the slightest movement of the u n china underwent two massive disarmaments and later switched from an old-time preparedness against a large-scale war of aggression to peacetime construction its defense budget is minuscule compared to the other great powers mr president worldwide it is cooperating in the u n and in other multilateral initiatives designed to control the spread of nuclear weapons prevent arms race in outer space destroy biological weapons suspend export of anti-personnel landmines and reduce the forces in border and on non-first use of nuclear weapons china has also agreed with neighbors to refrain from staging military exercises directing against the other and restrictsi restrictions military exercises as to scale area and the number of such military exercises despise should be despite its multilateral peace efforts china is still feared mr president some persist in fanning the fear of a chinese invasion and to a certain extent it is indeed worrisome that there exists such a big army without a declared enemy and moreover construction of structures and occupation of certain areas without agreements fuel doubts and apprehensions while fighting off u s rebuke of its human rights record china was taking in the lessons so magnified in its decision to preserve hong kong the crown jewel of mercantilism at as the port of global trade china understands the strategic value of not waging a war that will dissipitate dissipate its resources for it is to construct ports or deploy troops in overseas bases would detract from its benign deportment that it had painstakingly sustained through extreme self-restraint in addition the feared asian giant is as much threatened by factors of instability if we can only care to read through its defense strategy with regards to china mr president i believe that foremost in the u s priority is its economic potential as when the u s sent its straight-shooting albright to join its trade secretary to propound america 's interest it is one it is but one example that the u s itself took cognizance that an engagement or any ari any rising rivalry with china would have to be waged sustained and resolved within economic terms and not in a fiery war now mr president should we be afraid of china today a search for relevant foreign relations initiatives i reiterate my belief that while conflicts have ceased to be waged on ideological grounds we need to forge security alliances the new global dynamic is anchored on the protection of national interests of great powers such as those of japan china russia and some other european states
