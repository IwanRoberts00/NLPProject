""
uh it 's always good to come home
""
whenever people ask me uh they always like to ask uh  o  how are you doing how 's everything and then they they try to bait me into making a comparison between de la salle and u s l s  audience laughs 
""
of course i will never buy it
""
i simply say well you know i work professionally at de la salle but i only have one home so that will never change  audience claps 
""
okay uh when eli wrote me uh i was i really had no hesitation to to accept this invitation
 'cause i think it 's good for us to to come together and and just i think the mere act of of reflecting and trying to make sense of what we are experiencing as a people  'no  and uh also trying to deal with sometimes honestly you know extreme feelings of uh frustration and sometimes even almost despair at you know what is happening
 because uh i think those of us who are old enough remember that when we went through that after we went through and we got over the edsa experience and the marcos dictatorship i think we thought that was it  'no 
""
we were looking forward to uh uh i guess a quiet and nice peaceful existence
""
uh of course cory 's term i think that woke us up early enough that it wasn't going to be that
""
uh ramos 's term we uh i guess we were sort of lulled into almost a false sense of security because things seemed to be looking up
""
then when the nineteen uh ninety-eight elections came i think you know what some of us did
""
uh myself i broke an old vow i promised never to get involved in partisan politics because of the obvious uh difficulties it could present to our institutions but i broke that and you know why  'no 
 because i had a tremendous fear uh that if this popular candidate would win we would be in for a very very difficult period  'no 
 but after he won okay again i threatened to go into exile but i did not
 uhm instead i think like most filipinos uh who believe in the constitutional process i said let us see let us give this administration a chance
""
so we did that
""
we tried to work as as much as we could with the uh estrada administration
""
uh you even know that i made a rather unpopular decision which cost me heavily
""
uh it can be told now when i agreed to accept an appointment in this so-called constitutional convention the concord  'no  uh i was told later on that some of our faculty members at de la salle uh actually wanted to ask for my resignation because of that involvement
""
of course it never got to that and we went through it and i guess you know it 's history now concord was shelved
""
for the record i would still like to say though that if we had given that a chance i think it could have helped the country a lot but the timing i guess was not right uh  basta  many factors so it 's all of those the work we did for about four months
""
i don't know if you ever found time to read that  'no  the proposed amendments to the constitution but i think they would have helped a lot especially in terms of uh encouraging what foreign investments in the country uh in terms of correcting the flaws
""
there were some real flaws in the nineteen eighty-seven constitution but right now well that has been shelved and has since been overtaken by events
""
but the point i 'm trying to make is that as i said like most uh filipinos i wanted joseph estrada to succeed especially and i would pray hard for him to succeed okay and i really wanted him to succeed 
 but in the end i guess when this whole thing blew up uh what last october when the uh you know as as the revelations started to come out initiated by governor singson and now as we hear more and more in the senate then i guess it 's sort of my worst fears were were just were were were borne out and therefore there is really if there was any doubt there 's really no more doubt in my mind that uh the best thing for the president really is to resign
""
and that 's why when this broke out if you would remember de la salle manila was the first i think the same day that u p came out with its statement uh we came out with the statement calling for the president to resign
""
and uh since then i think like you uh we 've been watching the impeachment and uh well we can talk about this maybe during the open forum if you have questions but anyway i watch the same uh t v channels you watch
 although i guess i just have one advantage i was able to physically attend uh some of the senate hearings 'cause i wanted to see directly how the senators would behave to see and uh get a sense a feeling of where uh they are going to to vote  'no 
""
so this is where we are now and uh i 'd like to uh just analyze the situation with you a a little more uh deeply if we can  'no 
""
so the current situation is that there is an impeachment trial going on uh now on its what fourth week depending how you count fifth week depending on how you and as the evidence comes out for us non-lawyers i think all we look at is the substance  'no 
 uh although it 's fantastic uh again i said as i watch this i knew it i should have been a lawyer  audience laughs  i said i would have made a very good lawyer because so many things that you know are so obvious to me you know and to some people
 but as a non-lawyer uh i mean the substance to the evidence in this court it just simply confirms  'no  the the unbelievable extent of the greed and the corruption of this man  'no 
""
uh you know one witness after another uh especially the more credible witnesses just telling stories that make you quite frankly sort of ashamed that you 're a filipino
""
you know that you have a president who you know would do these things resort to these things
""
so however i think like you we also realize that uh this is gonna be tough
""
many people uh especially the hard-nosed uh what uh observers from the very start have said you know uh he 's going to be acquitted in spite of the preponderance of the evidence and they give you uh many reasons for that  'no 
""
uhm number one all he needs is what eight senators to to acquit him and it seems we know who they are
""
now there are others also that uh are sort of borderline maybe you can count about eight senators also who are definitely going to convict him and some in between  'no 
""
but the numbers are certainly in the president 's favor plus the  cough  of course it 's still unconfirmed rumor but uh you you know in manila when the rumor persists i think you can almost be sure there is something to it
""
and the rumor one rumor really that refuses to go away is that a billion pesos you know has been set aside to make sure that these eight senators will get handsomely rewarded for a verdict of uh acquittal  'no 
""
so those are the stakes that we are uh in a sense that we are up against
""
so  the economy let 's look at the economy the current situation
""
uh about a month ago a month and half ago i talked to one of the highest ranking finance officials of the government and uh well because i was trying to persuade him among others to resign
 but he told me his reasons for not wanting to resign  and i said okay so i listened and i didn't want to argue with him  'no  uh but the most important information that he gave me was this
""
that was last i talked to him in november and at that point he said brother we only have the government has money for the next five months we can run the government up to march
""
the senate had been able to borrow some some monies but after march if nothing gives if there would be no significant changes okay the the economy will really be a very very serious problem  cough 
""
the i i think again you don't have to be an economist to realize the the macropicture
""
uhm i think foreign loans have stopped
""
i think the world bank i m f  cough  i think they would not give us any new loans until this political crisis is resolved somehow
""
uh foreign investors uh are are not coming in if anything they 're pulling out and of course big business and this is critical  'no 
""
almost all of the major business leaders uh makati business club and even the very you know the conservative uh p c c i  'no  uh have withdrawn their support for this administration
""
so with all of these factors the economy again of course uh if you listen to the economists uh  marami silang mga  projections which probably are are true
""
they 're saying when you put all of it together what are they saying our first two quarters next year  pwede pa 'no 
""
they claim that we would not yet really feel the the really ill effects meaning uh rise in unemployment uh rise in inflation okay uh 
""
so all the indicators they feel will hit us in the third quarter
""
that 's what they 're saying and recession if it 's going to set in would uh set in maybe in the second half of next year
""
uh so that 's the state of the economy
""
and what is clear what is clear at least from from where where i sit is that there is no turning back as far as some of these key players are concerned  parang wala na 'no 
""
uh as every day that president estrada continues in office you know will lead to this you know will lead to the further deterioration of the economy
""
that 's the situation
""
okay so let 's just take a closer look at uh what are the questions
 the first question the question i 'm often asked is so what 's gonna happen brother is is he going to be uh would would the president uh be able to survive this
""
will he stay on in power or would he be removed
""
i think it 's important to look at the key factors contributing to either his his removal or his stepping down from power what uh versus his continuance
""
uh i think the critical factor that could lead to either his his impeachment his conviction or his resignation is really public opinion
""
now this is i think eli was trying to make this point  'no  that the president must get the very clear message
""
that the public opinion you know increasingly would call for his stepping down from power
""
now how do you communicate that to him
""
well there are many ways uh but in the end it 's going to be public opinion
""
it will also be public opinion that will that could tilt the balance among the senators
""
don't forget i think about five of them are going to run for re-election
""
uh many of them are planning to stay in politics and only a few are are not going to uh continue in politics
""
 the senators  of course they are very sensitive and this has already been tested many times
""
if you 've  fo  if you 've been following there were many times that we were not sure how the vote would go
""
for example remember when the defense panel was trying to block the testimony of uh clarissa ocampo
""
in the end i think the senators called for a meeting called for a caucus and they unanimously decided to allow clarissa uh because of public opinion
""
i think nothing else  'no  because i think they knew if they had somehow blocked her testimony uh you know they would have had a lot of explaining to do to the public okay
""
uh another factor that could still lead to his uh uh conviction in in the senate  the quality of the witnesses
""
if you notice the first batch of witnesses were all most of them are connected with chavit singson  'no  and most of them are somehow related to him or working with him so  parang pwede mong sabihin  well they have you know you could question their their what their their credibility because of their connections with singson
