cheezee sauce tenderloin steak with cheezee sauce
""
 alam niyo ang gagawin natin dito  we 're going to use
beef tenderloin or  kung gusto ninyo  you may use a pork
tenderloin also or  yung  chicken breast  'no 
""
okay so take this recipe down  napakalinamnam ho nitong
reciping 'to 
""
 gagamit ho tayo ng  cheezee sauce  ng 
magnolia
""
very first ingredient for our recipe this morning is we have four
pieces of pork tenderloin actually pork  yung ginamit natin dito pero
pwede kayong gumamit pala ng  beef okay four pieces of pork
tenderloin steak or any kind of steak any cut of steak
""
 eto tingnan mo ang ganda nitong  pork tenderloin
 na 'to ang laki o 
""
okay and then we have one teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of salt
""
one teaspoon of pepper one teaspoon of pepper
""
we have some uh two tablespoons of magnolia gold butter two
tablespoons of magnolia  go  gold butter
""
and two tablespoons of uh olive oil two tablespoons of olive oil
""
we then have one-fourth cup of magnolia gold butter one-fourth cup of
magnolia gold butter
""
we have some white wine one-third cup of white wine
""
we have one cup of all-purpose cream one cup of all-purpose cream
""
 meron tayong  uh one-half block of magnolia cheezee
one-half block of magnolia cheezee
""
 tapos meron tayong  one-half teaspoon of salt
one-half teaspoon of salt and one-fourth cup of parsley chopped one-fourth
cup of chopped parsley
""
okay what we will do here is we will get our uhm  teka muna
ano bang gagawin natin  okay olive oil two tablespoons of olive oil
you have two tablespoons of magnolia butter
""
and the reason we 're doing this is so that  may lasa ho itong
ating uh pampiprito natin dito as ating  pork tenderloin  pero
hindi ho masusunog dahil mabilis hong masunog ang  butter  'no
""
""
so we 're going to  parang  temper it by adding
something that 's more heat resistant in the form of olive oil
""
now  ang gagawin natin dito  is we will mix our salt
and pepper okay and we will season our pork tenderloin
""
okay season our pork tenderloin  ayan tapos baligtarin lang
natin 
""
you know  meron akong uhm paniniwala dati na ang  pork
tenderloin  'no  especially or pork  yung mga 
roast pork and everything  ay kailangang  well done  'no
""
""
and more often than not  totoo ho yun  but then when
you find out when you know the source of the pork  kung nung saan ho
nanggaling  let 's say  alam nyong malinis ang pinaglakihan
nung baboy talagang  you know in sanitary surroundings and everything
then you can cook the pork even medium medium rare  may mga kumakain
ng mga ganyan 'no pero dito sa pilipinas  usually well done 
ho natin kinakain yan 
""
but you know the moment you know where the  yung 
source  ng  pork  e palagay nyo nakikita nyo yung baboy
na naliligo malinis po yung pagkapalaki sa baboy  then you can have
it uh less than well done okay

 now  yung ating  sauce  naman ang gagawin
natin dito  is very simple
""
we will just get our butter one-fourth cup of butter ohhh 
mainit din yung ating ano  pan but  gagawin natin para hindi
masunog ilagay natin kaagad itong ating  white wine okay
""
 ilagay natin itong ating  all-purpose cream
""
actually this one is just a matter of simmering all these ingredients
together well  para hindi lang uhm masunog lalapot ho nang husto yan
ilagay natin ang ating  salt okay
""
 tapos pag  nag-  melt na ito ito isi- 
simmer  ho natin itong ating  sauce for about  siguro
mga  fifteen minutes okay
""
 ilagay natin yung ating  magnolia cheezee one-half
block of magnolia cheezee okay

 chopped parsley  pala ayan para lang medyo maganda ang itsura
nya titingnan natin 'to ito yung ating mga  pork tenderloin 
dito 
""
look at that okay
""
wow  ang ganda o 
""
 alam nyo ang napansin ko dito yung ating mga baboy dito sa
pilipinas ay malalaki na  and i think these these are uh imported uh
 yung  pigs  na dito na pinalalaki kaya tingnan mo
 even the size of our tenderloin the pork tenderloin  ay
napakalaki na rin ano 
""
so all you do here is just simmer this until it 's nice and reduce
 siguro mga babawasan ng mga  one-fourth  nitong
 sauce  na ito  and you will serve this uh on top of

to make is uh i 'm sure the title rings a bell because we 've done something
like this before but this one is different in the sense that we are going to
marinate our pork in a dip and fry it as such  'no 
""

""

ingredients together well
""

""
okay and then we add in one whole egg
""
if you have any comments suggestions recipe requests please write

""
wait let me get a wire whisk here
""
blend these ingredients yeah
""
you know the presence of the cornstarch will add crunch to this
dish
""
we add in our shallots
""

""
i 'll remind you again you don't have to just stick to pork chops
""
whatever suits you chicken or veal if you want lamb if you want
""
okay garlic we add in our sugar
""
we add in our shrimp paste
""
and blend all of these together well
""
blend all these together very very well like this
""
okay
""
and we will coat each chop each cutlet with this mixture
""
and let it sit for about i would say about an hour in the
refrigerator so that each piece absorbs the flavor that you 're trying to get
""
you know a dish like this requires a lot of rice with rice 
masarap po masarap 
""
 halo-halo lang ho lahat yan 
""
okay
""
then keep it in the fridge
""
okay now let 's say let 's say this one is nice and marinated
already we will start frying
""
okay  tingnan natin ito 
""
okay this is going to splatter i 'm sure
""
yeah
""
okay this has to be cooked fully okay
""
 di naputol itong  cut  na ito 
""
and then like this okay
""
and maybe you can have this with some chili catsup if you want uh
thai chili catsup
""
okay look at that some of this sauce
""
you know this shrimp paste is a very popular item in asia okay
""
they have uh different versions of this
""
they they have some that are made out of uh shrimps tiny tiny
shrimps some that are made out of fish
""
you know what they do and they  ma  when they  ma 
make  nampla  i visited a place that made  nampla
 before they get shrimps dump it with plenty plenty of rock salt
and let that age for about a year and then the juice of that they would uh
extract the juice of that they would make  nampla  out of
that  'no 
""
uh the rock salt will pull out the juices of the from the fish and
they would make fish sauce or  nampla  out of that
""
and then the remaining fish they would grind to make uh what we
call  bagoong balayan  or what uh what 's  th  i don't
know what you call it fish paste or shrimp paste okay
""
so this one all you have to do is just fry it the moment this is
done it will be nice and crunchy it is ready to serve
""
pork cutlet with shrimp sauce guaranteed delicious
""
you 'll love this  1 1
