all of these uh issues uh we are to deal with this afternoon uh your honors involve uh the jurisdiction of the senate to try and decide  alleged acts of the respondent not alleged in the articles of impeachment there are subsidiary issues with respect to certain accounts because they are not in the name of the respondent i will deal with them at the end of my arguments i have uh distributed if your honors please uh a a copy of the pertinent portions of article two of the articles of impeachment together with uh a brief statement as to what are the conclusions therein as well as the allegations of fact there are two kinds of assets if your honors please which are involved uh in these uh subpoena duces tecums as well as the second envelope first are the alleged mansions particularly in the case of the second envelope what has been referred to as the boracay mansion the other asset involved are cash assets or their equivalent which are involved in all of the other subpoena duces tecums it first it should be recalled if your honors please that under article eleven of the constitution the house of representatives shall have the sole shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment no other body has that authority not the senate not any other department of government on the other hand the senate has the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment a case of impeachment comes before the senate if your honors please in the form of articles of impeachment which are sent to the senate by the house of representatives the power of the senate the sole power of the senate to try and decide a case of impeachment cannot go beyond the allegations in the articles of impeachment issues now before the court revolve on article two at the preliminary conference the first preliminary conference held among the parties it was agreed that under article two the issue would be the following whether on the basis of the facts and i underscore the word  facts alleged therein the president would be guilty of graft and corruption once again i underscore the word facts  let me now invite the members of the court to go through the pertinent provisions uh por uh the pertinent provisions portions of article two copies of which i have distributed it says president estrada violated the constitution and he stands guilty of graft and corruption  those that clause if your honors please is a conclusion of law it is not a statement of fact then it proceeds to state when he participated directly in the real estate business through a family-controlled corporation which constructed thirty-six townhouses in vermont park executive village antipolo city as shown in the p c i j in the article on president estrada 's family and financial interests  that clause is a statement of fact the following paragraph reads he also violated the anti-graft law he is sworn to uphold  that your honors is a conclusion it is not a statement of fact and then it the following follows he filed his statement of assets and liabilities for the year nineteen ninety-nine stating therein that he and his wife and children have business interests in only three corporations  that your honors is a statement of fact following that is the sentence the president by that sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth that your honors is a conclusion then what follows is this statement of fact because it says  records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets open parenthesis annex c zero close parenthesis statement of facts in the last sentence reads and i repeat  records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities parenthesis annex c zero  nothing more your honors so let me start with the easier one cash assets there is nothing in these articles of impeachment which states that the president failed to declare in his statement of assets and liabilities cash assets nor in the second does he in the second sentence do we find any  impli uh any any statement of fact about assets because in the second sentence it simply says records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities  so what is alleged as a factual basis of the assertion that the president violated his sworn statement by committing perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth incidentally there is no such offense as simply limited to the failure to state in his statement of assets and liabilities other that is other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities as i said insofar as the cash assets there is nothing whatsoever here now it will be noted if your honors please in annex c annex c is a comprehensive list of corporations in which the respondent is supposed to have other interest which interests rather which he did not declare in his statement of assets all in all these corporations number eighty-eight corporations some table two of the president table three guia gomez table four laarni enriquez table five joseph victor ejercito table six selec selected companies of estrada and his families so insofar as corporate interests if your honors please what need to be determined is whether in the case of the second envelope st. peter 's holdings is listed is among these corporations listed in annex c as far as the second envelope is concerned if your honors please  we may assu we may deduce from the application that the intention is to establish that the check which was supposed to have funded the payment for what we call the boracay mansion purchased by st. peter 's holdings was funded in ultimately from savings account o one six zero six two five zero one dash five and that is why what is sought now to be produced is the statement of account for october one to thirty-one nineteen ninety-nine it may be recalled if your honors please that uh when on december fifteen uh december twenty the first envelope was opened it was found that in that envelope there were the applications to open accounts specimen signatures etcetera of account number and uh one one zero two five four nine four da dash five as well as microfilm copy of the equitable bank check numbers those were what were in the first envelope now what is now sought to be produced is the statement of account of a savings account which we assume the prosecution contends will show that the check which was used to fund the price for the payment of the what we call boracay mansion in the name of st. peter 's holdings was funded from this statement from this account savings account so in effect what is now asserted is to prove that the president was the one who acquired the boracay mansion through st. peter 's holdings but as we have stated st. peter 's holdings is not among the corporations listed in annex c there is one other flaw if your honors please after the first envelope was opened which should have been the premise assuming uh my assumptions are correct in regard the second envelope not any of the documents in the first envelope was marked as an exhibit so that if the papers in the first envelope are the predicates for the opening of the second envelope that predicate does not exist because the papers which were found in the second envelope have not been marked as exhibits much less established as belonging to break in tape   missing words the issue of relevancy they go to the issue of jurisdiction whether the jurisdiction of the senate to try and decide this case goes beyond can go beyond the specific factual allegations of the articles of impeachment it is our submission that the senate is without jurisdiction to try and decide any accusation based on any act other than those which are specifically alleged in the articles of impeachment now as to the other subpoenas if your honors please they are accounts even far removed from the account supposedly related to the acquisition of a property by st. peter 's holdings they involve cash assets or their equivalent well perhaps as far as the accounts of president in the name of president estrada and the first lady assuming that cash assets are contemplated are covered by the articles of impeachment we may say they are within the jurisdiction of the court but you have other accounts uh which are the subject of subpoena  duces tecums  some of the subpoenas apply uh for subpoena duces tecum  to be directed to account numbers without any names how can the relevancy the fact that these are within the juris  within covered by the articles of impeachment be determined on the basis of the application similarly you have this kevin garcia jose velarde and other names which are not in the names of the president and not even in the names of laarni guia gomez they cannot be presumptively they cannot be deemed as presumptively belonging to the respondent there is one other noteworthy fact if your honors please regarding these applications for subpoena it will be recalled that uh it was agreed among the parties that when a subpoena duces tecum is applied for the particular check if it be a check which would show the relevancy of the application would be indicated and that beyond that there cannot be a comprehensive or catch-all phrase to cover all documents and records in that account these applications for subpoena duces tecum  have sought to circumvent the agreement that there should be no comprehensive clause in subpoena duces tecums addressed to banks what the prosecution has done is to list everything that one may find in a bank account or ledgers or accounts except that instead of saying that all ledgers all accounts they have now specified this one by one that is why if your honors please the applications for subpoena  duces tecum s have have uh enumerations of documents covering about two pages in single space of documents as a matter of fact if your honors please in the case of the second envelope if assuming the materia assuming that that is within the jurisdiction of the senate what should only the subpoena duces tecum should be limited only to what is necessary to determine whether the check that was drawn on the current account was funded from the savings account it would be inappropriate even assuming that purpose to expose the entire statement of account for that month much less other documents pertaining to that savings account as a matter of fact uh assuming that the court does not sustain us on the jurisdiction issue and that uh the prosecution 's desire is simply to establish that the check was funded from that savings account we would be  abl be willing to stipulate that assuming that that is the purpose so then if your honors please the issue is not really that complicated but it is an issue which we have raised many times in this uh trial unfortunately there has really been no definitive ruling on this perhaps it is time that a ruling be made because what has happened really when the first envelope was opened we raised that issue but then the whole the documents had already been exposed and so we said since the matter has been made practically public uh we agreed not to pursue our motion for reconsideration but reserving our right to object on the matter of materiality or jurisdiction similarly when the clarissa ocampo testimony was made we likewise objected but the testimony was allowed to be given although conditionally given so the issue before the court if your honors please is simply whether the articles of impeachment contain any allegation of fact to show that the act the alleged act of the president in having cash assets or interests in corporations other than those listed in annex c are sufficiently alleged in the articles of impeachment so that the senate would have jurisdiction to try and decide them
