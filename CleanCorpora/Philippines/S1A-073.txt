""
""
i can't believe he stood me up with a gay
""
""
how would i know
""
""
 pero si   willie  there 's something
wrong with  larry  but that doesn't mean  willie  is gay
""
""
well  willie  is psychologically insane  laughter
 fifty percent
""
""
and mental uh physically disabled
""
""
i refuse i refuse to believe that i mean as if i didn't hear
anything about it
""
""
which one about  willie  or about  larry 
""
it 's sad if he is gay
""
""
he is gay
""
""
he may not be gay because he sometimes he goes out with one of
our friends who isn't gay
""
""
if if a guy goes out with a gay
""
""
 mo  most likely he is
""
""
most likely
""
""
but how come how about  larry 
""
""
goes out with whom
""
""
 rocky 
""
""
 rocky  is straight
""
""
exactly
""
so he 's not
""
there goes your theory
""
""
   si   larry  
""
""
  kasi parang    it could be just a
one afternoon   date   laughter 
""
""
 how pathetic   hello hello duh  laughter 
""
how pathetically yours
""
""
 laughter    so uh  that 's the revelation
and he gained a lot of weight
""
""
  nay    he gained a gained a lot of
weight
""
""
as in he has already a beer belly
""
""
because of the  ano umiinom  he drinks a lot
""
""
probably   laughter 
""
""

a long time ago
""
i don't remember how   he looks like 
""
""
 but he doesn't look gay  di ba   
""
""
he   looks 
""
""
 probably   he 's a girl trapped in a man 's 
 body 
""
""
 body  
""
""
he had a girlfriend before
""
""
so that 's why
""
""
yeah but nothing happened

 laughter  it 's subject to rebuttal  laughter 
""
""
it looks like like i beg to disagree
""
""
about him being gay
""
""
no
""
""
or not being gay
""
him   being gay 
""
""
 he is gay

like he had a girlfriend and this girlfriend became so 
malambing  with him
""
i don't know how far she started kissing him and she just he just
broke off
""
he didn't like the idea
""
""
because 
""
""
because
""
""
he probably doesn't like something something like a public
display
""
""
no they were inside a room
""
""
which room
""
""
the girl visited him
""
  his house 
""
""

""
""
wherever

""

""
""

""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
he now owns that  employ  yeah well i really don't know who

""
""
okay
""
""
 laughter  i 'm getting confused i guess
""
""
oh
""
""
there   so anyway 
""
""
 oh   is it something like  anyway anyway
anyway anyway anyway
""
""
 teka ano  baby girl or boy
""
 jerome 
""
first born baby
""
""
i don't know no idea
""
 basta  he got married march
""
""
okay   march 
""
""
 his wife   gave birth recently   a month or
a few months ago 
""
""
 march april may   okay oh okay yeah
""
""
so it it must be premature  speakers b and c laugh 
""
""
is it nine months or is it down payment
""
""
premature or
""
""
maybe premature but the baby 's normal  speaker b laughs
""
""
so i guess prematurely normal
""
""
full term
""
""
full term
""
""
yeah okay    ibang  term  term
""
""
  laughter  but premature   from wedding
""
""
there are women who would go old instead of sleeping their
way
""
""
uh
""
""
  yeah it is possible 
""
""
 because   because
""
""
if you put it that way it makes sense
""
""
yeah
""
""
'cause i couldn't imagine  pepe  uhm trying to get his
way with a girl before they get married
""
i don't think it   came from him  the idea of going to
bed with her
""
""
 look at this  
""
but as you said he was given a house by the family
""
""
who
""
""
by the girl 's family
""
""
he just said
""
the girl 's   family gave him a house 
""
""
 by the girl 's family  
""
""
yeah
""
 di ba  you said he was given a house  speaker b
laughs 
""
""
probably not me
""
my sister
""
""
yeah yeah yeah it was  word  yeah
""
see what    that 's a good uhm 
""
""
 the reason why  
""
""
incentive
""
""
yeah exactly  di ba 
""
""
to procreate
""
""
you know nowadays or gay nowadays
""
""
but now   other women have beliefs 
""
""
 and gay men  
""
""
 ha 
""
""
have such the same belief as others going to bed with men
before engaging in the sanctity of marriage simply because they want to know
if they 're sexually compatible
""
right
""
wrong
""
""
but that 's not the case with this couple
""
""
yes
""
""
i think he just wanted to be
""
""
and generally speaking
""
""
 oo 
""
""
can you run that by me again
""
 ano 'yon ano 'yon 
""
""
again again   again 
""
""
 again   again okay  speaker c laughs 
""
""
not a lot of women although how how the world corrupts your
mind
""
""
oh
""
""
not a lot of women would go to the extent of going to bed
with men before getting into marriage the sanctity of marriage simply because
""
""
they want to know if   they 're sexually  com 
""
""
""
 society yeah   society dictates it and because
they want to know if they 're sexually   compatible or whatever 
""
""
 but because   but because
""
""
there are other there are other women i know that have still
kept and believe in the
""
""
sanctity
""
""
sanctity of marriage and you know maintain your self pure and
what have you
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
before you enter into something like that y'know what i mean
""
""
yeah but as you said  nga  some women like to
check their sexual compatibility
""
""
i don't get it i    but i don't get it 
""
""
 i guess for   them it 's a lifetime
""
""
  commitment 
""
""
 commitment   so since they 'll be doing that the
rest of their lives
""
to each his own
""
""
well yeah well i respect the idea of others it bothers me
""
""
but in this case this girl really wants to get pregnant 
 by him  because
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
i think for filipinos most of the time that 's the reason why they
go to bed with a guy
""
""
to hook the man
""
""
yeah not to try out if they 're compatible
""
""
uh uhm
""
well speaking   from our generation 
""
""
 really  
""
""
from our generation i guess
""
""
 oo nga   laughter 
""
""
we 're way
""
""
i was just about to say that
""
""
yeah
""
""
really
""
""
i can't speak for the other girls   the younger ones
""
""
""
 exactly  
""
""
i   can't 
""
""
  oo   nga 
""
""
but i mean but you see it even now younger girls sleep at
avery early age
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
exactly just like someone who 's twelve years younger than me
""
""
and
""
""
and proud of it
""
""
 oo nga 
""
""
well she even said good luck to you
""
""
uh yeah   yeah 
""
""
 in front   of all the men 
""
""
like saying hey paint the town red
""
""
exactly
""
and she even said it 's good i already did it
""
""
  she did what 
""
""
 she made it look   as if i was so pathetic
""
i was explaining that i i 'm happy the way i am
""
  i  hap   i 'm happy with my choice
""
""
 uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm
""
""
and then suddenly she   just 
""
""
 it 's a choice you make  
""
""
exactly
""
and then suddenly she just whispered loudly whispered  
loudly 
""
""
 loudly  
""
""
yeah she really really made sure i would hear her and say it 's
good i already did it
""
""
hello
""
""
yeah  parang 
""
""
to each his own
""
""
exactly it 's sad
""
they they find me pathetic
""
""
she 's pathetic because you 're not those are things you 're
not even supposed to talk it out with
""
well   it depends on the kind of approach 
""
""
 that 's our point of view   that 's our point of
view
""
to them it 's just like
""
""
and you know the thing is about sex
""
i think  if you just tried it once twice even up to ten times
you 're not in the position to say if it 's really good or not
""
i think it you should have tried it at least uhm   basta
 more than twenty   times uh 
""
""
 a regular   regular
""
""
or on a regular basis to know if it 's really enjoyable or
not
""
""
but i but i think the way i see things  kasi 
i agree with you but then the way i see it it 's i think supposed to be
enjoyable when you do it with someone you love   with someone you 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
  you  word  
""
""
 that 's how we were taught   that 's how we were
taught
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
to be with for the rest of your life
""
""
uh uhm uh uhm  pero 
""
""
that may sound very conservative but that 's
""
""
yeah no no  tama 'yon 
""
 kaya lang  for someone someone like her i don't
think she 's done it too many times   unless  she really sleeps
around
""
""
 yes  
""
  exactly 
""
""
 but i doubt it  
""
so   for some 
""
""
 yeah   i doubt it also
""
""
a young girl like her to say  na  to talk like
uh she knows so much about sex
""
""
exactly
""
""
uh unlikely  e kasi  it 's something it 's a
skill  parang  like me i 'm still learning  'no
  laughter 
""
""
yeah
""
""
i think there 's uh
""
i don't know about other people but i tend to think there 's a
certain threshold  na  then you can say  na  oh
it 's enjoyable it 's  ganyan 
""
but especially if you 're just starting to do it   
parang  you 're just  groping around
""
""
 yeah she may just  word   
""
""
or just trying to convince yourself that you 're really
enjoying it because   you 're supposed  to enjoy it
""
it 's supposed to be the best thing in the world to do  
but 
""
""
 exactly  
""
 must be the people she goes around with  
""
""
yeah
""
""
i don't know
""
""
she has to prove something
""
""
yeah uh uhm uh-huh  di ba 
""
""
she may pretend that she 's a sex goddess
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
  hello 
""
""
 sex bomb  
""
""
exactly but   actually she 's not 
""
""
  hindi ba  sex bomb   sex bomb
""
""
well we sound like sore losers  laughter 
""
""
no
""
""
no
""
hello
""
that  i will never agree with you
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
it depends on how you see things
""
""
it 's true
""
""
well of course it doesn't necessarily mean that what is right
for me may be right for them
""
""
exactly
""
""
isn't it follows also that
""
""
to each his own
""
""
yeah to each his own
""
correct
""
to each his own
""
""
 bakit bakit  i feel sorry for you because you
haven't you haven't enjoyed uhm
""
""
quote and unquote
""
""
 ano  you haven't tried the joys of sex
""
   ganoon ba 'yon 
""
 'yon ba 'yon 
""
""
 yeah in effect in effect    speaker a laughs
""
""
like i wasn't even advertising the fact that i am because to begin
with why should i
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 word  i had to keep it that way
""
i shouldn't advertise it
""
anyway it was  gene  who started that discussion
""
""
he was another gay friend
""
""
  yeah 
""
""
 uh-huh   uh-huh
""
""
anyway and then there 's another guy like he was telling me
 michael  was saying he was telling me  so you 're going
against the grain 
""
yeah but that 's not difficult you know
""
""
going against the grain   uhm 
""
""
 going against   the grain
""
then i said it 's not difficult with me because there are no
takers
""
i made it look like it 's a joke because there are girls around
who are into it and if i 'm going to say i 'm not like that
""
""
  uh uhm 
""
""
 it 's as if   i 'm condemning those two  
girls 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
so i 'll just make it sound as if it 's a joke and you know
what he said a few minutes after
""
you know i 'm a very kind person
