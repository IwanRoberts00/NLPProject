thank you very much and good afternoon uh how many of you are familiar with n l p already anything that you know about n l p  okay uh spelled out 'no we use n l p to really mean neurolinguistic programming and when we talk about neurolinguistic programming this involves looking into the nervous system okay and when we talk about the nervous system we focus on the five senses that i hope you remember from your grade school years what are the five senses  bakit kayo sa touch nag-uumpisa ha laughter  okay touch okay sight hearing taste and smell 'no  okay the idea here is that we get in touch with the world and we experience the world through the five senses and this is what uh the neuro aspect of n l p refers to so we become aware of the world we become uh familiar with many things about the world and then we respond to the world in terms also of these five senses that we have okay now the linguistic aspect focuses on the fact that we use language whether consciously or unconsciously internally or externally to represent this experience of the world that we have like for instance 'no when you 're feeling warm internally you may be saying ang init naman you know then nagpapaypay ka  or for instance uh a very handsome man passes by 'no you may not really be saying it verbally but internally you might say ang gwapo you know like that so whatever comes in contact with a part of your or with one of your senses gets to be linguistically represented 'no  okay and then the programming aspect means that we really systematize our responses to the various experiences that we have so we systematize 'no we encode and we decode certain uh messages now as we grow then some aspects of responding become patterned that 's why it 's already programmed 'no we are sort of programmed okay now uhm so that 's what basically the three words would mean now simply speaking n l p says really that this may be the world that we really have 'no  okay this is the world that we really have but we may not experience the world as it really is if this is the big world which we might be able to respond to actually we just make representations of the world or we make maps or models of the world 'no  okay uh if you think about a model airplane what comes to your mind huh something what that looks like an airplane from the outside but it 's a small version so it cannot really function the way a real airplane would 'no  it cannot fly or perhaps if it flies only within certain parameters or only within a certain period of time and it may not be able to accommodate passengers just as the real airplane would be able to 'no  so in a way when we make models or maps of the world the models that we make may resemble the real world but may not actually possess all the faculties or the functions of the real world okay now so supposing uh you there are three of you one 's model of the world may be bigger the other one 's may be smaller and the third person 's model may be even smaller now the smaller the model of our world is then the less it approximates or the less it resembles the real world you 'll notice that 'no  a globe is a model of the world  hindi ba 'yung globe has all the countries of the world and the the shapes and all that but the smaller the globe is 'no the less countries it can contain 'no  maybe the philippines might not even be found in that small model or the small globe so that is it 'no  people develop different sizes of the models of the world the problem is some people 's model of the world may be so small 'no that it really incorporates very little of the big world and the smaller our world model is then the more tamed we can be the more problems we have okay now what makes the world model small or big 'no  maybe we can talk about it being smaller than the actual world model because there are constraints that we experience what are some of the constraints of the uh modeling process 'no  one would be that we have nervous system constraints uh there are neurological constraints like for instance 'no if i ask you right now right now at this point what are you aware of okay  okay can you enumerate what you became aware of  you 're aware that you 're hungry okay what about you what are you what were you aware of when i asked that  having a lecturer in front of you and what about you okay you were aware that you were listening 'no okay so three of them had different areas uh speaker stutters uh where they were aware of or speaker stutters of which they were aware 'no  now uh the thing is there are many things that you could have been aware of at that given moment 'no  like uh some of you might have been aware of this microphone stand or the podium or the box here or the tables there the chair the chair there the lights the sound of the air conditioner the picture over there the people around you you could have been aware of such things because they were in existence during the time that i asked you what are you aware of 'no  but see some of you were focused or uh just one or two items at that given moment 'no  according to the proponents of uh neurolinguistic program gramming bundler 'no and grinder we can be aware only of seven plus two chunks chunks 'no seven plus two chunks of information at any given time so bale a maximum of nine information at any given time 'no  like and we say chunks  like you can say i am aware of this specific person this specific person this specific person you 're saying i am aware of people i am aw that 's a chunk of information i am aware of chairs 'no  i am aware of the sound system rather than different sounds specifically 'no  so at any given time we will only be aware of seven plus two chunks of information therefore our nervous system already limits 'no  what we do not become aware of do not become part of this world model okay now we are also limited by our language 'no uh like some of you may be coming from one region another a few may come from another region and you might have different dialects 'no  let us say somebody is somebody is from iloilo 'no and he 's talking to a tagala 'no okay now this ilonggo had a very very uhm fantastic experience 'no  and as she is describing it in ilonggo she can describe it very very well in very very specific more felt ways but then this tagala says i cannot understand what you are saying you translate it to tagalog and then when she translates it to tagalog mahi nahirapan siya or the meanings of the experience are lost already  parang it doesn't sound so good anymore like for instance 'no when you say in taga let 's say the tagalogs 'no in tagalog you say nalulungkot ako 'no  that 's tagalog 'no  when you say nalulungkot yeah there 's a certain element of sadness and you just feel that something is missing something is lacking 'no  but if a person can say nawiwindang ang puso ko 'no it has it gives you a different feeling  di ba   nalulungkot there 's a certain sense of sadness kasi something is missing something is lacking but nawiwindang means there is something more actively eating you up or devastating you 'no  that 's why when you say i 'm sad rather than i am devastated it has a different meaning now if you cannot use the more accurate terms to graphically describe your experiences your world model may be smaller okay now for instance i ask you what 's another word for snow   ano yelo   ano pa   nieve   ano pa   trinanslate n'yo na sa different languages  o ano pa  okay  tayo 'no we have a hard time really translating some people would say another word for snow is ice  but you make an image of ice and you make an image of snow are they the same  hindi ano   di ba   ganyan  but the eskimos 'no okay the people from alaska they don't want to be called eskimo anymore so the people 'no from the cold cold place 'no have seventy different words for snow so alam nila kung ano 'yung snow 'yung pwedeng paglaruan kung ano 'yung snow na pwede nilang i- expose ang sarili nila puwede ring uh lumabas 'no or go out only for necessities or don't go out at all they know which kind of snow would be harmful by the use of the different terms but we cannot find a synonym for snow because we are not exposed to snow at all okay that is the linguistic uh constraint 'no  and we also have what we call individual constraints in this world uh building 'no  okay why because we are individuals we have unique experiences and we have unique interpretations of the experiences so our individual histories can affect how we will view the world like for instance 'no uh if you have a girl who grew up in a family tha where the father was very loving the mother was very caring 'no and she felt very much loved and you have another girl whose father abandoned them when they were young and whose mother committed suicide or attempted suicide several times 'no  who would have a better outlook about relationships with the opposite sex the first one 'di ba   kasi siya 'yung tingin niya ah maganda ang marriage maganda mag- fall in love you will be happy and all that but the other one may huh i 'm not saying automatically she would 'no but the other one may be very skeptical or very cynical about the permanency of love or the fact that love really exists 'no  so ang tingin nila ang ang world model nila would be different 'no  the other one would say oh being in love is a beautiful thing marriage is a beautiful thing but the other one may say marriage is a dangerous thing 'no  so that becomes part of their world model okay are you clear okay now those are the constraints that i said would affect the size of your world model now there are also what we call uh the universals of the human modeling process for instance i say to you can you complete the sentence a man with a moustache is can you answer that can you complete that sentence a man with a moustache is uhm for you is old is mature-looking uhm is big  okay what about this gentleman   is different okay what about the one beside you a man with a moustache is  just for you don't ask anybody is bad  next masculine is not a woman okay laughter   kanta 'yan ng apo hiking ano uhm  o ano pa ha   good looking okay  scary okay  dirty-looking   old okay you notice that i asked several of you 'no  two people answered old one answered mature looking someone answered uh cute i heard it i overheard it somebody said scary somebody said bad somebody said good looking 'no  okay you have a different kind of response 'no for each person now when you see na therefore 'no depending upon the response that you gave when you see a man with a moustache what is the likely response that you will have or reaction that you will have 'no   pag sinabi mong scary or bad 'no kahit na sino pa siya basta meron siyang bigote matatakot ka or iiwasan mo pag sinabi mong macho lalapitan mo 'no cute lalapitan mo di ba kahit ano pa siya this is what we call a generalization 'no  we are saying okay you 're answering once when a man with a moustache is cute but when you really see men with moustaches are they really cute all of them no di ba  okay are they really all bad  hindi naman 'no  are they really all scary  hindi nama  are they really all macho  hindi naman 'no  so you will notice that there is a really really a difference but the thing is sometimes we have a generalization 'no  we generalize that just because a person has this attribute or an experience occurred then it will have the same outcome 'no  like for instance one generalization that we can have is this kunyari naglalak umaakyat tayo ng hagdanan ano tapos nahulog tayo 'no tapos nabalian tayo okay then what happens every time that you see that staircase what happens  natatakot ka na 'no nag-ge-generalize ka na na komo nahulog ka noon mahuhulog ka na naman hindi ba  and you forgot perhaps the one hundred times before that you climbed up that staircase and you did not fall you only remember that particular time that you fell that 's why every time that you approach that staircase medyo sumasakit ang tiyan mo o kaya ingat ka hawak 'no you really hold on very very tightly 'no  okay so you generalize
