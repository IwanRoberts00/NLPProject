 some words missing ms lising oh loy belated happy birthday yes thank you i 'm sorry did i wake you up no no no i was looking at t v uh okay so nothing i wa i was just passing the time uh all right you don't you don't mind my calling oh i don't mind you calling and i enjoy talking with you  laughs sir did you do you remember dr bautista mention to you about the direct conversation data also for the international corpus of english did she mention that about what uh remember when we had the project on international corpus of english yes uh well part of the uh data that she needs for the project is the direct con distance conversation which is a telephone conversation yes so do you mind if i record our conversation did she no no she told me that uh all right uh i told her i 'll be happy to talk with loy  i was expecting your call but you must have been very busy  uh okay  yeah because i 'm data gathering sir i 'm trying to be uh well i i 'm in one school at seven to ten thirty in the morning and i have one hour or so to get to another school by twelve o clock well by the way what 's what 's the thrust of your of your research well it 's uh psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics in nature uh it 's a look at uh filipino-english bilingual children 's language acquisition and it 's trying to explore whether there is a relationship among their degree of bilingualism uh in relation to how their parents talk to them and metalinguistic ability their ability to control and analyze language  uh  well that 's very interesting yeah so i am not into language planning laughs   words i hope you 're recording this now yes sir i am i just turned on the recorder so yeah  yeah  so uh when do you expect to uh complete uh gathering that sir uh i 'm almost half way through uh the data gathering requires that i individually test twenty-five to thirty children from three different schools uhm all of the schools based on tuition fee that are asked for them to pay are categorized in the middle class section so well there are supposed to be three levels well i think in the words i think there were the ilustrados the rich and then the poor that 's it   so the the middle class appeared actually uh the middle class appeared in the philippines and uh but what i am interested in is uh how the middle class  right   uhm  i remembered you in one of your talks i remember vividly how you mentioned that uh one of the driving force of the creation of the middle class is the requirement for uh putting in place english as a medium of instruction in school do i remember what you said correctly you see words in the middle class especially the uh upper middle class you can divide the upper class again into three uh upper middle lower something like that    and of course it depends upon your criteria that words  uh-huh   yeah   words something like that i consider myself belonging to the middle class not upper but you see uh in other respects i belong to the upper class uh i lecture around the world and so forth like that  uh-uhm   yeah   yeah  uh-uhm so it depends on the criteria  words so for example the middle class in the united states would be different from the middle class in the philippines  words i think should be words  of the country like words a special case their middle class is i think different from our middle class   something like that uh so it is a very interesting study uh  yeah yeah  uhm i 've done i i think i need two more sessions and then i 'm already finished with the last test in the two schools after which uh i i need to spend another three weeks or so in de la salle zobel in alabang and then after that uh perhaps just another couple of weeks to go back to the parents uh who may not have submitted their conversa conversation data yet at that time uh and more or less the data should be complete so i 'm thinking i 'm i 'm thinking about march the latest should be end of march for the data gathering sir what i 'm trying to do at the same time when i 'm not able to gather data is try to already you know uh manage it in a certain way so that uh by the time i 'm finished with all the three schools uh simultaneously i 'm also uh able to do something with the data and not well are you do you have any pre-determined uh grid of  words or classifications of words  uh-uhm uh yeah the the some of the factors some of the variables that can be in the grid are are uh the results of the tests i have uh validated i i tested them with the validated comprehension uh test which uh dr de ocampo from u p diliman made it 's a validated what uh it 's a comprehension test written uh well uh in her case it was uh the the the kids had to write their their answer but for me since my respondents are pre-school students so i individually administered the test and then i took uh i i was the one who who wrote the answers on the paper is that right they are not recorded pardon sir yeah they are not recorded on tape the responses yeah uh in some cases yes in others no so for instance uhm for all the students what i do with them is first i have a very short interview which aims at familiarizing them with me and at the same time uh trying to gather some salient information such as who spends most of the time or who spends time with you at home things like that and what language they use when talking to you and who reads to you at night something like that and then the second part when i 'm done with that very short interview uh it 's a comprehension test in both english and filipino comprehensive what comprehension test uh-huh comprehension test uh-huh and it also it tests for their level of bilingualism in terms of whether they 're able to understand both english and filipino equally well or they 're dominant in one of the two languages yes you see this is it uh this hasn't been studied my suspicion is that in the philippines  especially in the public schools uh you you know the public schools and the private schools well of course there 's uh  words  indeed there are some private schools that somehow they 're not the kind of words   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  private schools right  words  you said that you are going to you are recording them uh i 'm recording after the comprehension test the next test which i give them is called the it 's called an arbitrariness test what it is sir is like uh it tests for their control of the language right so yeah you use control of the language uh you know there 's the term semilingual uh right what i see now in the philippines words  uh-uhm i 'm tired of that words  the way i i look at it where i come from uh words  people around here like that a semilingual is a person who neither has control of the subject matter nor the language  facility uh-uhm  words many teachers now this is why i would like to i i would be happy to words  wherein we would uh study uh the semilingualism that is being uh  deve developed having a semilingual class in the philippines who do not know who can have no control of the subject matter they have no control of the uh many of them don't know first they don't know the language according to and then it 's it 's not that only that they do not know the english language uh you know the words  and therefore the worst thing is because they do not know the language they have no control of the language not only that they they do not know the the content in other words when you are speaking uh when you speak you have some control of both language and content now uh if you don't uh if you have no control of both that is you are weak in both then you are a semilingual  and uh there are so many semilinguals in the philippines now   and many of them teachers  uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm   laughs yeah that 's very unfortunate  some teachers come to my house and then they are very afraid especially my relatives because i speak to them in english and they would shift you know and i say no i want when we talk in english everything must be in english i don't want a mixture and so they are very nervous  yeah   uh-uhm   uh-uhm   laughs  that 's why they avoid my they avoid me they don't come to my house uh these are relatives the relatives of my wife and my relatives of course i 'm harsh on them but uh you know in the schools this is just guesswork now this is i have no data but uh based on certain uh well words teachers to professionals they give examinations to professionals boards something like that for teachers  now i have a booklet here and i don't know where i got it but anyway i think a friend of mine or something uh anyway uh many of them do not know have no control of both languages i say languages because they have no control of the of say filipino and they have no control of english then they do not have control of the subject matter they don't words so laughs  words  and then many of these people become teachers so it 's good you know uh of course the lawyer the lawyer 's mistake goes behind bars uh the doctor 's mistake gets buried underground  yeah   right   laughs and the teacher 's mistake gets multiplied and the teacher 's mistake goes on spreading the rot  laughs  so i mean this is tragic  and the worst thing is uh words or a lawyer or a doctor i am conceited to think that i have the brains for any of the three uh and but my father said look it is also economic now you are the eldest you are the oldest among six children we are very poor my father was municipal treasurer long ago and uh he said uh i want you as the oldest to help that is your duty so i want you to take up normal to take up teaching uh and you can easily be a teacher if you graduate well the interviews were done mostly by americans and so uh because of poverty and not of my choice i became a teacher i became a teacher uh well of course i was in the news the other day whether this is good or not because well the you know uh james joyce 's ulysses  the stream of consciousness the novel that started the genre of stream of consciousness continued by thomas wolfe in look homeward angel and uh uh you can't go incomplete title have you read those novels  yeah   work uh-uhm uh i think the first one i did i did that when i was doing my literature in australia  look homeward angel  yeah well then well you see i have two masters degrees one is in psychology and the other is in english literature uh-huh okay so there was once upon a time i thought i 'd be a great writer but uh i got over that something like that now if you are recording this conversation it would be very interesting to be played back  laughs i can bring it tomorrow i 'll be there tomorrow for your uh the dr vilches' professorial lecture you 're gonna be in la salle tomorrow right yes i 'll be there good i will as usual i will deliver the uh sometimes they are long i tend to talk and talk and talk and talk and there is no  words  we don't mind for one the affair is done in honor of you so you can talk as much as you like and i think people are fascinated when you talk because you are very funny  laughs i don't know well but you see i cannot make it too long because the food is waiting and some some of the people who are listening look back at the table where the food is well anyway so i 'll see you tomorrow yes sir i 'll be there yeah but you know you mentioned about being interested in finding out whether how semilingual especially teachers are you know you 'd be interested if i 'm able to manage the data uh later you 'd be interested to find out that what the results would be because apparently uh what i 'm doing in the study is to see how one of the parents of the child talk to the child and and the child how the child talks back to the parent so i 'm recording that uh and i 'm doing that to find out whether the parent would be talking mostly in english or in filipino or code-switching in those languages are these structured or are they uh what 's the opposite of  structured  are the interviews that you are recording structured uh well it 's not it 's not arbitrarily done what happens is that i have created uh an album of pictures that don't have any text uh so there is a structure yeah it 's it 's structured and controlled in that sense but at the same time uh what i 've done is well for one the pictures have to meet certain criteria such as they they they shouldn't be culture-bound the items they would see in the picture yeah yeah and that the pictures are easily accessible in both english and filipino so i i was able to come up with those pictures  yeah  are they photographs or drawings uh no uh you know i ended up i ended up borrowing my daughter 's bedtime storybooks and i was able to find there items that are easily accessible in english and filipino and then i just scanned and printed them out   and yeah then when i spoke with the parents i either met with them i 'm meeting some of them uh or i call them over the phone i just explain to them that i 'm just interested in the way they talk to their children so no specific uh bidding in terms of saying whether it 's english or filipino uhm so it 's yeah  yeah  uh i see
