""
""
thank you very much
""
you know the topic that uh i was given to lecture on is something that uh has been very intriguing to a lot of people because we tend to found uh institutions
""
some of us have founded institutions and so did john baptist de la salle
""
but i think there is a difference between what he did and what others do
""
and i think the basic difference lies in the acts of the apostles when gamaliel was quoted to have said when the new group called christians were uhm influencing the lives of a lot of people and the enemies of christianity were trying to to kill the movement
""
and gamaliel said  if this is the work of god it will stand if it is not it will founder 
""
and i think that 's very significant because the key sentence there is  if it is the work of god 
""
if it is the work of man it will probably be seen as the work of man
""
 so we 're saying uh founder  siya  
""
but if it is the work of god it is god that is glorified
""
and it is in that context that i have uh looked at this topic that i will share with you this afternoon
""
and i 'm also looking at the very specific areas of the founder and i call these  his trials and tribulations 
""
because some of us suffer because of our own doing
""
others suffer because of god 
""
and my sub-sub-topic is the stresses that john baptist de la salle had to go through
""
there have been many things said about the founder and those of you who have been following the  signum fidei  lecture series  eve  and even further back like the presentations of brother miguel campos can already be considered quite conversant with the life of this great but humble man
""
he is the source of our inspiration and his life is worthy of emulation
""
it is quite certain that he was of good breeding since both his parents belonged to the noble class and to the aristocracy although brother luke salm claims the family belonged to the upper wealthy  bourgeoisie  class
""
we can surmise then he was brought up according to the demands of his class and was considered well-bred
""
a well-bred person does not easily succumb to complaining or to whining is usually reserved is not loud and does not go for grandiosity
""
today we might describe such a person as one possessing a quiet competent quality
""
we can further surmise that john was not used to suffering nor to deprivation nor to scandal
""
when john took on the responsibility of the christian schools and the training of the teachers he did not have any inkling at all of the consequences of his decision
""
as he had said one thing led to another and providence had many surprises pleasant and unpleasant in store for him
""
i would like to dwell then on an area which i consider a necessary component when one accepts the friendship of jesus
""
it is a common complaint among those who are close to jesus that he is a difficult pill to swallow
""
jesus exacts a lot from his followers and a lot more from his close friends
""
saint teresa of avila in a moment of exasperation and great  suffer  suffering was reported to have uttered if this is the way you treat your friends she was referring to jesus she said no wonder you have so few of them
""
i have gone over the several bibliographies of the founder and i found the work is yours the life of saint john baptist de la salle which is by brother luke salm to be the most appropriate for this lecture
""
the trials and tribulations of the founder are manifested in critical incidents of his life and deal with practically every aspect of his work his relationship with his family with his peers with his teachers with the local church the local clergy with the bishops and with his own brothers and community
""
i shall deal with each of these aspects and give examples of the difficulties that were encountered by john
""
his health and he was also accident-prone de la salle 's health was to a large extent good
""
there are no evidence in any extant document that would indicate otherwise
""
however due to accidents and severe living conditions he suffered much from injuries previously sustained and from prolonged exposure to the elements
""
in one trip coming back from the country de la salle came close to losing his life
""
he was caught in a blinding snowstorm and fell into a ditch
""
the more he struggled to free himself the deeper he sank into the mire
""
close to exhaustion and about to lose consciousness he made one desperate  he made one desperate effort and was finally able to free himself
""
as a result of this experience he suffered a rupture and this rupture would recur from time to time with great pain
""
when it recurred though it was an opportunity for de la salle instead of complaining to thank the lord for saving his life
""
another example was when he crossed the tuileries garden in paris he stumbled and fell
""
his knee which had already been cut open to drain an inflamed swelling was pierced through by a concealed spike in the gateway
""
he fainted on the spot
""
according to the account the bystanders at first thought he was drunk and ignored him
""
and it was with tremendous effort that de la salle was able to reach the door of a community house and fell unconscious in the arms of a brother who opened the door
""
he was prone to attacks of rheumatism which at times were so acute and so painful that he thought he might die
""
the prevalent remedy was as painful as the disease
""
the remedy was  one would be stretched over a grill beneath which were medicinal herbs steaming over burning coals
""
there was even an incident which if not for the serious consequence would have been very funny
""
a young brother trying to be helpful pulled back a chair as de la salle was about to sit down
""
the founder lost his balance and fell on his face
""
this opened a gash in his head and later caused pain in his ear
""
he even remarked as he was suffering one headache after another that he felt as if his head were split in two
""
another area where where the founder suffered was the area of deceit and i call this  estafa 
""
de la salle suffered through a number of court cases that dealt with  estafa 
""
in one instance he agreed to form a partnership with a young man named clement who was going to provide the building for his school
""
he his work was expanding and so he tried to to look for somebody who might join him in putting up a building
""
and he was one man who said okay i will help you
""
this young man clement was going to inherit a large amount of money and property but since he was not yet twenty-five years old which is the legal age in france at that time for this kind of transaction it was his lawyer who negotiated with de la salle regarding this particular property
""
de la salle advanced the money of over five thousand   livre   which was quite considerable at that time
""
so he advanced it
""
when clement came into money and into age he reneged reimbursing the founder and to add insult to injury he insisted that the house was his
""
because clement had influential contacts both in the church and in the government he sued and de la salle was cited to appear in court to answer to charges of suborning a minor for the purpose of extorting money from him
""
de la salle remember was the victim and he was the one sued
""
he also had conflicts with pastors and bishops  again not of his own doing
""
de la salle himself a member of the clergy always showed deference to pastors and to members of the hierarchy
""
however this was taken for weakness and he was abused by some of these men who did not return the respect the founder had for them
""
the matter of the habit was a source of difficulty with father baudrand
""
habit meaning the brothers had a peculiar habit because de la salle wanted the brothers to look very different from the clergy at that time
""
well this father baudrand did not like the habit that was designed by de la salle for his brothers
""
he thought it was too  probinsyano  and he wanted the brothers to dress a little bit more fashionable
""
and de la salle insisted that the habit spelled the identity of the brothers and no change should be allowed
""
besides it was not the intention of de la salle to be a diocesan congregation and insisted on the autonomy of the community
""
the consequence of this was that he made a number of enemies and some brothers even left him siding with the pastors
""
the pastor that had a long struggle with de la salle was father de la chetardie who thought that the founder was no longer fit to be a superior
""
he wrote a long memorandum to a cardinal named noailles describing dissension among the brothers and that many were disillusioned with their vocation
""
in other words father de la chetardie concocted stories to  make sure that in the eyes of the hierarchy the cardinal and the bishops that de la salle was no longer worthy to be the head of the congregation that he founded 
""
another group that did not like de la salle was a group called the writing masters
""
the writing masters were the prevailing teachers at that time
""
they were basically teaching writing to a lot of the richer uh members of the community
""
and when de la salle established his schools a number of the students of the writing masters asked to be admitted to the schools of de la salle
""
not only were they better but they were free
""
and because of the success of the christian schools as they were called then and because of the many of the pupils of the writing masters were transferring  en masse  to the brothers de la salle was once again the focus of attack from this group
""
in one incident as a result of the influence of the writing masters with the police two officers of the court accompanied by a sergeant-at-arms appeared at the school on february seven seventeen oh four took an inventory of all the school furnishings desks chairs pens ink wells and put them under seal for safekeeping pending the judgment of the court
""
they were eventually confiscated
""
group of men just entered the classroom and the school building and took everything that was not nailed
""
in another instance sensing the rift between de la salle and the pastors the writing masters aligned themselves with father de la chetardie and together they were able to get an edict from the diocesan chancery forbidding de la salle to teach to engage or assign other teachers in paris without the express permission of the diocesan supervisor of schools who was also not very sympathetic to de la salle and his group
""
at the time when this happened the diocesan supervisor was father de la chetardie
""
he had problems with his own family
""
de la salle was barely twenty-one when his father and mother died just months apart
""
being the eldest he had to assume the responsibility to manage his  parents'  holdings and to take care of his four brothers and two sisters
""
he was also at that time studying towards the priesthood
""
although it entered his mind that god might have been giving a sign of another vocation he continued on with his seminary and academic training although he would not have been faulted if he took these events as signs from god that he was not meant to be a priest
""
can you imagine today if any young man was studying at the seminary or studying to be a brother and both his parents die and he becomes the manager of a vast holdings would you think that he would continue to study for the priesthood or he would continue to stay in the novitiate
 a practical mind would say god is telling me that this priesthood this vocation to the religious life is not mine
 in the case of john baptist de la salle he pursued his vocation
 in cases like this when there was a dilemma and he was not sure what god wanted him wanted of him de la salle undertook counsel from close friends known for holiness and deep spirituality
