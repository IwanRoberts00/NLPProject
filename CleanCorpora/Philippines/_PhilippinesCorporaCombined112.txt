yes chapter eleven we should start with chapter eleven we start with chapter eleven chapter eleven you if you remember when we took up chapter nine we left out the last part of the discussion which was on bureaucracy you remember okay we did not discuss bureaucracy because bureaucracy is a topic that is to be covered with the other institutions now after chapter nine we took up chapter ten which is on family and family is not a bureaucracy okay so before we go to the study of chapter eleven on religion let us go back to chapter nine that aspect on bureaucracy and take a look at what that is so that we can by the way because somebody 's taping the session you don't have a quiz  yehey   teacher addresses the one taping the session  you wanted me to conduct the lecture rather than have uh sige  okay  yehey  but you have to talk louder so your your voice can get recorded students make noise  okay so uh what we are going to take up before discussing religion is the subject of bureaucracy mitch do you want to start uh o ako pala ano teka muna  i 'll have to discuss it so what do we mean by bureaucracy  what do we mean by bureaucracy  don't you have anything to say about bureaucracy  what what do you know about bureaucracy  anna a hierarchy of of jobs or tasks now from your understanding from your familiarity with the term what does bureaucracy in a sense uh uh make you think of  red tape   red tape okay what else checks and balances  red tape  just what is red tape  when it is when one person goes to another to an official and then words  one person goes to an official a person who needs something let 's say in an organization he 's asked to go to an official and then he 's asked to go to a higher official and it goes on and on and words  uh-huh any other idea edwin  red tape   words the long process of a person trying to ask a favor from an institution a long process involving request for favor from an institution what about it when does it become red tape  does just having a long process uh make it red tape  analie i think red tape is a kind of hindrance that uh-huh makes uh a process which is supposed to be this this short yes uh-huh   long  okay so the idea is there what else can we say about bureaucracy  from your own familiarity with the term you don't you 've met the word bureaucracy okay so that brings to mind uh implies red tape  another wilson uhm bureaucracy is a system uh if an in an organization which is supposed to make a process more efficient but in many cases it makes it even more inefficient  bureaucracy you say is a system okay what is in that system ramon system of checks and balances well let 's say uh you 're talking about the system here presence of procedures you 're referring to the existence of rules regulations uhm what else let 's take a look at what bureaucracy is really it is defined as what it refers to students answer in chorus but answer is inaudible okay it talks about a particular system but that system refers to a hierarchy of what a hierarchy of positions in a large usually when we talk about large organizations this is a secondary group setting 'no  a large organization which makes possible  what  the performance uh the performance of certain tasks okay which makes it possible for the institution or the organization to perform its tasks and functions okay so look it refers to that hierarchy and by hierarchy you 're thinking about what what comes to mind what does the word brings to mind students answer  pyramidal that means what does it always have to be pyramidal it brings to mind layers it brings to mind what  students answer in chorus levels  levels more appropriately ranking di ba   may mataas may mababa  so ranking there are people at the top and people at the bottom excuse me we have to end this break in the recording  what transpired before you because we will use that to discuss when we talk about politics and education okay so let 's go back to what we were discussing uhm when you when you talk about bureaucracy you 're actually referring to what a hierarchy of positions in a large secondary organization which makes sure that the tasks and function of that organization are accomplished okay now when you talk about hierarchy you imply ranking there are people at the top all the way down to the bottom and all these people are necessary to make this organization run or function now uh that is why uh i suppose it will be very easy for you now to connect the existence of a hierarchy the presence of what different kinds of people running the organization and the necessity for procedures rules and regulations to make the entire organization run smoothly as a result of this need the presence of the hierarchy uh to ensure that the organization runs smoothly you may encounter certain problems that 's why one of the problems you have encountered is what we call red tape  isn't that uh uh a fact that if you have a large the larger the organization what have you learned the larger the organization the  students answer in chorus more complex  of course the more complex the more important it is to make sure that each member of that organization knows what he or she is supposed to do isn't that right okay so therefore you must have what systems systems you must install systems so that this organization will be able to operate smoothly efficiently effectively if it 's an organization that is uh what whose goal is to deliver services  the services have to be  what is the test of the performance of the organization the what the results or the act   performance that services are actually delivered to communities that it 's supposed to serve how do you do that if you do not ensure a smooth flow of operations so they would like to be efficient they would like to be effective so you they set up what systems systems of procedures okay systems involving procedures involving rules how to how to now when they do that what happens is i it 's really for this purpose the objectives are noble di ba  they want to deliver in that that example that we presented let 's say the what i mean ano a department a government uh uh agency department of transportation for example or a department for social services 'no  so what happens is they want to deliver they want to perform well so they want to deliver what they 're supposed to deliver now uhm in the interest of performing well what happens is they become fle uhm inflexible you have set up systems and procedures right now people follow that to the letter so what happens is you have inflexibility okay and what happens is because this is a large organization with a lot of people with a lot of functions what happens is the procedures become long-winded right that 's why you are referring to red tape   parang matagal bago magawa ang isang bagay  take a look at something you are following up uh what we call paper-chase in government not only government educational systems all of the other institutions from religion so you have next education the economy and the political institutions all of these are what  large organizations or involves excuse me all of them involve large organizations which tend to become if they are not already what bureaucracies okay so all of them would have problems like this problems of wanting to perform well and as a result encountering other problems like inflexibility so they 're so inflexible such that what do we what do we see in in in the case of processing papers if the a certain person it 's like if this is your pi piece of paper and the routes for this paper is from person a to b to c to d before it goes out again to you  di ba okay so paper in paper out  what are the stages or the routes that are taken by this paper a person a b c d what happens what happens in actual situation these these are only four people usual or these these might be four persons or four offices or four units or four departments okay now what happens if there are departments to go to it would be more awful because there are people in the departments who take charge of that there are two or three persons in a department in a unit uh who have to take charge of that what is going to happen to the process it will be lengthier longer right  kaya sinasabi natin red tape di ba okay now what happens when when this piece of paper goes to a and if let us say a is not there  the whole system is held up okay the whole the processing is held up or delayed so you have to wait for a and sometimes the inflexibility can be carried to such an extent that nobody else takes the place of a so if a is on vacation for two weeks you 'll have to return maybe two weeks uh you 'll have to give two weeks more to the processing if it will take a matter of one week for paper in to paper out  what happens a will have to be out for two weeks and the the paper cannot move from a to b because a is absent so you 'll have to be to add one week of processing plus two weeks of absence by a so you have to have three weeks so it 's longer it takes longer now why does this happen because you have what very clear-cut procedures only a can sign something like that what is that for perhaps it is to meet another objective of the organization which is to make sure that things are done in proper  order order proper systems so you have a system of check and balance  hindi puwede na hindi dumaan dito for some kind of what approval sanction okay so you have uh a very long-winded process resulting from this particular instance so we talk about what in the bureaucracy you have red tapes in the bureaucracy the bureaucracy becomes so inflexible okay if the person is not there nobody else can take his place so the system gets derailed or gets delayed is held up okay now isn't that what we experienced take a look why why do we say that this is true even in religion take a look at our catholic church which is one big what  bureaucracy yes bureaucracy organization in the religious institution there are many others i suppose every other church organization would qualify as a bureaucracy the iglesia ni kristo is another big bureaucracy the different protestant churches would be bureaucracies in their own right 'no  so take a look at positions even what did i say the other time did i mention this about even in the in the heavens you have a hierarchy from the archangel down to the cherubs the cherubims 'no  with the head and then the word like that okay with the wings and then take a look at the catholic church from the pope down to the bishops archbishops all of them the priests down to the laity okay right so now take a look at educational institutions de la salle university isn't the situation the same you have what the president okay   vi executive vice-president  all the different vice pres all the positions and down to what the teachers the faculty down to the other personnel of the university down to your security guard all of them occupying what different ranks different positions that is uh that 's supposed to guarantee that this organization is going to flow is going to run smoothly so have haven't you tried uh to sample some red tapes during let 's say what what times  enrolment registration students give reactions  okay now we move from educational system to what  government government political organizations so you want to apply for a driver 's license at the l t o okay now that 's why you see what i am i would not want to rationalize i would never want to rationalize graft and corruption or bribery
