e dapat  quality appliances like national yes uhm for the pilaf we have actually placed here two cups of soaked  dinorado rice and then we are adding this spaghetti sauce prego yes and three and a half cups water actually when we do two dishes at the same time we saw it best to put more water kasi double double time yung ginagawang trabaho nung liquid so that we are going to steam something else on top okay and then we put this fresh garlic for our tomato pilaf and our beef cubes also to heighten the taste okay yun lang po isasalang na natin itong pan hmmh we turn it on by pushing this button down and naka-  ready na rin ang ating custard steamer so lahat ng egg dito sylvia  nandito itong century egg we just put it here uh-uh and then we put the salted egg yung yolk  nya spread it around lang  and then lalagyan din natin siya ng ground pork  mga one hundred grams lang isang guhit lang po  pero this will be a very high protein dish yes and then this is five eggs na atin nang ini-  scramble then that 's it  i- spread lang natin para ma-  cover siya then we 're ready to cover it with our foil  para siyang leche flan   tita sylvia two-layer din yung foil  para hindi

our televiewers 'no  i just would like to share that tita sylvia really values time  kami rin po sa national we value especially yung mga working mothers out there 'no we know that it 's really important for them na mag-  to manage their time as a wife as a mother and of course as a professional and that 's also the reason why national  always comes up with kitchen appliances that brings convenience to the homemakers okay so to give you a sample okay today we will prepare aromatic rice using our uh world series rice cooker and spicy tomato beef using our national gas stove we 'll be needing two cups of both plain rice and milagrosa  rice tita yung mabango po yes okay then we 'll be needing seven cups water okay  dito po ihahalo nyo lang ulit lahat ng ingredients  natin ano  then we 'll add in two tablespoon of both garlic flakes at saka yung ating nutmeg crushed powder okay you can buy this in the groceries 'no  then we add in one-fourth teaspoon uh turmeric powder ito po yung to add color and of course yung scent  po ng aroma and of course you just put in bell pepper uh sorry the pepper and of course we 'll be putting in lemon grass mga  two stalks will do  tapos we 'll add in three hundred grams ng  uh chicken breast fillet strips na po yan okay then we just mix it then cover and put it in our rice cooker now tita i was mentioning about world series  now i just would like to share that this rice cooker is being exported not just in the philippines but now as well in fifteen different countries all over the world including japan and u s a okay so we just put this down for rice cooking now if you notice po uh we have a glass cover because this model comes with a top pipe steamer so you can actually steam your ulam siopao or anything while cooking your rice  ayon  so iwan po muna natin ito so we 'll cook this for about thirty minutes then let it simmer for fifteen minutes then it 's done so i was mentioning with power flame burner  yes so dito nyo po makikita yung concentrated cone-shaped flame that it emits 'no through the power flame burner thirty percent savings because of the heat of time that it cuts let 's say if you boil water in seven minutes through this five minutes na lang  so let 's put in our oil okay then let 's stir-fry the garlic okay naririnig mo na po tita mainit-init na 'to 'no so sandaling-sandali lang po  tapos the ginger then we add in three hundred grams of tenderloin cubes na po   tita di ba you always mention that it 's important  na let 's not overcook the meat ano  we put now in two teaspoon of white uh sorry one-half teaspoon of white pepper and the dried chili mas maanghang mas masarap  so let 's put in water tita one hundred m l water and okay let 's add in our tomato okay salt  halo lang po tayo ulit ano  then we add in about two tablespoon tomato paste okay so we 'll just let it simmer for a minute or a minute-and-a-half  tapos we 'll add in our uh one-fourth bar of melt cheese to make it more creamier okay of course after cooking na na nandyan yung  hassle of cleaning so if you see our g p two one one m a s model it already comes with non-stick coating so just use a wet cloth ano  now all the assemblies is also detachable the detachable trivet of course the burner itself is also detachable yes it 's brass yes and also the burner valve is also detachable also very important is the three hundred sixty degrees rotatable inlet pipe that we always mention ano so you don't have to worry where to place your gas tank lalo na pag masikip ang  kitchen  di ba yun po ang nagiging cause palagi ng  leak sa ating gas yon  so we 'll just leave that for two minutes and then it 's done uh yes we put in raisins tita and of course the frozen mixed vegetables pag luto na ito- toss lang natin yan  hello everyone uh i really missed our audience and i really am glad that i 'm back here in your kitchen sylvia and uh for today we 're going to do some uh very authentic uh dish  na yung bang mga turo ng mga lola natin  we will be using uh monterey pata pata sliced  makita mo ang ganda di ba and it looks so clean and uh talagang makita nyo very very lean okay so you know when you buy pata in the meat shop you can specify whether you want it whole for pata tim  or for this particular uh dish if you want it cut up  kasi it 's kind of hard to chop pata  at home because of the bone chips so it 's pre pre-sliced already  dahil meron silang meat saw yeah but you know so we 'll put the vinegar just dump this all together brown sugar garlic wala in any ano in any order  pwede yan   tapos toyo black beans tausi oo tausi and let 's put some chopped peppercorns and some bay leaf okay and of course water para we will boil the  pata in this now if you 're in a hurry there 's no problem you can use a pressure cooker okay lang yun  this takes about an hour or an hour and a half kasi masarap nito yung medyo gelatinous na  so we just put this in the pan all together and then just close this and uh cook it over boiling then simmering until it 's tender so lutuin natin close it para  the heat will be even all throughout and uh also we can put the banana blossom o yung tawag natin usbong ng saging  it gives a sweetish taste  alam mo sylvs sa amerika hit  na hit talaga ang asian dishes yes so here 's our finished product  gusto ko 'to kasi manamis-namis na maalat-alat  see wow look at
