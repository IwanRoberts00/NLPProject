just leave it here talks to speaker z about cassette-recorder  so anyway like i was saying right  lakasan nyo na lang ang boses nyo  what was i saying  ayun nga so parang i said i don't care  says to speaker z you can go now coughs  what was i saying i mean uhm uh so i told james right  that tha what trish told me  that  trish is like please tell james i don't care if it means having to stop seeing him but her point is that she is just tired already trish is like if you care about me the way you say you are then show it right and then so james he feel he feels bad james is like he 's sitting there and he said i 'm really sorry and he hugged me you know he goes you know i understand now what your sister is saying and then he goes i 'm sorry i took you for granted you know you had you didn't deserve to feel that way i 'm really sorry at least james understands that right and then after but he said like little by little that 's when he 's gonna let it out so that night with the whole gang there right uh trish was like they better not play that song and then they did right they played the song uhm what song was that  words and that 's part of the c d that uh that james gave james bought trish right so trish looks at him it was so funny 'cause trish looks at him with this look on her face oh my god that 's our song right and james looks at her like don't come any closer or i 'm gonna you know lean over and lay one on you so james james goes i 'm about to give in i really am i said and then trish goes uhm are you sure i mean everyone 's here and then james says i don't care anymore i don't care who knows in fact i want the whole world to know of course that meant a lot to trish word  are you serious so that everyone started dancing right and that both that singer guy goes over to trish and gets her hand right and she goes on playing but then that guy calls her up later on and says hey i saw you and james uh you were pretty sweet trish is like uh so so we are right and then yeah he was i i guess well james keeps saying that that guy likes trish but trish doesn't care because trish is in love with james  words  and for the first time you know trish found someone who when when she looks at him everyone else falls into words  it 's just him i mean not that she disregards everyone they 're there but it 's just him he 's all that is important and she doesn't care if her ex-boyfriend passes by or his ex-girlfriend passes by all that matters is that they 're together in the same area trish is a lot prettier than his ex-girlfriend  laughs well i 'm sure trish would like that would like to hear that yeah but for a while trish felt it she was like you know  words  was she the reason why they broke up i don't think so i hope not i hope not i 'd hate for trish to be a home-wrecker i mean you know it 's bad enough what trish went through in the first relationship with you know all that yeah i remember that  laughs and yeah and oh yeah uhm james was saying something like oh there 's something about what you said that i was uhm trish 's uhm uhm ex-relationships right james james was just telling her it 's all in the family you know family and it was fun because they were trying to be they would see her that they 're together and trish even said you know james i 'm sorry about the break-up but i 'm even sorrier because i 'm not really sorry get it trish is like i feel bad that you guys broke up but i don't feel that bad oh but i feel worse that i 'm not sincere i mean in fact i 'm happy   it only shows she doesn't love him that much yeah but i was happy that you know said trish yeah trish was saying that i was happy that you broke up i guess not that she wanted james to be hurt it 's because i don't know i guess she felt that she wanted to give james something more words  words and trish calls her trish never calls his ex-girlfriend by her full name by her full name trish always calls her would-be ex-girlfriend  like trish word she said that you know you and your ex-girlfriend because if if trish calls her by her real name it would sound like they knew each other right but that 's words  we they were introduced uh we were all in here and then they were introduced in fact james goes oh yeah you know this is my sweetie and then you know sweetie this is trish so it was kind of weird you know because the next i think a couple of weeks after that they broke up uh-uhm and then a week later on or a couple of weeks later on she 's walking down the street sees his car knocks on a window she he puts he rolls the window down and she looks in and trish and james were in the car right so she looked she gave trish this mean like bad trish didn't know what to do she was sitting there oh my god  james she shouldn't have seen me i shouldn't have been here and james is like i don't care you know screw that she you know she left me she 's got her own reasons why can't i go out on my own but i guess for a while james was struggling to make trish feel like she 's the most important person in his life he kept calling her up i guess sometimes words because like yesterday trish and james were somewhere there right after uhm james word  and then james 's ex-girlfriend happened to be there oh the other one the older one yeah the older yeah yeah that girl that bitch  that girl yeah that b s right so i was sitting by the lobby you know where the photocopying machine is and she was there and i said hey what 's up you know that 's true words   laughs i think so i mean not to words  about but you know when i see that girl she 's like a like a like a prostitute or a dead person yeah she 's so white i mean she used to stare at me in a mean way every time i 'm near her she did it to trish too all of her words  when she comes in  laughs holy cow so you know uhm trish walked over sat down and then the girl shelly goes hey hi you know trish was like hey hi and then shelly 's like oh that 's a nice jacket and trish was like thanks but it 's not mine whose jacket is that james oh and she has a look like oh okay shelly 's like so uhm are you tired why don't you go home yeah i will in a while i 'm just waiting and then she asks like what are you waiting for right and she was like when james is finished oh okay and then for a minute there i think shelly gets it then she looks then she goes so what 's up with you i mean trish and shelly would never boast correct yeah yeah right in fact when they came to the station you know shelly was like hi hi hi d hi but then in the hallway they wouldn't look at each other not yeah so you know it 's not fishy and then uhm she goes so what 's up with you i mean do you have a boyfriend then trish is like what no i broke up with him a long time ago it is a long time ago i mean you know if you think about it pretty much yeah i mean emotionally it 's not like a long time ago and then shelly goes oh so are you going out with anyone but then james told her already before a couple of weeks after i don't care if she finds out that we 're dating in fact james told his best friend that you know that they were dating and i you know like trish is just oh my gosh she was telling me right she 's like i 'm the happiest girl alive because i mean how would you feel when your guy tells his best friend that he 's finally dating that 's a sweet thing when it comes from a guy right so when i heard about it i was happy for her too but oh my god that 's that 's exciting and and he he he 's got the same birthday as trish  same day yeah really yeah it 's so weird i know it 's so weird right and then yeah so there and i was thrilled when i heard about it i was words and james sounded so excited he sounded like a little boy who 's just got a star in class like you know what i told my best friend we were dating and trish was like oh my god that is really sweet and then uhm to think that they 're going out on a week-end i think uhm trish uhm james their
