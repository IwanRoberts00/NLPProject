""
thank you mr chairman
""
mr chairman uhm may i make comments with respect to ballot boxes from
singapore brazil new zealand and italy and more particularly with respect to
malaysia and czech republic  comments
""
the uh number in words for the votes of candidate gloria
macapagal-arroyo was erased replaced with uh new handwriting because all of
these contained in the carbon copies are in words
""
likewise the votes for candidate loren legarda the number that is was
likewise erased replaced with the uhm the numbers five hundred twenty-one
""
uh mr chairman i would like to place on record that this is a clear
case of an erasure in the c o c
""
in fact after it was made because obviously the ink in the c o c
copies that is colored blue because it is merely a carbon copy of the first c
o c in which the uhm board of canvassers canvassers wrote on however the
correction was made individually for each  words  the
names in black
""
may i also make of record mr chairman that unlike the c o c contained
in ballot box number twenty-one wherein the alteration or erasure was
initialed the  altera  the erasure and alteration found in the c o c
for malaysia was not initialed by anyone
""
 as a third point mr chairman as a final point uhm  long clause
in tagalog 
""
uhm at the risk of stating it again  long clause in tagalog 
""
""
and having said that mr chairman may i pose a manifestation at the
same time inquiry
""
 for the record  clause in tagalog  senator biazon member
of this twenty-two-man committee  long clause in tagalog  
""
now since this matter has been raised on several occasions by the
lawyers mr chairman uhm senator biazon is not here right now uhm at a proper
time may we know from senator biazon what that information is because it
might be relevant  sa  canvassing being conducted by this
""
now on a personal point at this juncture mr chairman again as i said
it is only for the record at a proper time may we get a response or reply or
clarification from the  words 
""
thank you 
""
""
""
thank you mr chairman
""
several points mr chairman if i will be given the leeway insofar as
 word 
""
first of all for the record according to the face of the c o c the
votes obtained by f p j is twenty-four thousand five hundred seventy-four
""
the votes obtained by g m a was twenty-one thousand one hundred
eighty-five
""
in other words  clause in tagalog  and having said that allow
me to make my observations mr chairman and the reason why i am making this
position
""
 long statement in tagalog 
""
now several times the word  disenfranchisement 
has been used whenever there is a motion from either the counsel or a member
of this committee to set aside a particular c o c
""
mr chairman distinguished members of this committee i think the
proper term is  defer 
""
 clause in tagalog 
""
no one is being disenfranchised in fact we are protecting the right
of every voter by ensuring that in the votes they cast in the last elections
will be the ones that will be counted
""
next point mr chairman
""
during the deliberations on the rules senator pangilinan the sponsor
of the rules said and you can check the records on this matter that the s o v
is one of the documents against which we can prove the authenticity and due
execution of a particular c o c because it will reveal whether or not the
votes stated therein would tally with respect to the tally contained in the c
o c
""
uhm thirdly after the rules were adopted and approved this
representation mr chairman sought permission from the senate president
precisely to point out one fact
""
 long clause in tagalog 
""
at that point mr chairman this representation stood up and asked the
chair  clause in tagalog 
""
even at that early stage that was thursday last week we made the
necessary representations  words  the record whose records
they have in their custody the s o v by precinct  clause in tagalog 
""
i do not know mr chairman uhm if not stopped by the house either in
joint session or by the joint committee
""
again mr chairman we do not seek to delay or further delay this
proceeding
""
in fact that suggestion was made a week ago precisely to avoid this
situation
""
now later on after some other comments have been made probably a
motion will be made to produce the s o v prior to canvassing this particular
c o c
""
 two sentences in tagalog 
""
and mr chairman uhm if i may finally state  authenticity
 pertains to signatures thumbmarks paper serial number fibers but
 due execution  means that all of the  words
 for every single c o c were filled up in accordance with law
""
and the law simply states that  clause in tagalog 
""
and the only way to find that out is at the very least  clause in
tagalog  by precinct for this particular c o c for this particular
province
""
again mr chairman to reiterate section seventeen of our very own
rules state that we should look for erasures or alterations in either the c o
c or the s o v by precinct
""
how can we find out if there are erasures or alterations in the s o v
by precinct if we cannot even look at it or see it here before us
""
may i reserve my right mr chairman the proper time to seek redress
insofar as the production of the s o vs
""
thank you 
""
""
""
thank you mr chairman
""
uhm according to congressman abad there is no need for section
seventeen to come into operation because there seems to be no erasure or
alteration in the c o c
""
however section seventeen is clear  if there is no alteration
in the c o c or statement of votes by precinct 
""
now i agree with congressman abad
""
indeed there is no alteration or erasure in the statement of votes by
precinct because we did not even see it
""
how can i even know if indeed there is an alteration or erasure in
the s o v by precinct if we could not even get a good chance to see it
""
 clause in tagalog  alteration and erasure in s o v by
precinct
""
however mr chairman having said that may i reiterate the words the
suggestion earlier made made by senator pimentel and the suggestion of this
representation made in plenary  long statement in tagalog 
""
may we request for uh the chair to instruct the secretary general to
look  words  to stay open  word  do not
contain s o vs by precinct and for the necessary representations to be made
by the chair probably to comelec for them to produce or make available at
least those copies so that at a proper time we will not be uh there will be
no delay insofar as this particular issue is concerned
""
and as a last point mr chairman i take it from the statements of the
honorable  word  and honorable abad that indeed if there
is no doubt as to the number of votes cast for president and vice president
there is no need to go down to either the s o v by precinct or 
words  the election returns
""
without conceding that point mr chairman i will hold them to their
word at a proper time
""
thank you 
""
""
""
mr speaker mr senate president distinguished colleagues in the house
and in the senate allow me to answer these issues raised before us
""
it is sad to note that the joint committee at the very onset was
plagued with partisan politics
""
the national board of canvassers should have been non-partisan in
carrying out its function of canvassing the votes cast for president and
vice-president
""
however unlike in previous years the composition of the joint
committee tasked to preliminarily canvass the votes were made to conform to
the majority-minority representation in the house and in the senate
""
hence as it turned out six members from the senate appointed to the
joint committee were allied with or supported a presidential candidate five
others supported another presidential candidate the other presidential
candidates have no representation much less a voice in the same
""
in the house of representatives eight members represented a candidate
or supported a candidate one represented three candidates however one
candidate was not represented at all except through an alternate member
""
 two sentences in tagalog 
""
in all of the decisions not a single decision was made wherein the
votes cast went beyond or below the representation of the majority in both
the senate and the house
""
 two sentences in tagalog 
""
but at the onset it was created precisely to function in that manner
""
 one long sentence in tagalog 
""
the second issue here we face is the issue or debate between the
election returns and the certificates of canvass
""
 one sentence in tagalog 
""
for the longest time mr speaker mr president a lot many members of
this august body have been saying that we cannot we are not authorized it is
illegal for us to go down to the returns
""
it was only now mr speaker mr president that an admission and a clear
admission at that was made that indeed congress could have should have voted
in that direction
""
it could have looked at the election returns
""
 five sentences in tagalog 
""
i thank the distinguished sponsors last night for on the record
making and giving that admission to lay the issue finally to rest
""
 one sentence in tagalog 
""
simply put the majority voted not to look at the return
""
 three sentences in tagalog 
""
serious allegations of fraud were made by counsels for the various
presidential candidates allegations which is unfair to say the least to the
candidate accused of fraud and yet the accusation was left alone
""
 two sentences in tagalog 
""
brother eddie villanueva wrote the joint committee and said that he
would have wanted at least three c o cs to be opened up for us to be able to
look at the election returns
""
 one sentence in tagalog 
""
just one c o c for us to find out two basic facts
""
 three sentences in tagalog 
""
second will it actually take us fourteen years to go down to the
returns
""
will it take us six hours as some claim
""
donÂ’t take our word for it neither will we take yours
""
 three sentences in tagalog 
""
it was said during the sponsorship speeches given in relation to the
majority report that not a single c o c was presented by any of the counsels
much less the opposition
""
 three sentences in tagalog 
""
it will be useless to compare our copy of the c o c with the six
other copies of the c o c
""
 three sentences in tagalog 
""
mr speaker mr president  whenever we asked that we go down to the
election returns  two-and-a-half sentences in tagalog 
""
mr speaker i listened intently to the speeches and interpellations
last night
""
 three sentences in tagalog 
""
mr speaker iÂ’m of the belief that whenever we see something wrong we
should at first sight seek to correct it
""
 four sentences in tagalog 
""
mr speaker it has been said also  that we seek to exclude certain
certificates of canvass by objecting to it thereby disenfranchising millions
of voters or thousands of voters
""
we seek mr speaker mr president not the exclusion of c o cs but
rather its deferment to find out the true and actual vote of our people
""
 three sentences in tagalog 
""
we seek not to accuse you as being cheaters rather we seek to fight
for the truth by ensuring that indeed you were not cheated in the last
elections because mr speaker mr president in the final analysis it is not the
candidate who was cheated of these elections
""
it was for all intents and purposes the filipino people and not the
candidate in whose favor they voted
""
mr speaker a while ago my good friend digs dilangalen quoted the
preamble
""
allow me to seek emphasis by ending my brief sponsorship to the
minority report in the reverse by citing the preamble which reads and states
within it
""
 we the sovereign filipino people imploring the aid of the
almighty god in order to build a just and humane society and establish a
government which shall embody our ideals and aspirations promote the common
good conserve and develop our patrimony and secure to ourselves and our
posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law
and a regime of truth justice love equality and peace do ordain this
constitution 
""
mr speaker mr president in the hierarchy of values the framers of
our constitution chose to put primordial among the rest the value of truth
over freedom over love over peace over justice
""
and mr speaker mr president that is all that we are asking for
""
distinguished colleagues whether or not watchers signed or did not
sign the c o c or the election returns will not and cannot change the truth
""
whether or not you vote for or against the committee report whether
or not you vote to look at the election returns it will not change the truth
""
if in a few minutes we vote in favor of a particular candidate it
will not change the truth
""
our votes in this hall cannot mr speaker mr president change the
truth
""
neither can time change the truth
""
i am for the truth mr speaker mr president because the truth is
unbiased
""
the truth as it has been said favors no one
""
this is beyond f p j this is beyond g m a
""
this is beyond any other candidate nor personality because in so far
as we are concerned mr speaker we will stand by and will always fight for the
truth however lonely that fight may be
""
thank you mr speaker distinguished colleagues 
""
""
""
uh mr speaker thank you mr speaker
""
uh mr speaker i believe that uh the  suspe  uh the
adjournment uh of congress as a legislative body does not affect our function
to canvass
""
thatÂ’s why uhm i believe that there is a distinction between the
legislative function and uh our mandate to canvass the votes of the president
and vice- president
""
if we look at the constitution uh mr speaker that provision to
canvass the votes of the president and vice-president is actually under the
executive branch of government uh with this uh article seven section four mr
speaker so even if we have already adjourned uh congress in its regular
session we emanate our power from this constitutional provision that congress
is tasked to canvass the votes for the president and vice-president that is
why it is in  er  the this provision the power to canvass is embodied
in article seven section four which is actually uh the article for the
executive department mr speaker because we are actually doing an
administrative function
""
so when we call congress in a joint public session that power mr
speaker is derived from uh article seven section four of the constitution and
it is not a legislative function it is indeed an executive function
""
thank you mr speaker 
""
""
""
thank you mr speaker
""
uh to our uh humble opinion the uh canvass must be an exception to
the adjournment  sine die 
""
it is an exception because uh otherwise there would be created a uh
situation where provisions of the constitution will run athwart each other
""
i say that uh although i would agree that uh a canvass is not a
special session it is a uh specific uh act given to congress empowered to
congress uh which would be the canvassing body that would proclaim ultimately
the president and the vice-president
""
so if we now adjourn uh  sine die  somehow there
would be created a grotesque situation where congress will still be
canvassing the votes for the president and the vice-president
""
i would say that if we follow the thirty-day rule of uh adjourning
 sine die  the general rule is adjournment  sine
die  when there is no presidential or vice-presidential election
""
but when there is a vice  preside  presidential and
vice-presidential election this is going to be an exception and that the
adjournment  sine die  should not uh be declared by
congress
""
congress has has uh to still proclaim the president and that if we
again adjourn  sine die  there would be we would endanger
that particular uh act of congress to still be existing at the time of the
proclamation so i say that this is an exception to the general rule of uh uh
the general rule mr speaker
