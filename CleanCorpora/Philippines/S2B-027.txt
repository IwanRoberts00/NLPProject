in march nineteen seventy-three six months after the declaration of martial law ninoy aquino was taken blindfolded from fort bonifacio and brought to a place he did not know 
""
he was stripped naked and thrown into a cell
""
his only human contact was a jailer
""
the immediate prospect in such a place was a midnight execution in front of a grave dug by himself 
""
the purpose was as clear as it was diabolical it was not to kill him yet but to break him first and with him break the compelling proof that men can stand up to a dictatorship
""
he came close to giving up he told me
""
he slipped in and out of despair but a power that must have been god held him together
""
he remembered the words of the epistle  god chose the weak to confound the strong 
""
on the third anniversary of his incarceration in laur the recollection of his pain gave birth to a poem of hope
""
this is the poem he wrote  i am burning the candle of my life in the dark with no one to benefit from the light
""
 the candle slowly melts away soon its wick will be burned out and the light is gone
""
if someone will only gather the melted wax reshape it give it a new wick for another fleeting moment my candle can once again light the dark be of service one more time and then goodbye   
""
this is the anguish of good men that the good they do will come to nothing that pains suffered in obscurity or sacrifices made away from the sight of men amount to the same and mock the man or woman who bears them
""
mr senate president mr speaker members of the congress distinguished guests my countrymen that is not true
 none of the good that we do is ever lost not even the light in an empty room is wasted
""
from ninoy 's burnt-out candle and thousands like it in cells throughout the garrison state we gathered the melted wax and made more candles to burn not as long in such loneliness but much more brightly altogether as to banish the darkness and light us to a new day
""
you might ask when will the president stop invoking ninoy 's name
""
my answer is when the president stands here other than by ninoy 's grace
""
and not while gratitude is nourished by memory not while we acknowledge that it was his sacrifice that gave us back our freedom and restored the freely elected office whose incumbent must stand every year in this place
""
five years have passed my term is ending and so is yours
""
as we came so should we go with grateful acknowledgment to the man who made it possible for us to be here a man who discovered hope in the starkest despair and has something yet to teach a country facing adversity again
""
it would be foolish to ignore what is staring us in the face
""
our march of progress brought us far but such misfortunes have come upon us as to make us feel that we are not much farther from where we started
""
the eruption of mount pinatubo is the biggest in this century
""
abroad its effect is so far-reaching as to lower the temperature of the earth
""
at home it is so devastating it knocked off eighty thousand productive hectares from our agriculture and destroyed the commerce of at least three provinces
""
hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes and livelihoods and thrown on the kindness of relatives and countrymen and on the solicitude of the state
""
it was an event so powerful it wiped out the largest military base in the pacific and changed the nature of our relationship with an old ally
""
in the wake of the volcanic eruption more has been revealed about that relationship than was covered by its ash 
""
before pinatubo there was the typhoon that cut a wide swath of destruction across the southern regions
""
and before that was the killer quake that cut off the northern parts of the country destroying billions of pesos in infrastructure causing the loss of billions more in foregone economic activities
""
it leveled the city of pines and buried children in the rubble of yet another city
""
but those natural calamities were preceded by another entirely the work of human hands the massive december nineteen eighty-nine military revolt that cut short a second economic recovery after the dislocation caused by the earlier august nineteen eighty-seven coup attempt
""
that one strangled the powerful rebound of the philippine economy after the edsa revolution 
""
i mention these calamities not to excuse the perceived shortcomings of my administration nor to brag about my indestructibility
""
i mention them so that we know where we are and why we are here and the exact requirements of the task to build up this country yet again
""
i mention them because i will compare them with what we had and lost
""
and then i will ask was it all in vain and i will answer it was not no more than a hero 's life is wasted 
""
by nineteen eighty-five the economy had contracted considerably
""
its rate of growth had been negative for two consecutive years
""
the country was at a standstill as if waiting only for the last rites to be performed
""
by nineteen eighty-six we had turned the economy around in less than a year
""
we improved on that performance the year after
""
the rate of unemployment was reduced
""
the volume of new investments significantly increased
""
new industrial projects were introduced
 hitherto idle industrial capacity was fully utilized
""
the foundation of new regional industrial zones was laid
""
public infrastructure and services strained under the load of expanding economic activity 
""
i mention this not to offset the shortcomings of the present with the achievements of the past
""
i mention it to show what can be done in such a short time and how much improvement was made from conditions far worse than what we have today the dictator 's apologies notwithstanding that the country is worse off now than when he and his wife were stealing the country blind
""
this progress was cut off by the august eighty-seven coup attempt
""
but the economy quickly rallied and in two years recovered a great deal of the ground we had lost
""
we were on the verge of a second take-off when the december nineteen eighty-nine coup broke out
""
it drained the last drop of confidence in our future from all but the hardiest spirits and shattered our image abroad 
""
still we persevered achieving gains that admittedly continue to fall short of the galloping needs of a fast growing population but real gains nonetheless
""
improved health care increased housing and one of the proudest achievements we share with the legislature free secondary education
""
six hundred sixty-thousand youth immediately availed themselves of it
""
another two hundred thousand private school students received scholarship grants under another recent law
""
eighty thousand new classrooms have been built
""
the first preparation of the nation for the future of economic competition which will take place in the highly educated minds of the youth
""
we have made the first serious effort to arrest environmental degradation already so far advanced in the previous regime that it set up an agency that did nothing about it anyway
""
we have pushed agrarian reform beyond the point of no return almost completing its coverage of rice and corn
""
its extension to other agricultural activities is proceeding at a pace consistent with our resolve to achieve for the farmer the prosperity promised by agrarian reform and not just its bare legal implementation
""
indeed we started to make up our losses and kept on going through the gulf crisis which doubled the price of energy and introduced the element of a tremendous uncertainty not only about our economy but that of the world as well
""
you might ask having lost so much so easily what was the worth of all that effort
""
with such reversals of fortune is progress for our country a hope in vain
""
paul says that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope
""
the good we do is never lost some of it remains if not in material goods then in a deeper experience a more practiced hand and a spirit made stronger by that which failed to break it stronger to meet greater challenges ahead
""
but in one thing we grew from strength to strength in the enlargement of our democratic space and the strengthening of our democracy
""
every calamity tested the capacity of democracy to absorb distress find relief and meet the absolute necessities of the people without the least curtailment of freedom or compromise of rights
""
against our economic gains that are ever hostages to fortune stands one steadfast unalloyed achievement our democracy destined i believe to outlive our problems and deck with the graces of liberty the material progress of our future
""
that achievement is better seen from the disinterested distance of foreign admirers than from the myopic view of those at home who wish to destroy it  applause 
""
it is an achievement entirely in our power to preserve and enhance
""
visitors from the new germany asked me what things strengthen democracy
""
economic progress naturally i said but the attainment of that depends on external factors more than on the will of a developing country
""
but there is a way to strengthen democracy that is within any country 's reach that is through the empowerment of the people
""
this is obvious to a government like ours that came to power by its means as well as to a people like the germans who attained complete freedom in the same way
""
but empowering the people means more than just giving them elections every three years
""
it means enlarging their contact with government beyond elections to its daily workings so that the vast resources of one support the initiatives of the other and the policies of government are refined by the insights of the people
""
 translation of previous sentence in filipino    ngunit ang pagkaloob ng kapangyarihan sa mamamayan ay nangangahulugan hindi lamang ng pagdaraos ng halalan tuwing ikatlong taon
 kailangang pagyamanin ang kanilang pagkakadiit sa pamahalaan sa araw-araw na gawain ng pamahalaan upang ang malawak na kayamanan ng isa ay makatulong sa mga pagkukusa ng kabila at ang mga patakaran ng pamahalaan ay paglinangin ng mga mamamayan 
""
by these means the lives of the people shall be constantly improved and the people themselves empowered by the habit of directing their own government
""
the constant revision of flawed policies and the wider application of good ones are possible only by bringing together the people and the government
""
people empowerment through people 's organizations n g os foundations and cooperatives is the surest means we know to make government mirror the aspirations of the people  applause 
""
in the past the idea was to give the people just enough power to elect their mistakes and suffer the consequences until the next elections
""
elections were a safety valve
""
we want elections to be just one of other more effective means to bring the people into government and government to the people to make it truly a participatory democracy
""
this is the only way to end the character of total war that elections have assumed where the aim is the division of spoils and the victims are not just the losers but those who voted for them too
""
such elections are like russian roulette where your chances are five to one your life will not improve and one to five you will blow out your brains
""
participatory democracy will end the practice of punishing provinces and municipalities for the wrong vote in the last poll
""
it will separate elections where the people vote for their favorites from the provision of public service which every filipino has a right to expect from the government regardless how he voted 
""
this administration has made large steps in that direction
""
to the disappointment of those who marched with me against the marcos regime my administration has plowed resources into regions and provinces where i was cheated in the snap elections
""
the politics of revenge has had its day
""
the organized  applause  the organized participation of the people in daily government may provide the stabilizing element that government has always lacked
 policies have radically changed with each administration yet the basic needs of its unchanging constituencies have not been met
 less bureaucracy for business more public services and infrastructure support for agriculture and industry  an  economic safety net for the common man
 the active participation of the people in government will lend proper direction and continuity to policy
 this is what i wish for most that after me the continuity of our work is not broken so that things well-done shall be completed and the same mistakes avoided
