but don't you just find the game  ex  really exciting
""
""
at first i couldn't i couldn't shout
""
i mean  when at during the first half
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uhm we 're way ahead of the f e u  far eastern university 
""
but then on the second half  i can't control myself  chuckle 
""
i 'm so nervous that i 'm afraid that we 'll  sounds uncertain  going to lose
""
""
yeah and  but you know  it was a bit unexpected because i 'm not really a basketball fan
""
but i actually had fun watching it
""
it was really exciting
""
and i was actually screaming and shouting and everything
""
""
did you know that i almost lost my voice because of the shouting and my hands were kind of getting red because of clapping
""
""
uhm
""
yeah my hands also they were itchy  chuckle  red from clapping
""
""
but i 'm so glad that we became the champions because at last even before i graduate or we graduate we were able to  i mean  uhm enjoy the    victory  the long awaited   victory 
""
""
 yeah    chuckle 
""
 victory  
""
""
oh by the way  did you hear the new policy that we 're asked to wear our i d 's in  sch  inside the school premises
""
""
yeah i heard about that
""
uh atty cruz
""
yeah
""
""
was it
""
""
yeah she went to our class and she announced about that policy
""
so what do you think about it
""
""
i don't know
""
uhm personally i don't want to wear i d 's inside the school
""
it 's just like  i 'm in uh high school  just like wearing id 's letting to know everybody who you are i mean just like that and everything
""
i don't know but if it 's for our safety then i 'm for it
""
""
yeah i agree with you
""
but then  uhm i i 'm a bit embarrassed by my i d  because it 's already in uh well bad condition  chuckle 
""
it 's covered with tape and everything  chuckle 
""
""
well  mine is still in good shape
""
but then  i 'm ashamed to show my picture during my first year in college
""
""
why what 's wrong with your picture
""
""
well i just don't feel like showing it to  the people
""
i i 'm planning to have ah i mean to secure a new i d
""
i don't know  if i can secure one this time
""
""
maybe you could
""
well as for me i think i have to because it 's in such a bad condition  break in the recording 
""
maybe we could even go together and secure both our i ds
""
""
oh you haven't changed your i d yet
""
""
not yet  laughter 
""
""
and now i 'm sure there 's a long line out there  for all  the people who want to secure a new i d just because they too are ashamed of their faces  laughter  during their freshman year
""
i know  laughter 
""
""
so have you heard of that incident i mean of the
""
""
brawls
""
""
yeah
""
""
i don't know when when atty cruz mentioned about the numerous brawls that occurred in la salle i was a bit surprised because i 've never witnessed one
""
i 've never even heard of one
""
how about you
""
""
me too uhm i just only learned through atty cruz
""
i don't know when that happened
""
i haven't seen one
""
i haven't heard one too
""
just from her
""
when was that
""
what   do you  think
""
""
 i think  
""
i mean i 'm not really sure
""
i 've i 've no idea
""
but then rumors has it that it 's between fraternities
""
""
yeah so i assume that if there will be  frat  fraternities which is very much i mean  they violate they are violating our
""
""
school policy
""
""
yeah school policy
""
they should be expelled from the school
""
is it  break in the recording 
""
""
but that 's part of the problem
""
they were not able to identify who the participants were
""
so that 's why they insisted on the i d policy
""
""
didn't you know that the students of velasco i mean the engineering students were already obliged to wear their i d inside their building
""
""
why only in velasco
""
""
i think in gokongwei too
""
i mean maybe that 's one of their reasons for safety and security
""
so maybe our department i mean c b e  college of business and economics  is trying to follow them i think
""
i just don't know
""
""
why
""
does the brawl occur in velasco and gokongwei most of the time
""
""
not necessarily but i heard that one incident  hap  happened when uhm there 's a brawl which happened in front of a d o  = discipline officer  imagine that
""
""
oh they 're really brave  ha 
""
""
yeah
""
""
so what did the d o  = discipline officer  do
""
""
i don't know
""
i haven't heard much of that news
""
maybe i can just ask one of my friends to tell me more about that
""
""
when you find out you tell me all the details
""
""
oh sure
""
speaking of problems uhm i think i may need your advice
""
""
why
""
what happened
""
""
well  word  well i 've been having problems with my best friend lately
""
remember him
""
""
yeah
""
""
well  i don't know how i can call it but  i think uhm we 've got uhm we don't no longer communicate nowadays
""
""
what exactly happened
""
""
well for one thing  i decided to cut
""
""
the   communication 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
why why did you do that
""
""
well i don't know
""
i 've been thinking it for ages now and i think it was just  parang  now is just the time that i woke up or  i 'm really in my senses that
""
i don't know
""
""
did he do something wrong to you
""
""
yeah he
""
would i just cut our communication if he didn't did something wrong
""
""
what exactly did he do
""
""
well for me  what he did was unforgivable  as in unforgivable
""
i 've heard that he was a bit intimidated by me
""
i don't know why
""
""
intimidated by you
""
""
yeah
""
""
why would he feel that
""
""
i don't know
""
i haven't realized that 'till then 'till now
""
i mean uhm haven't i told you before that he was about last  sum  just this vacation   summer  he was about to give me something but then he was thinking twice of giving it to me because he thinks that i won't i won't be using it
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
but you 've been best friends for such a long time   and  so why is he feel intimidated by you now
""
""
 yes  
""
""
i mean you know it just doesn't make sense
""
""
me too me and my friends are wondering why
""
uhm i don't know about him
""
i asked him about that but he seems quiet that that topic will be talked about
""
""
he just doesn't want to talk about it
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh but maybe he has developed some feelings for you
""
""
i don't know hope not 'cause i don't know how to deal with it
""
""
but do you like him
""
""
yeah but just for a friend
""
""
just for a friend and now you miss him
""
""
obviously
""
i 'm  the incident last summer was just i mean was just nothing
""
i i decided not to think more about it anymore but then uhm it happened again just during this sem break
""
well it was one sunday night when he asked me to go to his place
""
it 's because it was his younger brother 's birthday
""
i was kind of hesitant then because i was too shy to go to their place especially meeting his parents
""
haven't you realized that
""
""
why
""
""
well i don't know but the real  it wasn't any problem with his invitation
""
in fact i was too eager to go to his place uhm but then during our conversation i mean on the phone when we 're talking on the phone uhm he was kind of i think he decided not to
""
""
to invite you
""
""
yeah to invite me anymore
""
""
did you say something to him that made him change his mind
""
""
none at all
""
in fact uhm i was kind of he he knew that i was so excited but then he reasoned out that he was just too shy of himself to let to let
""
""
you
""
""
yeah to let me show their place
""
it 's because he feels that i 'm i mean too rich i mean for him
""
just like that matters like that
""
""
but the fact that you and he are best friends for such along time i mean doesn't that mean anything to him 
""
doesn't he realize that you 've when you 've decided to be friends with him that you have already accepted him
""
""
that 's what i don't ah that 's what i didn't expect from him
""
that 's what i don't understand from him
""
imagine we 've been friends for five years now and it was only this time that he brought this the topic up
""
so i was thinking that he was he already had  2 words  in his mind before
""
""
but why is it only now that he act that way
""
""
i don't know
""
when i told my friends about that they too are wondering  why the sudden change in his attitude
""
""
are you sure you didn't say or do anything 
""
""
no i didn't do anything wrong
""
i never remember doing anything that might hurt him
 so with that conclusion i think uhm i mean he did that to me once during summer vacation so i think if he won't be able to accept me for who i am then it 's just useless to continue our friendship
""
""
but it 's such a waste to  you know to let your friendship go like that
""
""
yeah and i agree with you with that uhm but then i can't do anything
""
i don't see any point in continuing our  friendsh  or keeping our friendship if he behaves like that
""
