well uh good morning everybody i also would like to thank you for the privilege to speak in here even though i was informed only yesterday i really enjoy talking to students about computers that 's why since uh i don't have any commitments at this time i readily accepted the the invitation i really enjoy talking to students well as far as the career opportunities in computer science or computer application to be more specific is concerned well let 's answer first this question let 's go first with the demand 'no maybe you want to ask yourself okay i think uh i understand that you are freshmen and sophomores here so maybe after two or three years will there be a job for me in the computer industry the answer is a definite yes okay as early as as late as nineteen eighty-one the demand for information technology people so i 'm using the word information technology to be more general i 'm not using the word computer science 'no  i 'm using the information technology because uh this is the term we use for people who are in the computer industry so you 're not necessarily it 's not really required that you be a computer science graduate in order to be part of the computer industry as long as you are working with computers you are part of that industry so the demand for information technology specialists or people is placed at about thirty-five thousand 'no  that was in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety-one and at that point it was estimated that less than forty percent of the companies here are computerized so the demand is already thirty-five thousand and yet only forty percent of the of our entire industry is computerized so if you try to place it wherein if uh we place the level of computerization to one hundred percent then probably if there 's a direct relationship between the two the demand would rise up to seventy to eighty thousand professionals now is that number big or small you might think eighty thousand parang napakaliit  maybe by the time i graduate puno na 'yung eighty thousand na 'yun  okay let 's again look at figures let 's just look at la salle probably just the college of computer studies because i don't know the exact population of the other programs with uh major in computer applications so if you look at it the the college of computer studies can only produce about three hundred graduates a year so try to see that with eighty thousand so three hundred out of eighty thousand i think you can compute already the percentage there and la salle is already considered as one of the the biggest school in computer science meaning to say our population 'yung three hundred na 'yon malaki na 'yon  ateneo we accept about uh four hundred freshmen a year ateneo accepts only about one hundred u p about roughly the same figure so if we combine all computer schools 'no there are only a few uh universities and colleges offering computer-related programs probably we 're only producing uh about one thousand that would be an optimistic figure one thousand information technology specialists a year so just think thirty-five and then eighty thousand so definitely by the time you graduate maybe the demand for eighty thousand may not be even filled by twenty-five percent and maybe just perform an experiment just look at maybe on a sunday maybe you buy a newspaper uh then look at the jobs required you will see there uh usually b s in whatever required the age so on and so forth pleasing personality and then at the end computer those with computer background will have an advantage okay so definitely in terms of your question of the demand yes there is that tremendous demand and even up to now we cannot even fill it up and we cannot really expand there has been pressure for the college of computer studies to expand its population but with our limited uh campus size and facilities we cannot do that right now there are about one thousand eight hundred students in our college and we cannot grow uh beyond that unless that we find some other campus to build a new building so your question about the demand yes you are needed now the other question is if i 'm not a computer science graduate can i make it in the field of computers again the answer is yes okay especially in your course uh it 's uh b s math if you choose b s math with computer applications you also have an advantage i myself am not a computer science graduate okay i virtually don't know how to program when i finished my degree in e c e that was well they mentioned already the year that was in eighty-four i 'd like to say eighty-eight or something but uh since they mentioned it during that time when i was taking up my computer courses we had only a small machine a p d p eight which right now i think you can buy a calculator that is much more powerful than that machine and it was considered alrea already during that time a mini-computer 'no  and they were only teaching us basic so if you look at my knowledge when i graduate compared with the knowledge that you will have when you graduate i think you are in a better position than i was when i graduated way back in eighty-four and yet i was able to uh enter this particular field okay because uh comput the the beauty about computers is that you don't need really a b s c s degree in order to succeed in it 'no  people have been studying computers ever since in fact if you look at it the very first computer professionals were not even b s c s graduates because wala pang c s program la salle was the first one to offer a b s c s program and that was in nineteen eighty-one and computers were here as early as the sixties and the seventies so don't have that apprehension that hindi naman ako computer science graduate i am basically a b s math graduate therefore i cannot make it in the industry but like i said you will have several units of computer subjects so you will be in a better position than most students who will be graduating with just a plain degree without any major uh as far as computers are concerned so as far as that question naman is concerned yes you are needed by the industry so don't worry about not being a c s graduate okay so you have already the the only skill really needed okay in computer science is or computer applications or computer industry is logic formulation okay of which you will i think it will be taught to you in one of your programming subjects and uh i 've looked at your curriculum and uh i 've seen that most of the computer foundations are found in your curriculum that means you will have that necessary background in order to enter the information technology field of course i already suggested this last year when i gave the same talk uh if you uh entering as a programmer will be no problem as far as you are concerned because you will be given the fundamental theories in programming but being la sallites i think you are worth more than just being programmers okay the mere fact that you were chosen uh about we accepted about two hundred two thousand uh freshmen all colleges 'no two thousand out of possibly ten to twelve thousand applicants that means you are capable okay of being of being of doing more than just mere programming so the the nice thing about this talk is that i 'm doing it now for freshmen and sophomores so at least you can prepare yourselves 'no  if ever you do decide to take up this major okay i would suggest uhm if you want to raise the level of your computer uh literacy you can also take up some courses that are not offered in your curriculum okay or you cannot you don't really have to go through a formal uh schooling as far as computers is concerned i myself never really enrolled formally in any uh school when i learned everything about computers okay i started my masteral degree in eighty-eight so between nineteen eighty-four and eighty-eight it 's just self-study so you may want you may opt to do that or we have a a program here the impact program it 's an office wherein they 're offering short term courses so for example if uh i i would suggest fields like systems analysis and design okay that is a field that is that is again another area wherein we need a lot of people there so you 're not really when you say systems analysis you 're not really programmers 'no  you just study the system and then develop some sort of algorithms wherein you want to improve the system and then the programmers will just implement your suggestions we need people like this so they have a good course there in systems analysis and design so you may want to especially during your term break 'no uh of course i 'm not suggesting that you be nerds that even your term break would be spent on studying but if you have nothing better to do let 's say on a summer then maybe it 's worth your time if you want to spend okay a little time of your vacation in taking up courses like this at least it will prepare you 'no probably in your third or fourth year you may want to do that 'no uh amidst maybe the difficulties of your thesis you may find some time in undergoing courses like this it will be helpful definitely 'no  the other area that you may want to go through would be uh familiarization with mainframes 'no  we have a mainframe here the forty-three eighty-one although if you look at the trend now in the industry mainframes are sort of like pass&eacute; 'no uh everybody is going into smaller machines let 's say four eighty-six machines and then just connecting them in a network as opposed to the expensive mainframes so your question might be why should i study mainframes 'no  but in the context of the philippine computer industry majority of our the companies here are still using mainframes okay they cannot just junk it and then replace them with newer machines because they already invested millions of pesos so definitely in order for you to succeed in the philippines as far as computer science is concerned then maybe a knowledge or a background in mainframe utilization would be helpful okay so again impact will have well i 'm not from impact so don't think that i 'm commercializing them i 'm just like giving out suggestions 'no  although maybe your organization math circle may come up with an arrangement with computer services center wherein maybe they can come up with uh simple mainframe fami familiariza familiarization seminars okay for you people somewhere in your third or fourth year okay because we have a mainframe here and of course you are free to use it as long as uh the utilization during that time is quite low and of course i would suggest if you have let 's say a personal computer at home then maximize its usa its usage learn computer packages like uh database i would suggest areas in spreadsheets and database management okay there are a lot of programs that uh you can use in order to learn these concepts usually these are not taught in school because well you don't really need a formal subject in order to teach uh how to use a certain computer package you can study this on your own there are a lot of textbooks nowadays you 're lucky textbooks are available locally as far as using computer packages like da d-base four clipper fox base all of these can be used easily don't be scared about the name fox base  it sounds like a zoo 'no  so don't be afraid of the name these are very easy to use and you have alre we have already the literature even in the library we have a good uh collection of computer science books and they 're not just for c s people they 're for everybody okay so you may want to go to the library we have uh we spent we spent a lot of money acquiring these books so for the meantime that 's what you can do in order to prepa prepare yourself for a career in the computer industry so what are the possible jobs available so you know already that there 's a demand so what now can you do in the field of computers well of course the the entry level okay that you may want to come into in a certain company would be a programmer by the way when you see the word wanted data encoder do not apply okay because you might think data encoder sounds complicated it 's like a nice career no okay it 's not okay so let 's get that clear because some people would say okay for a computer uh a person who graduated with a degree relating related to computers the entry level would be a data encoder no okay the data encoder is just there to copy something and type it on a computer that 's everything that you have to know about data encoding
