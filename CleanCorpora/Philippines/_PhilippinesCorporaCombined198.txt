finally this team this russian team gets the second place in pool b in the preliminaries and cuba on the other hand is currently in third place in the team standing from the pre preliminary in pool pool a losing uh two matches against brazil and the netherlands in three straight sets but winning the matches against spain in three three sets to one and uh egypt three straight sets and australia also in three straight sets and the winner of this match will end up going up against the winner of the brazil argentina match and here we go  now you should watch out for yakolev of russia number ten and in the cuban side dennis angel dennis who can really fly sev yes and this is our first sit-in into the men 's competition because of the schedule that we 've followed here and the men 's game mas mabilis ano mas uh   yes this is much faster yes  that 's right this is really fast and uh you know if you 're used to seeing power volleyball in the women the men 's uh well you know of course it 's expected that it 's gonna be faster because of the power of these uh these guys so how each one manages the power dealt by each other will be the factor here and you were absolutely correct yakolev with that point  sobra lumilipad talaga si yakolev  yakolev also is quite tall standing six seven but you know it was really an interesting match these russians played against the koreans because uh they really didn't expect that  they almost lost that match  sabi mo nga nung bus trip natin papunta rito medyo nakakapanghinayang din na nawala yung mga koreans because they did quite well in the course of the tournament   yes yes  and uh last night we we saw that match the americans going up the korean women  sa women 's ano  that was really something else and uh the koreans almost got that one and they could have just moved to the semi-finals already   yes  and snatched that one from the americans as of the moment this stands at three two in favor of the russians however it it 's the cubans who will be serving pavel pimienta now on your screen to serve  tapos agad ang puntos ano laughter   oh what a shot  that 's that was olikhver of russia  words pati yung first name niya russian words  jump serve go to the right strong one what a shot osvaldo hernandez stands six eight his serve strong one again from hernandez as yakolev is easily putting that one over from the left it 's den angel dennis the cuban squad extremely loaded unveiling quickly the arsenal of strength now who will be craftier here scrappier perhaps may have the edge let 's see let 's let this game flow hernandez nice service there  alam mo sev yang si angel dennis uh he 's he is actually short 'no he 's uh compared to the other players he 's just six four but that guy can really hit the ball way up you know he can fly  karamihan naman dito talagang lumilipad e  sometimes uh small but terrible e di ba  actually sa t v mukhang hindi ganun kalaki 'no pero pag katabi ninyo silang nag-aantay kayo ng bus diyan sa labas mukha kaming mga dwende kahit sa women 's side ano  that 's true and the winner from tetyukhin of russia talk about height anong average height ng cuba six six yeah  sa kabilang panig naman and uh we 'll see this point being played while we check out the average height of the russian side the russian side the average height six seven that 's tall hernandez putting that one away going down in the russian squad is tetyukhin too strong here 's the team captain yosvany hernandez  that 's a club   patay na ang puntos oo  not being able to get that one he was blocked you know kazakhov is quite a big quite a tall uh player seven one ano  oh yeah he is always there you know when you need him to make points but that that error is from kazakhov  alam mo itong sa international volleyball ano patuloy na na nare- redefine yung game dati-dati hindi mo makikita ang mga seven one pupunta na ng basketball yan but now dami nang seven one ano  and russia can like that gentleman on your screens right now that is the gentleman who stands seven one yakolev it goes to the left down the line there was there was a touch the point goes to cuba and the score now is eight seven because this is the first technical time-out when we reach the level of eight we press the button for the first technical time-out we 'll use it break in recording   patuloy po ang olympic volleyball attack points over the cub cubans seeding at an efficien efficiency rate rather of seventy-five percent the attack points six to four the edge to the cubans  hindi nagtatagal ang bola walang uh hindi na umiikot ano   ang game is set attack set attack and who overpowers the other is going to be the trend here that 's men 's volleyball for you eight all diago  hammering that down was number six of cuba ivan benito ruiz cuesta a long name sev  oo galit siya nung grade one kasi ang daming isusulat na pangalan e  that 's right from the back that was tetyukhin swept over by the cubans' back set  huli  well done and the cubans getting that point from the net angel dennis stands six four doing an excellent job of protecting their surface and protecting them from any kind of attack the cubans ahead now by two back set that 's in great shot name   alam mo sa men 's volleyball mas nagiging more valuable yung role nung libero kung minsan yung mga uh announcers natin sa australia libero italian yan pero itong libero ang gagamitin natin  so sa power game ano importante ang laro ng libero ano  oh yeah it is interesting to note that sev in the women 's team there is no libero but in the men 's team   sa cuba sa cuba  there is there is a libero   kanya-kanyang philosophy e  the cuban team which is uh going to go up against brazil in a major major showdown in the women 's category  they 're actually looking for a double e  that 's tomorrow they 're looking for a double  if the women can score because the volleyball program in uh that area 'no cuba brazil malutong  uh cubans playing well here ano   great blocking   malutong  single blocking there by hernandez blocking yakolev of russia as you mentioned the cubans ending up only in third place in their pool which is pool a dropping two matches and uh anything can happen here because one loss you 're gone that 's right  just like last night   yes  the the u s almost lost that match against the koreans that 's it olikhver not successful over the net  natutuwa talaga ako dito sa back-up dancers yung nasa nagwa- warm up sa kanto endless stretching yan e ano  oh yes because they can be called to play anytime   anytime  anytime they don't occupy the bench e   sa culture ng volleyball ayaw nilang paupuin lahat ng players dun sa bench area yun lang pinalitan ipapalit at saka yung mga kailangan lang  and do you know the people who were there at the phil sports at the grand prix they 're pretty familiar with that already because they saw they saw liela barros there a lot of times   oo  because she hardly played because she had an injury and she wasn't playing at her best but i think she 's playing very well oh she 's playing very well in the olympics  her heart out here   laughter look at these russians trying to pursue that one tetyukhin tetyukhin did not want to give up that was way outside the cubans are dictating the flow of this first set fourteen eleven they are ahead here 's dennis angel angel dennis with uh jump service tetyukhin now blocked  pero pasok  that 's in  pasok  cubans getting another point there fifteen eleven now cubans doing a little of everything not allowing the russians to get any of their cannons firing and uh the cubans just simply awesome here on the first set two teams counterpart of the two best teams here in the world in fact cuba and russia in the women 's volleyball  now we 're seeing the men   service a service a unleashed that time  and the russian side has fallen behind as we hit our second technical time-out we will be back break in recording  volleyball quarterfinals you 're seeing russia against cuba you know in attack perce percentage uh seventy-five percent for cuba and fifty sixty percent for russia so cuba has been hitting a lot of balls there in this first set and already the russians have committed two errors it used to be the cubans with four and just in about every statistical category the cubans have the edge and the score reveals and confirms that particular advantage those advantages in fact  ang ganda nung style nitong si angel ano uh si dennis angel ano  oh yes  sa side view muna tapos saka niya pakakawalan  he really has a different or unique kind of uh service from the back right hernandez through the blockers of the russians that 's hernandez the cubans ano kita mo inspired ano inspired ang laro nila well because they 're ahead ano  but at the same time they 're playing at a very high energetic level the russians keep in mind lost only once and that was as maila mentioned to the italians four sets yun the rest of the win nahirapan sila nahirapan sila sa korea kagaya ng nasabi mo 'no three two yun  oh yes five setter bang hanep  there goes to the tall one kazakhov hammering that one kazakhov kazakhov seven one ang kanyang tindig gaya ng nabanggit natin kanina nagalit  all his might up and down there gamaliel to serve good one  diago back set to hernandez off the blockers the cubans getting another point eighteen twelve is our score here in the first set cubans getting so much success off the spike off the attack team captain hernandez committing a 1 word there here 's the tall guy kazakhov of russia to serve diago goes to the left great shot ivan benito ruiz cuesta snicker long name cuesta walang problema kay cuesta na yan despite the presence of that double coverage and the preparation of the back row that was successful  huli   that 's center back   ang ganda ng depensa ng cuba gamaliel and there goes uh good shot off the blockers name  nineteen fourteen now one of the rare times that the russians get something off the block from the left blocked that 's in russia getting that point yes two successive points by the russians and trying to inch in here because they don't want the cubans to reach twenty kasi pag twenty diyan diretso na this this set oo   that 's the route  this set is going into fifteen minutes now diago quickly goes to pavel pimienta  alam mo when you need points in uhm flash the quick set is the best way to go kasi walang walang aksaya e   sure is   walang chance for the block hirap nahirap ang block diyan  here goes the rally point  that 's the exciting thing with volleyball   uh actually  good serve from gamaliel  great dig yakolev gets the point fourteen sixteen now is our score the russians trying to come back  saka parang nagpapainit 'no malamig ang flies by maybe they 'll be better in the second set let 's see  hernandez wow  malutong ang spikes ng mga cubano   alam mo ang na no- notice natin kaagad yun ang confidence mag- toss  alam nila ang gagawin nila kaagad walang uh second guessing actually pareho tayo 'no swack tayo dun nagagalingan tayo sa mga setters dito   of course this is world-class volleyball  oo e  but then you know the setting is the hardest hardest position in volleyball  oo galit sa yo ang mundo pag words  oh yakolev yakolev russia is trying to bounce back here yakolev got a winner  here 's olikhver now to serve this is the quarterfinals both teams naturally want to be in the semi  hay mali ang libero   gamaliel   lumusot lumusot yes ball handling error from the libero and the replay
